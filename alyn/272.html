<p> Island and AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Mr. Jones.<br/>
 Yes, baby.<br/>
 Episode 272.<br/>
 Right here, right now.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 Here we are.<br/>
 We recorded this episode in two stages.
 You're going to hear an interview with our friend Benjamin Jackson momentarily.
 We recorded that earlier in the week because he was here.
 Yes.<br/>
 This since last, they're not here.<br/>
 So I've been editing that part in preparation for this part and I was watching the video
 and I didn't have you to tell me, oh, baby, your hair is a mess.
 Now, for those of you who got the video, you can tell my hair is a mess.
 It is long overdue for a haircut.<br/>
 I thought I'd gone away with it, but the whole time I'm editing, there's like at the
 back, my hair's all boo-fung at the back.
 The other thing is...<br/>
 Well, right now it's kind of like a cockatoo at the front.
 So you have both looks going on.<br/>
 That's pretty fantastic.<br/>
 The other thing, and only the curious,
 maybe the eagle eyed viewers will spot this,
 but the interview itself that I filmed with Ben
 was in two parts, 'cause I don't know,
 one of his kids had an upset stomach or something like that.
 We shot it for a bit, then we went to go upstairs.
 Meanwhile, my kids got, you know,<br/>
 they had a shower, they're getting ready for bed,
 and one of the girls came down,<br/>
 I forget which one, and gave me a hug.
 I was sitting on the sofa, and she just kind of laid down.
 And then when I got up, I didn't realize
 that her wet hair, my whole shirt,<br/>
 it's just got a big wet patch.<br/>
 So I was like, yeah, I'll just own that right now.
</p><ul>
  <li>Okay, well that's exciting.
 I can't wait to watch.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, nerdy member only viewer glitches.
 We need to do a proper weekly update.
 'Cause it's been two weeks since we've been on the air.
  </li><li>It has.
  </li><li>We took a week off work.
  </li><li>We did.
  </li><li>Because our good friends, Bancier Jackson,
 along with their tribe of gorgeous girls,
 River, Emily and Sophia.
  </li><li>Was three a tribe?
 I guess it came-- - Well, the five of them,
 the Jackson Five. - Okay, the Jackson Five.
  </li><li>Came to stay with us.
 We took, like I said, a week off work.
 How was that for you?
  </li><li>It was great.
  </li><li>Why is your voice so high?
  </li><li>It was great.
 It was good, I mean--
  </li><li>It was good. - It was good.
  </li><li>Trying to balance that the other way.
 I forget we did the math, but we've been friends for,
 I don't know, well over two decades.
  </li><li>Yeah. - And it was just lovely
 to just sit around, hang out, chat, read, drink coffee,
 you know, just watch movies, watch movies,
 watch our kids play together and yeah, just have a good time.
  </li><li>We also did a second Christmas
 'cause they were supposed to come for Christmas
 and they couldn't. - Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>So we had a whole Christmas day.
  </li><li>We did. - We had a present,
 had a tree, - Made Christmas dinner.
  </li><li>Christmas dinner, made dance pies.
  </li><li>Yep, the whole bit.
  </li><li>I really liked that. - Yep.
 Second, it's like Thanksgiving, then Christmas,
 then second Christmas, who's up for making that
 an international holiday.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Second Christmas, yeah.
  </li><li>And Sarah was here for her birthday,
 so that was really fun.
  </li><li>She was.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>We got to redeem an experience.
 I don't know if we talked about this on the podcast.
 When you turned 50, I took you to a really nice
 steakhouse here in Franklin called Perry's.
 Not to be confused with Spareys with an ass.
  </li><li>Right, which is different.
  </li><li>Which is a different steakhouse, but Perry's,
 it's right opposite Whole Foods in Franklin.
 cool springs. And when we went on your 50th, it was terrible.
 Yeah, it wasn't a good experience. I was really disappointed.
 Yeah. And I spoke to the manager and just said, look, you know, I
 want you to succeed during my backyard. Here's where you're
 competing with. Here's where you're right. And he's like, look,
 I am so sorry about that. Thank you for telling me rather than
 telling Yelp, would you come back? And I said, yeah, what do
 you give me this card? And so we came back for Sarah's birthday
 and I'm pleased to say we have a phenomenal time.
  </li><li>Such a good time.
 Yeah, everything was better.
 Like, and the food was fantastic.
  </li><li>On behalf of service, food.
 Ben ordered a pork chop that is seven fingers tall.
  </li><li>Was 38 ounces.
  </li><li>It was couch.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>What did you eat?
 What did you eat?
 What did you eat?
  </li><li>I ate a filet.
 Filet, I mean, yeah.
 It was great.
  </li><li>Yeah, well, I had a rubi that I couldn't finish.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I brought home and had it the next day.
 and the vegetables were great.
  </li><li>Anyway, great experience.
  </li><li>So good.
  </li><li>Perries, if you're looking for somewhere to celebrate.
  </li><li>Great.
  </li><li>Great stuff.
  </li><li>So good.
 What else did we do?
  </li><li>You and Sarah had a last minute,
 John to Atlanta, a girls trip.
  </li><li>We did, whoop boop.
 Yeah, she needed a passport.
 And so she had to go to the consulate in Atlanta for that.
 So we did an overnight stay.
  </li><li>You volunteered to go with her,
 which was very kind.
  </li><li>I know, I was so kind of me.
  </li><li>That's the cost of friendship.
 Well, me and Ben held, held down the fort with children.
 six children. Yeah, you did great though.
 So yeah, great to see Ben and Sarah.
 They're off. You're going to meet Ben in a moment when you hear his story.
 They are in a major life transition.
 And I thought it'd be fun to hear from them.
 How do you navigate major life transition?
 Yeah, such a good question.
 I was super encouraged by what Ben shared.
 Yeah, because we're kind of in a transition of ourselves.
 Just a little bit.
 Why did I say ourselves?
 The other funny thing of our own?
 Of our own. Yeah.
 Listen back to our interview.
 I miss out words when I speak.
 I mean, I'm sure our listeners are aware of that.
 I just drop whole words.
 I know.
 Is it my enthusiasm or is it my brain?
 I don't know.
 OK.
 Yeah.
 Let's go with enthusiasm.
 OK.
 Speaking of transitions, give us, give the fine people adoption update.
 Um, oh, well, we are currently waiting to hear about a baby.
 This is another another baby.
 So yeah, we're just waiting to hear and see if the mom chooses us.
 And if she does, then that baby is doing less than three weeks.
 And if she doesn't, then we are back to waiting.
 And I'm really good with either.
 You're really good with waiting?
 Well, I'm good with either.
 Or getting a brand new baby in three weeks.
 I'm just like, I'm flexible.
 I know.
 But I'm just sort of like, Lord, I trust you.
 Like you started this and somehow it's all going to come together.
 I.
 Yeah.
 Who are you?
 And what have you done with my shaper wife?
 I know.
 Well, let's be honest.
 If it comes back tomorrow and she says, yes, she chose you, I will then kick into very high
 shaper.
 Look forward to next week's episode.
 I won't be on next week episode because I'll be getting things ready for the baby now.
 But yeah, but I'm just confident that whether it's this baby or another baby, it's, you know, God's got this.
 So yeah, that was our weekly update.
 Yeah.
 I'm going to hand over to previous Alan, interviewing Ben about their major life transition.
 And the reason I wanted them on the show to talk about, I say them, Sarah couldn't come on,
 but you've heard Sarah before, she's talked about dream interpretation before.
 Is I think you'll find some of your story as they tell their story.
 And I was super encouraged.
 I hope you are too.
 Benjamin Jackson.
 Welcome back.
 Thanks.
 a long overdue return. Your last episode was episode 48. A lot of stuff has changed in
 sense. Way before video. Way before video. Now, everybody gets to see the glory.
 I noticed something I haven't touched about. You've been staying with us for about a week.
 We've been doing life for Franklin, Tennessee, making sure that you're up to date and going
 five dollars and all that sort of stuff.
 Eating our way through, frankly.
 Oh, yeah.
 Yeah.
 And I was wondering, because everyone I introduce you to, I introduce you to us, oh, this is
 Ben, this is Sarah Jackson's husband.
 And I'm wondering what that's like because for people in our audience who don't know
 Ben, you're kind of a big deal in the environment you come from.
 Right?
 everybody in our world knows Sarah, 'cause Sarah comes in,
 she speaks at Emone, she speaks at the school,
 she's done our podcast, so everyone knows Sarah Jackson,
 she's a dream interpreter person.
 And we've talked about this in the past,
 but what it's like when you come here,
 what has it been like this week hearing yourself
 repeatedly being introduced as Sarah's husband?
  </li><li>I don't think it's foreign to me,
 it's not foreign to me here in this environment.
 But I grew up and my dad was the pastor of the church,
 So I got quite used to being introduced as,
 oh, this is Clive Jacksonson.
 And then when I came to Toronto,
 which was like 15 years ago,
 Sarah had already been there for nine, 10 years
 by that point.
 And so when we started going out,
 people didn't know me, but they knew her.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And so in that environment, it was like,
 oh, this is, in fact, I remember,
 one specific event where I was introduced as,
 this is Sarah's new boyfriend.
 And I was like, oh,
 it was opposed to Sarah's old boyfriend.
 like, "Sorry, what?"
  </li><li>But I have to say, it's always a unique experience
 coming here because this is one of the places where we come
 where Sarah has more function and more purpose,
 I would say, to offer.
  </li><li>And therefore equity.
  </li><li>Right.
 And so it is interesting.
 It's sometimes a big challenge for my heart
 to be like, "Oh, how does it feel, Ben,
 "when you're not needed?"
 And that's been a common theme often when we come here.
 Is I like, oh, actually I'm--
 Who am I without my exactly?
 And for those of you who don't know Ben,
 if you were to go to Toronto,
 I mean, we should probably tell how we met.
 But before we do that,
 so we're gonna talk about your transition second.
 You have just left Toronto.
 Like literally just left Toronto,
 both physically and also employment.
  </li><li>And employment, yes.
 And you lived in Toronto for how many years?
  </li><li>15 years.
 seniors came into the school of ministry, then came on staff as a
 smoker leader, and then really quite literally worked your way up.
 And your job role, I don't even know the problem.
 It's a very impressive.
 I'm never sure whether to, you know, to curtsy or bow.
 But what's your proper, what was your proper title?
 Executive director, like global executive director, and then vice
 president of global communications.
 Okay, so in Toronto and around the world,
 people who are in the catch the fire stream
 know who you are, big cheese, big deal.
 You're also worship leader, so you're well known
 in catch the fire.
 And then when you come here, you're Sarah's husband
 or River's dad.
 Right, right.
 So I often come to hold her Bible
 and just make sure that I have fresh water bottles
 ready open for her.
 Fiji, nothing less.
 Nothing less for Sarah.
 'cause she's got a vicious backhand.
 If you try and give her a perrier.
  </li><li>Big time. - Or Evya.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh, that woman I'm kidding.
 She's like Evya all know.
  </li><li>So we met, do you remember the circumstances
 of when we met?
  </li><li>Well, I think you were my teacher.
 I was teaching something, I remember.
  </li><li>I think you were teaching advanced prophetic
 'cause I remember you talking about realms
 of the supernatural that were like explosive in my mind.
 Like I was just, you know, I remember those conversations.
 Yes.
 I remember you being very earnest in between sessions.
 Then you married Sarah.
 Well, you helped with that.
 Well, I mean, I just don't know.
 Yes, AJ and I, mostly my wife,
 'cause I'm terrible at matchmaking.
 But AJ and I had a vested interest
 in seeing you and Sarah get together.
 'Cause you were amazing, she's amazing.
 We were like, this has to happen.
 And it was kind of that like, do you like her?
 you like him? But then honestly, I wanted to say this publicly, you never gave away that she
 likes me. I felt like you were encouraging me to aim for the grandiose heights of Sarah Dally as
 she was then. But I never felt that you gave away that she likes me. So I think you did matchmaking
 very, very well. Oh, well, thank you. I just don't have a great track record in it.
 Usually I'm like, I think them and them would be great together.
 And everybody in my community is like, what are you talking about?
 So I've just, I've, I've stopped, but you know, I'd like to take
 credit, but it was mostly AJ, you know, profits.
 And so for the last, how many years have you been?
 In Toronto for 15, 15, Sarah's been there 24, 24 years.
 You guys would be main stay features in Toronto.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 We were part of the senior leadership team of the church and the movement around the world.
 Absolutely.
 You go conferences, go to events.
 We'd see you were running all the events for a long period of time.
 So literally like key, you know, central figures to a movement that's hosted revival
 around the world for the last, I don't know how many years.
 Yeah, right.
 I thought it would be fun.
 Maybe it wouldn't be fun for you.
 But it'd be fun to talk about the tension that you find yourself in because it's really easy to point to where you were,
 less easy to point to where you're going,
 and I thought it would be fun for our audience to explore the tension of the now and the not yet.
 So where do you want to start with that story?
 Because like, why on earth would you give up a seat at the table of a major international ministry,
 which has rich history, rich value in revival culture, has birthed all of the major charismatic
 movements that are alive today. And you're leaving that to, and probably the question I was asking,
 what are you going to go to? And your answer is, I'm not sure yet. Where do you want to start?
 Yeah, I think that's a massive question. And it's funny how it dovetails in with what you
 you were saying earlier about just being in Franklin as Sarah's husband.
 I would say that same experience of, "Oh gosh, who am I without purpose?"
 Is the huge question mark over this whole season.
 So many of my relationships have been in the context of leader,
 et cetera, et cetera.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And so to now not have any of those titles to back up,
 the identity that God says about me is like shaky.
  </li><li>Does this work?
 Does this work without a business card?
  </li><li>So it's big.
 And I think it's well, with exploring,
 I'm not sure fun is the right word,
 but I'm really open to being vulnerable in the process
 because I think I know so many people
 that have in these last year or so
 find themselves in transition or in the brink of transition.
 So I don't think it's as rare as we think it might be.
  </li><li>No, it isn't.
 And I think your story especially,
 thank you for being a guinea pig to everybody else,
 learning from your story.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>How do you wanna begin the story?
  </li><li>Let's just, we'll cut to the punch line,
 which is that we are moving to the UK,
 where we're from in case you hadn't figured out our accents.
 But Sarah and I both independently moved to Canada.
 And so we've made the decision in the last six months following God's lead to move to the UK, but unto unknown.
 Yet to be determined.
 Right.
 And so it's very Abrahamic.
 The Lord basically came and said, "Leave your home and go to a place I'll tell you about."
 Yeah.
 And in this case, you know the place.
 Yeah.
 It's the UK.
 But to do what?
 Yeah.
 It has yet to be determined.
 Yeah.
 So you, it's quite your jobs.
 Mm hmm.
 Sold your house.
 Yeah.
 Put everything you own in a shipping cargo.
 Yeah.
 Big thing.
 And now we're in the middle of, like a vacation.
 Well, vacation.
 And you are chosen destinations.
 Yes, thank you.
 Along with Hawaii and California and some other places
 that we've been to.
 Yeah.
 But in a few short weeks, you'll be landing
 on the shores of England.
 Yeah.
 To do something that you don't yet know.
 Yeah.
 Like literally, there's no job.
 waiting for you. No, there isn't a house waiting for you. No, there's just you, Sarah, all your
 belongings, your three beautiful daughters, and a word from God. And I think, yeah, and I think
 the word from God is of course the thing that holds it all together, like at least in theory.
 And in practice, there is safety and security in that word, but even, like even as Ellen and I
 I would talk at this afternoon, we were chatting,
 and I just suddenly get like,
 fear, fear unknown.
  </li><li>Whoa!
  </li><li>I know, like starting to panic, you know,
 I'm flinging out job applications
 and not necessarily sure, is this right?
 I'm just like, let's just see what's gonna happen.
 And yeah, all of that is scary.
 And I think we've done it very much
 from a place of obedience.
 I think what's been remarkable about this journey,
 which I'll elaborate on in a minute,
 but is that we both together really felt like we heard God very clearly say,
 would you go to England? It wasn't a command. It was invitation.
 But we've learned individually and together that saying yes to him is always
 rewarding. And knowing you guys as we do, I also know that in your history with
 the Lord and history in our friendship, I've known that return to England hasn't been
 your number one preference. It isn't like, "Oh, I love Canada, but oh, I miss fish and
 chips and old Blighty." You've talked about your own desires to do other things and along
 comes this invitation from the Lord to say, "Hey, would you do this?" I want you to tell
 the story. I want you to tell it because it's so beautiful and rich and we've together
 all the things I love about you and the culture that you represent.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Well, I mean, we, I would say we found ourselves giving opportunity to serve in loads of different
 arenas in the church and the movement.
 And like you've, you've had many episodes talking about John O'Carroll and the rich,
 rich heritage.
 You've had Steve on here and Steven Sandra and we've worked very closely with them over
 the last five or six years.
 So we've had lots of opportunity to serve in something that feels like it has eternal value and purpose.
 And not only that, but there was certainly suggestion that if our role was to continue, it would grow in influence.
 There was scope for growth.
 And I know lots of people sometimes feel that kind of sense of sealing, and they're like, "There's nowhere for me here.
 me here, I'm going to go. That wasn't the case for that at all.
 No, not at all. And so I think our leaving feels even more dramatic, perhaps to our community
 and the leaders around us when there was that kind of hope and idea of perhaps us taking on
 even bigger roles. It certainly came out of their field for people who weren't walking in your food
 steps. Yeah. It was interesting. Hindsight's really easy to look at things clearly through,
 obviously. But I looked back at this past year or so. And the Lord often speaks to me around
 significant calendar events, my birthday, new years. And I woke up on January 1st 2021,
 just over a year ago. And I felt like so much of my grace for my job and my role had sort of gone.
 And at first I interpreted that through a lens of internal distress.
  </li><li>It's just happened. - Right.
  </li><li>Is it stressed? - Right. Did I eat too much turkey of a Christmas and now I'm just not engaged
 anymore. Like I just couldn't figure it out. And I think over time, I've really started just
 just seeking the Lord, like what is going on?
 And he started to then prod us on transition,
 that it was going to be happening.
 We'd already felt like some of the roles
 that were being talked about for us
 were actually not really what the Lord had on the table for us.
 We were like blown away by the,
 I can't really say offer,
 but by even being considered the conversations.
  </li><li>Yeah, but we kind of were like,
 this doesn't feel like what God's asking us to do.
 So what is it?
 So then we wake up January 2021 with this sense of transition.
 And even today I was looking back over some of my journaling
 just to reflect and just saw, yeah,
 like he kept on dropping these little, these little hints,
 like I've been saying, oh, before we sell the house,
 I wanna get this thing done.
 And in February 21, he was like, hey,
 big idea things don't get those things done.
 So those hints were there.
 Then we, because of COVID and everyone's working remotely,
 in the summertime we decided, you know what?
 The kids are out of school, they're doing school remote,
 I'm working remote, why don't we just take an extended trip
 to go and see some family in the UK?
 So we asked Stephen Sandra, who are our bosses,
 and they said, yeah, of course, take it, 10 weeks,
 I'll be working for half of it,
 vacation for the other half, what an amazing treat.
 Now, Sarah and I have an ongoing joke slash tension,
 which is that I am always thinking,
 "What's next? What's next? What's next?"
 And she is always thinking, "What's now? What's now? What's now?"
  </li><li>Right.
 And so, four, I'd even said anything.
 She was like, "Look, if we're going on this trip
 for 10 weeks, I am not talking about moving."
 (laughing)
 And I was like, "What do you mean?"
 what will I do? What will my mind do? I mean, I'm the kind of person that if we went on a mission
 trip to Antarctica, I'd be like, what would it be like to like set up life in Antarctica? You know,
 I just start to think that way. And she was like, I just don't want to talk about it. And I was like,
 uh, can I think about it? She was like, you're allowed to think about it, but you're not allowed
 to talk about it. And I thought, that's fair. That's fair. So let's not talk about it. Two weeks
 into our trip while we're there. I'm working remotely. She's teaching the kids and doing all of that
 out of the blue. We got a job offer, which essentially turned out to be two job offers
 on the same day. They were scheduled to happen on the same day.
 And we were like, "How were the blue unsolicited?" Yeah. And one of them was in North America,
 and one of them was in Europe. And so we seriously plans. Totally. I actually did have to say to
 Can we talk about it now?
 Cause I didn't will this.
 So that was a mega curveball for us.
 We, I mean, I say curveball.
 Obviously, like I said, we had this kind of sense of transition, but no,
 right understanding of what that meant.
 So it caused us to really go, whoa, Lord, what are you saying?
 And one of the things that I found so interesting in that season was that I was
 My immediate reaction was to outsource decision making to spiritual people around me.
 And what I was so tempted to do was to email all the prophetic friends and prophets that
 we know of, some significant name prophets even that we've been able to build relationship
 with over the years and be like, "Hey, this is a situation.
 What's the Lord saying?"
 And I'm just going to go with whatever you say.
 And whenever I started to follow through with that temptation, I really felt the father say,
 "Hang on, I'd actually really like you to not do that yet."
 And now, I just want to establish, we really believe in seeking wise counsel in our life
 and seeking prophetic input and looking for that kind of confirmation in witnesses.
 I think that's one of the wisest things you can do.
 but I could tell in this scenario,
 the law was trying to get to my heart of,
 hey, what's in your heart?
 What am I saying to you?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And then let that be confirmed, exactly.
  </li><li>Right, and you were trying to,
 one, two, Mr. Few, 99, what's the word of the law?
  </li><li>Yeah, what's the punchline?
 And then I'll just action it and we'll just do it
 and that's that.
  </li><li>You know.
  </li><li>Which I guess would probably be my inclination.
 I'm an action or interperson.
 And so we spent a month really just praying, wrestling,
 like trying to just feel even,
 just how would it feel to live in place A?
 How would it feel to live in place B?
 How would it, you know, all of that pause for a second.
 'Cause the irony that Sarah must have been her prophetic gift
 is like, hey, we're gonna vacation.
 I don't want you to stir anything up.
 I just wanna enjoy time with my family, time with kids.
 You know, I do not wanna think about the future.
 (laughing)
 And then the Lord's like, is that so?
 So it would continue.
  </li><li>We were kind of, we were furious, honestly.
 Like, even I was furious.
 'Cause so we had two weeks in Ibiza,
 which is this beautiful island off of Spain scheduled.
 And I'm like, great.
 Now I'm gonna spend the next two weeks in distress
 because all I'm thinking about is where we spend
 the rest of our life rather than being able to be present
 and relaxed in the moment, you know?
 And yes, even that had to kind of bring,
 I had to actually be willing to bring that to the father
 be like, why are you doing this? Why multiple options? Why, you know, all of that? And it
 was interesting because as we spent time just with our own hearts and talking to the Lord
 about it, we didn't feel any peace about any of these opportunities later on. Which was
 kind of startling because one of them in particular was a place that we really wanted to be.
 Right. Like on paper, it was like, "Oh, this checks boxes."
 Oh, yeah. And there was security in it. There's finances and process and titles,
 and we could afford a house and all of those things. So in terms of being a responsible father
 and moving my family, this is like, "Hmm."
 That both of these things, they looked very appealing. They gave us security.
 Yeah. And they meet the need of the itching that you're feeling as promised by the Lord.
 like any transitions coming. So it was disconcerting to not feel peace about it.
 So the time came to give a response and we felt like, actually we need to say no to this.
 And it was interesting because as we said no to these opportunities that provided
 security and perhaps a level of lifestyle that we were hoping for in America and different things
 things like that, we then began to feel a hunger rise up in us of our, you know, that
 was, it feels like your own hunger. It feels like a desire. And that desire was for the
 land of England. Of course, we're there at the time, but there was something about the
 land of England that just felt like, Oh, there's inheritance here for us. And that feels like
 like such a weird Christian vague thing to say.
  </li><li>I hear what you're saying,
 but also again, like what I alluded to earlier,
 like knowing you guys, you both laughed England
 to come to Toronto.
 And it's not that you had anything against England.
 I mean, you both love England,
 you'd love, you'd vacation there,
 but your heart were very much not in England
 for a foreseeable future.
 So it was really noteworthy and curious
 that that thing was rising up for you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, I agree and I think that's worthwhile saying,
 we had no intention of going to England.
 Yeah.
 So that was curious for us to go,
 "Oh, there's a hunger here.
 There's some kind of spiritual connection here
 in terms of what the Lord's created us for
 that doesn't feel like it's gonna be satisfied elsewhere."
  </li><li>Do you ever encounter that before?
 'Cause you're describing it as an old thing,
 but it was a very new feeling.
 legacy, history, connection, are all like backward historical terms, but you're
 describing it as something new. Yeah, that's interesting. I'm just wondering if that ever
 sources before? I don't know. I'd certainly never made the connection with England.
 I felt feelings of purpose, feelings of destiny. I remember I've had people in
 those years in Toronto, people say to me, you know, what do you really feel you're
 called to do? You know, I was like, I'm in, I genuinely believe I am in the will of God.
 Right. So I'm not looking for anything else.
 Right now is, is my calling for now? It may be that there's other assignments. In fact,
 I hope there are because I like new things. But right now, I know I'm in the calling of
 God. I'm in that destiny place.
 If we pause here for a second, if we use your life as an object lesson for our listeners,
 you think about so many times in scripture, where good turns out to be the worst enemy
 of the best.
 I think about the tribes of Israel, promised to promise land, rescued out of Egypt, 40
 years in the desert, they're getting to the promised land.
 One of the tribes is like, "We're good.
 We're going to camp on this side of the Jordan."
 is like, what are you, it literally right there.
 It's so close.
 And so I'm thinking about, you know, they had a prophetic word.
 They had a promise that they could see and they opted out of it for, for whatever
 reason. And I'm thinking about the parallel in your life that you wake up
 with an itch from the Lord about transition, about moving.
 And you get two glorious, rich opportunities.
 How easy would it have been to say, oh, this is a Lord, you know, or
 and be tempted by what they're offering.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And how crazy at times it can feel to say no
 to the very thing that it feels like God was speaking about.
 That makes sense?
 Like, hey, Ben, Sarah, January, transition's happening.
 And then whenever it was, June, here's transition.
 And the weirdness of turning that down.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And am I right in thinking that it was only
 when you turned it down that you began to have the next thing?
  </li><li>Yeah, I think so.
  </li><li>Isn't that curious?
 I think, yeah, I think, I love what you're saying.
 It's reminding me of another kind of component
 to the feeling I had, which I want to be sensitive
 in how I talk about this because it could get misunderstood.
 But as I came in touch with the realization
 that there wasn't peace to pursue these opportunities,
 I then found myself not necessarily overcome with peace,
 but actually overcome with fear,
 essentially a dread of returning to Toronto.
 Now, if you're one of my friends in Toronto,
 please don't interpret that as dread to be near you,
 'cause actually I felt deep, deep love.
 So this was also startling for me.
 I was like, hang on, I've closed the doors,
 and now I'm terrified.
 Right.
 That means I have to go back, but I wanted to go back.
 In fact, at the beginning of this trip,
 I wanted to be back.
 Yeah. So what's happened?
 So something in the process of closing door A and door B,
 the original place also felt like a no.
 And that was a strange feeling,
 'cause in many ways it felt,
 we felt kind of homeless, you know?
 And I was like,
 "Oh, I'm now so hungry for transition.
 I know, in fact, in my spirit that that is what God is doing.
 He is like he has awoken something in us for transition."
 And so then I was like, "Oh, I'm on the move."
 I would honestly say from that moment when I said, "No, I've felt homeless."
 It is interesting that the Lord presented you those opportunities when you're geographically
 removed from Toronto.
 there's something about that.
 Like it was Elijah where, you know, he goes to seek the Lord.
 And so he leaves where he's at because the Lord says, go here and I'll speak to you.
 And then he, I'm like, but you're speaking to me now.
 Like, like, and then he had to go there to hear the word of the Lord and I had to go
 somewhere completely different.
 And so you actually had to leave.
 And it was only when you left.
 I think a beautiful as we reflect on that.
 And it's natural.
 I think lots of people have sort of jumped to the conclusion that, oh, it's probably
 just really nice for you to be close to family.
 Right.
 And that has been challenging to process
 because it doesn't feel like it does justice to the cost.
 To the cost of moving there, which is enormous.
 Like our girls actually don't,
 our daughters, we have three little girls,
 they don't consider themselves British.
 They consider themselves Canadian.
 So this is moving to a new land.
 Sarah's lived there in Canada
 for more than she ever lived in England.
 there's such cost involved in it.
 It also doesn't feel like it does justice
 to the fact that we have lived away from family
 and paid that cost, which certainly there is a cost involved
 for 14 or 15 years.
 Yeah.
 And would do it again if that's what the father
 was asking us to do.
 Right.
 Well, it also cheapens the whole process
 that the Lord hooked your heart
 and was pulling you over here to make it sound like it was a very good earthly response.
 Like, "I want to be near my family.
 I'm wrong with that."
 That's just not what that is.
 Okay.
 So you've turned on your job, quick recap.
 You now realize I feel homeless.
 I know I'm going to be returning to Toronto, but what was an itch in January is now an
 ache.
 Like, "Lord, what are you saying?"
 Yeah.
 And you're feeling like this thing to England.
 So in that moment, we then felt kind of a permission from the Holy Spirit to seek out
 some prophetic input.
 Can I ask you a question about that?
 Please.
 One of the things that drives me nuts in contemporary Christianity is that the way people get confirmation
 is rather than calling a prophet and saying, "Hey, I'm just curious.
 Would you inquire on the Lord on behalf of me?"
 saying, "Hey, I felt a lot say this, this, this and this. Do you agree?" And so which
 one did you do? Well, you'll be pleased to hear Mr. Jones that we did it the correct
 word by your standards. I mean, you've passed people. No, I totally agree. I totally know
 what you mean. So, someone's like, "Hey, by the way, I'm quitting my job. That feels
 good in the spirit, right? That's good." Yeah. Yeah. And you're good with that. I'm like,
 Well, sorry, what freedom is there, like,
 to really speak into that?
 And are you actually even prepared for me
 to bring anything other than what you believe?
  </li><li>So you just called all your profit friends
 and just said, hey, just curious as to your thing.
  </li><li>I think we wrote to five people
 who have been seasoned and faithful
 and reliable prophetic voices to us personally
 and to our ministry.
 I wrote to them a one-line email that was,
 I don't frequently do this,
 But Sarah and I have found ourselves
 presented with some opportunities
 and would love to hear what you feel the Lord is saying
 to us in this season.
 So completely open ended, nothing about England,
 nothing in Belgium.
 It could be a Bitcoin investment.
 Yeah, could be a puppy, who knows, right?
 And it was really interesting.
 We got responses from these people over the next week or so
 and all of them said transition.
 It's time to leave Toronto, it's time to leave Canada.
 And so that was a, okay, well, at least the ache
 and kind of the sense in our spirits
 and everything that we feel is echoed.
 There's still some vagueity about where next.
 Then we heard from a final,
 and I feel like the way the Lord often speaks to me at least
 is there's like puzzle pieces,
 and then suddenly you get something
 that kind of unlocks the whole thing
 and you go, oh, there's a thread
 that's running through all of this.
 We then had a couple of prophets that communicated with us
 and just said, "We feel like the Lord's asking,
 would you move to England?"
 And we were like, "Okay, that's what our spirit was saying."
 Yes, too, you know?
 Well, maybe it hadn't said yes, yeah.
 Our spirit was saying, "Oh gosh, is that really
 what you're asking?"
 And we were coming in terms in touch with the excitement
 and the cost and the, "Is this God?
 Is this us?"
  </li><li>What does this mean?
  </li><li>How much will this cost?
  </li><li>Remifications, huge.
  </li><li>Yep, yeah.
 And unto what?
 And I think honestly, some of my biggest fear
 in all of this is like unto,
  </li><li>'Cause as of today, you don't have a what?
  </li><li>No, I don't.
  </li><li>And what's curious, and we don't have to go into this,
 just out of honor for your journey,
 but we were talking earlier today,
 and you've got more not to do than you have what to do,
 which is curious, right?
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And I think it's so kind of the Lord just to say,
 it's not gonna be this, it's not gonna be this,
 which I also think is invitation dream.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it?
 I find a completely blank canvas
 can sometimes feel overwhelming,
 but some parameters feels like,
 huh, okay, I've got something to work with here.
 And so yeah, there's been some parameters in there,
 like we felt the Lord say that we're not supposed
 to be planting a church,
 at least not in this immediate season,
 with very open hearted and minded
 that that may be something he asks us to do down the road,
 but that's not now.
 Which I think would be the, I don't mean lazy,
 it would be the most natural conclusion
 for people to come to.
 Like, oh, you just spearheaded hugely successful churches
 and church plants and, you know,
 oh, there'd be no brainer,
 that's what you'll be doing, right?
 Like it fits a narrative, it fits an obvious thing.
 And it's so curious that the Lord just took that off the table for you.
 Yeah.
 That's really helpful because like you say, it's the natural thing.
 Yeah, there's almost some peer pressure there too.
 Oh, you guys, you could plan a great church.
 You know, I've noticed this city that doesn't have a great church.
 And I mean, it's a great city.
 You guys could.
 But then we're back to the difference between good and best,
 the difference between a good idea and a God's purpose.
 Yeah.
 And honestly, in our whole journey,
 just kind of looking at our future with the father,
 that's been a big tension of there's lots of like,
 lots of good ideas, lots of people have good ideas.
 I mean, I think if you are a gifted, mature believer
 who's young enough in age
 that you've got some, you know,
 potential in front of you,
 I feel like there's so many who will gather around you
 "Oh, you could do this, you could take over this church,
 you could lead this ministry, you could, you could, you could."
 That feels a bit suffocating.
 If actually it can feel lovely at times,
 there are days when I go, "Oh yeah,
 I could do any of these things."
 Through Christ, you strengthens me, of course.
 And it feels so nice.
 And then there are other days where you're like,
 "Ah, just leave me alone, please,
 just give me a moment to hear the Father for myself."
 So what are you, I mean, so like,
 I think the thing I love about you and Sarah
 is you've pushed all your poker chips
 to the center of the table.
 Like you haven't waited on confirmation.
 What I mean is like you haven't waited on,
 well tell me where I'm going before I go.
 You're literally like Abraham,
 you've left your people and you're going to a place.
 I mean, you know the place, but you don't know the purpose.
 You literally don't know where you're going to live
 or what you're going to do.
 What are you doing that tension?
 like what are you doing without tension?
 And secondly, what is the tension for you?
  </li><li>I think it's worth noting that the way that Sarah
 and I would process change is quite different.
 And like we were saying about me moving,
 I would be inclined to look forward,
 think what's next, what potential is there.
 Oh, we could do this.
 I could bootstrap a business that does this.
 I could sell mangoes on the side of the road.
  </li><li>Let's innovate, innovate, innovate.
  </li><li>Yeah, like all the time, just like, yeah, yeah, cool.
 We could plant a church in this suburb
 and I could get a job here and another job here
 and you could do night school
 and I tend to think that way.
 Sarah is like, unless the Lord is speaking,
 I'm not doing it, you know?
 So over the years, I've actually had a fear of,
 well, what if I feel like we're supposed to move
 and it's a bit of a boy cry wolf scenario
 because I'm constantly talking about doing something new
 and she doesn't want to, and what if there's suddenly
 enormous tension in our marriage?
 And so one of our constant prayers has always just been
 like, "Father, when it's you, let it be unmistakably you
 for both of us."
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>And-- - Check.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And so this transition, I mean, like Sarah,
 who would be more on the risk of verse end,
 I'm not saying she doesn't want to risk
 'cause she clearly has.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But she's more on the end of the spectrum.
 She is like, we have heard God and we're in and that's it.
 So I would say what's been quite beautiful
 is there actually hasn't been much tension
 between us in terms of is this the right thing or not?
 We genuinely believe we've heard God.
 We sort out all the confirmation we need.
  </li><li>I agree and I feel that.
 Like it's the right thing.
 I'm curious what you do with the people who are like,
 what is the thing?
 (laughs)
 Oh yeah.
 What do you do with that?
 like, how do you give an answer when there is no answer to people who need an answer?
 Yeah. I feel more of a need to present some kind of answer, some kind of confidence.
 Yeah, well, you know, of course I'm going to do this and this and it's going to be
 marvelous and just you wait and see. And if you want to invest, feel free. You know,
 that's the desire in me is to be able to put something confident forward. I think Sarah
 feels way more like, well, God's told us to move and he's going to tell us, you know,
 the next thing. I'm so appreciative of that.
 The interesting thing is that people are naturally curious, like people who love you, people
 who know you, people who care about you are going to wrestle potentially with the story.
 We all want to make sense. We all want to make meaning out of events. So it's like,
 hey, so you just quit a really good job with security and you sold everything you have
 you're obeying the Lord, but you don't know what the Lord is actually asking you to do.
 That you must have some sort of sense of their
 tension or their distress in not knowing. How do you meet other people's distress,
 or do you even try and meet a response to their distress?
 Yeah, I think when that happens, I'm often just as aware of my own distress, probably more aware
 of my own distress than theirs. And I wouldn't say I live in distress.
 And I was going to ask, what is the distress that you get in touch with?
 Yeah, I think well, that feels very fresh because earlier today you you just
 started asking curious questions about also what you're going to do, you know,
 and it wasn't long before I felt an awful lot of fear.
 Yeah. And as I've kind of managed to get a bit of time and process that with the Lord
 and just, you know, just even just processed my heart and spilled it out a little bit.
 I realize I think I feel more fear about possibly missing it, like trying to make something happen,
 trying to wait upon the Lord. Am I over-engineering something? Am I being too idle? Has he given
 me enough to work with and I just need to make something happen now? You know, I think that's where
 I get caught. Over the last year or so, I think my understanding of the will of God has been
 going through a radical shift.
 I bet it's been broadened.
 Do you know what it actually has? So I think in many ways, I now feel like the will of
 God is a much broader meadow, where before it felt more tight, right? Tight rope, like,
 I think I'm going to be exploring this for the rest of my life, but I've certainly recognised
 in this journey, there has been actually a lot of choice that the Father's given us.
 I think the thing that's been interesting for me is realising that the will of God feels
 way more complex than I'd previously realised.
 And so over the last year, my hope perspective on that has been shifting and changing loads,
 and it feels broader and wider than ever before.
 I feel like the Lord has actually given us a lot of choice.
 Yeah.
 There was, I genuinely believe there was freedom to choose to stay in Toronto.
 Right.
 And there was freedom to say yes to these job offers that we received.
 And in some ways that's terrifying because I'm more of a binary person.
 When I was doing exams in school, I liked the exams where there was an answer, a fight
 night.
 Yeah.
 the things where it was just like, yeah, right about history.
  </li><li>It was like broad and topative.
  </li><li>Yep, you know, give me a maths question,
 give me a physics question.
 So I think I've spent most of my relationship with God
 looking for a, what do you want me to do Lord?
 So yes, sir, sort of response.
 And actually as I've grown in intimacy with him,
 obedience looks very different.
 And you know, I think about it with my kids.
 Do I want them to be obedient?
 Yeah. - Sure.
  </li><li>Do I want them to be intimate with me?
 Yeah.
 I think intimacy takes precedence over obedience really.
 And so as my relationship with God has grown
 through the struggle of this,
 through the struggle of making decisions,
 through the struggle of like,
 oh Lord, can't you just give us a clear black on my answer?
 I realized, oh, he's so values walking that journey
 closely, more than giving us black and white discussions.
 And yet in the midst of it,
 there are moments that feel quite black and white.
 Would you move to England?
 Yes.
 Oh gosh, oh gosh, now I'm thinking of all the consequences.
 Now I'm thinking of all the ramifications,
 but I know it's a yes,
 but I still need to continue to choose that yes,
 because I'm not gonna be a victim
 to God giving me a choice and me saying yes, I'm going to be powerful and embrace the consequences
 of it. And I think often we see in scripture, like you brought up Abraham, we see God's relationship
 with his people is much more about the connection than it is about a set of instructions. And I was
 thinking about Philip in Acts 8, where there's a revival going on in Samaria. And then the
 Lord's like, "Hey, go on to the desert road." And to what? Like he doesn't even say, "Go
 to this place." He's just like, "Go on to the desert road." And Philip's like, "Oh, okay."
 And then radical, the Ethiopian eunuch and the incredible revival that we can only imagine
 kind of ensued from there.
 But I think sometimes the Lord is really specific,
 but it's not the whole plan.
 Right.
 And I think I feel like that's where we are.
 And right now I feel like I'm saying that so confidently,
 but honestly four hours ago, I was like,
 (gasping)
 But I think that's part of the process, isn't it?
 And like the difference that got you from (gasping)
 to confidence is time spent in the Lord's presence.
 Exactly.
 And I think we can never go wrong
 when we strengthen ourselves in the Lord.
 You know, when we take steps side and go,
 I don't know, I don't know what I'm doing,
 but I do know who I'm obeying.
 Everything becomes a little simpler.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I think it was either you or Sarah
 who were talking about like, hey, you know,
 like in the midst of this turmoil,
 in the midst of this, not turmoil, but you know,
  </li><li>Upheaval.
  </li><li>Upheaval is a great word.
 You know, we dug out a lot of our prophetic words
 and we were amazed to see words that pointed
 to this season that we couldn't see when we got them.
 And there was one particular that really struck me as like,
 oh, shut your face, that's amazing.
 Can you share with our listeners that?
  </li><li>Yeah, so we are on this trip at the moment
 and we thought we wanna take a kind of a chapter break
 between these two chapters of our life.
 And so we were driving in California last week
 and we actually were on the road to Vegas, believe it or not.
 And we were like, okay, well, we've got some desert road,
 let's listen to some prophetic words.
 We listened to one from a number of years ago
 And this girl who was prophesying over us said,
 the Lord's gonna mark when it's time to transition
 because you'll start to receive job offers.
 And the Lord says, will you say no
 to the first two churches that offer you jobs?
  </li><li>Which made no sense in the moment that you got that word
 'cause nobody was offering you jobs.
  </li><li>Exactly.
 And so in that moment we were like, oh, okay, sure, yeah.
 All right.
 And we hadn't ever thought about it since.
 And now we listen to it this time in the middle of the transition and we go, "Let's
 run in the middle of a desert."
 Yeah, in the middle of a desert.
 And we said, "Oh, we did say no to those two offers."
 And it did initiate the transition.
 So I love the Lord.
 Kind of like the Lord.
 Kind of like the Lord is so previous, isn't he?
 He's like, "Let me speak this thing out that's going to help you with confirmation after
 you've done the thing I know you're going to do anyway because your heart is after me."
 Mm-hmm.
 fear of missing it is a present fear for me.
 Like, oh, wait, if the will of God is so wide,
 am I gonna go off the track?
 Am I gonna lose it?
 Or, you know, if it's narrow, am I gonna just fall off
 the track?
 If it's wide, am I gonna kind of drift in that track so much
 that I forget where I'm headed in the first place?
 But I think I have to keep reminding myself
 it's about walking it with the Father.
  </li><li>And if he was intent enough to speak to you,
 He's intent enough to continue to speaking to you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So you're in this season of life
 called time gap management, you know?
 Well, you know what God's called you to
 and you're walking out and you don't know quite
 what it's gonna look like?
 Probably more extreme than a lot of people's.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You know, you've said yes.
 How would our listeners who've resonated with your story
 find out how the story ends?
 Like where can people find more about your journey?
  </li><li>Well, yeah, I mean, because we don't know
 what we're gonna do yet,
 It's not like we have created anything.
 I very quickly made a Ben and Sarah.org
 as a, this could ultimately be the place
 where we tell the story of what we're doing.
 So at the moment, it's just a picture of us saying,
 we're moving to England.
 But at some point, there'll be more on there.
 So that would be one way.
  </li><li>You're on social media,
 can people follow you on Instagram?
  </li><li>Yeah, creative Ben is me and Sarah Dally Jackson is there.
  </li><li>I'll put those links in the show notes.
 I'm sure that as people who listen to this episode,
 they will find woven in your story,
 parts of their story they can resonate with.
 And I wondered if you would do something very generous
 that you would sow where you want to go,
 or you would pray for our listeners
 for the things you don't yet have that you want.
 That's one of the best ways I know
 about propelling your story forward.
 Yeah, so would you pray for our listen?
  </li><li>Yeah, I think the two biggest components
 that have been essential to us
 and as we look forward will be essential
 are faith and intimacy with the Lord
 to like hear him closely and to trust that when he speaks
 he's to just trust him, you know,
 to have faith to follow through in it,
 that he will follow through in there.
 So Father, I thank you for these listeners
 that are listening, that are watching,
 that are engaging with this moment Lord.
 I believe that you are orchestrating the most
 glorious and wonderful change project on the earth where you are moving your sons
 and daughters where you need them to be. And right now I speak a release of faith
 that gift of faith that is not us working up our muscles of faith but God
 is you releasing a gift of faith and impartation. What would you raise that
 up in every one of us? Raise up a gift of faith that we would be able to trust
 you that we will be able to hear your voice and take action to risk, to step out. Lord,
 you bless everyone with that gift to see far beyond where their natural perspective would
 take them, where their natural inclination would even allow them to go and to have that
 faith. And Lord, I ask for a greater intimacy than we have ever known. Lord, I ask for a
 generation, not I don't mean that in age bracket wise, but I mean a season of the church, the
 body of Christ that walks in such significant and beautiful intimacy with you, that they
 hear your footsteps, that they hear your words, that they are able to respond to the tiniest
 nuances of your voice and nudging and to walk their journeys and their callings out in the
 closest way possible to feel your breath, to feel the dust of your footsteps for them to be
 walking so closely. Lord, I know I need it. I ask that you do that for us, for Alan, for I,
 for our wives, our families, and for every one of these listeners that we would be able to walk in
 that gorgeous, wonderful intimacy of closeness with you, that in even the riskiest and scariest
 of moments in our journeys that we would feel you there with us and that we would have faith
 that you're going to lead us through. Amen. Amen. Benjamin Jackson, husband of Sarah Jackson.
 Thank you so much for being on our podcast this week. You're so welcome.
 I must say, darling, funny hair or not, you're a handsome man. Thank you. Yeah.
 Funny hair or not, you're a beautiful woman. Thanks. My hair is a little bit fuzzy today.
 You've got nothing on it. I've got a listening question. Oh, okay. From one of our members, Kurt.
 Hi, Kurt. Thank you for being a member. Kurt says this, "Hey, Ellen and AJ.
 Firstly, I am loving listening to your podcasts and grace in our sermons on finance at the moment
 and getting super excited about giving again. It is reawakening excitement about giving to God
 can't wait for your course. I have a question about blessing/offering in addition to your tithe
 and how it works for you practically. I'm wondering if you put the money aside in an account to see
 how the Holy Spirit leads you to bless people and keep money ready or if you just straightaway
 donate it all to charities or missions as per God's heart or maybe split in between the two.
 I like the idea of blessing directly each month but also love the idea of being ready and equipped
 to bless as people with needs are drawn by the Holy Spirit. Spirits? The Holy Spirit? Good Lord,
 what is wrong with me? How do we do it, baby? Well, so we, we actually put a certain percentage
 aside after our tithe to give away. And some of it is we always give to Israel and we always
 give to the poor and those go out right away. And then what's left is sitting in the account
 waiting and we're just waiting to see like what is, you know, who's the Holy Spirit talking to us
 about. Usually it's given away during that month, but occasionally it has been where it's still
 sitting there and, you know, month later there's something that comes up and we're like,
 "Yay, we have two months worth of stuff that's saved up."
 I also want to mention Kurt, and I'm going to talk about this on the course. I didn't talk about it
 in the last couple of weeks, but tithing is one component. Giving is another component,
 but there's a third component called giving that hurts. And that's when the Holy Spirit asks you
 you to give something that you didn't set aside money to give.
 And it's sacrificial giving, all of it's sacrificial.
 But like we just had, we were chatting to a friend
 and he was just sharing a testimony
 that he was getting ready for a major life move.
 And before he did the life move,
 the Lord asked him to give away all his savings.
 Now it wasn't savings to give away,
 it was his legit savings account.
 And the Lord was like, would you give all of that away?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so yeah, we try and live with like,
 Hey, Lord, we want to be open hands
 with everything you've given us.
  </li><li>Yeah, so we plan to give all of these different things,
 but then in addition to that,
 often the Lord will say,
 "Hey, I'd like you to give so-and-so this," or whatever.
 And that is unplanned like, wow, okay.
  </li><li>Wasn't planning on that.
 Are you sure about that?
 And that's where you like, breathe in.
 So I love your heart, Cora.
 I think it's great.
 And I think one of the things that I've had fun
 answering questions about both the podcast and the sermon series is the amount of flexibility,
 freedom and grace within how we approach our giving. I think tithing is really straightforward,
 but the giving thing, you can get super creative with the Holy Spirit about how you're going to do
 that. You heard Kurt talk about his excitement about a course that's coming up, and that is
 the more than enough course that's launching very, very soon. It's all about finances, stewardship,
 blessing, abundance, all that sort of good stuff. If you would like to learn about when the course
 launches. In fact, if you would like to be on the first round of invitations to the course, go to
 allen and AJ.com/more. And I'll add you to that list. You'll get an email when the course launches
 imminently. And you also heard us say that Kurt's a member. Kurt, thank you for your membership.
 That means Kurt got his question bumped to the front of the queue of the questions that people
 have sent in for our podcast. He also gets other benefits. Like he's going to get a discount on
 that course when it launches. He also gets to see the video, I get to see my messy hair,
 my wet shirt, all the good stuff like that. If you want to be smart like Kurt, you can
 go to <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/join to learn how to become a member too.
 It's all about your hair, baby. It's all about your hair.
 It means a haircut, let me tell you. Wow. AJ, if you don't want to ask questions or get
 show notes for this week's episode, where might they do that?
 So to alanahj.com/ask to ask us a question and alanahj.com/272 for the show notes from
 today's.
 Thanks for being with us today.
 We look forward to being back with you next week.
 Bye bye.
 Bye.
