<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Hey, dear Jones.
 Episode 259.
  </li><li>259.
  </li><li>Keeping up with the Joneses.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>A very special episode 'cause we have a guest speaker.
  </li><li>We do.
  </li><li>One of my favorite people in the planet.
  </li><li>Super excited about that.
  </li><li>Before we get to that, we could catch up.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Do you wanna even recap the past few?
  </li><li>I.
  </li><li>Oh, would you like to just forget that?
  </li><li>It's just, it's.
 But it's been a great week. No, it hasn't I was sick all week
 You were sick a week and I was doing all of the parenting and whatnot plus working
 So that's what was great. No, what was great was the conference was great. Okay. Well, I'm we're jumping ahead
 Let's focus on that. I was sick. Oh, you were my beloved. You were sick. You poor poor man
 Cuddled with my daughter and she had wet hair. So I was wondering why is my short?
 You do have a dance I was sick and I've been in bed for the past seven days six days
  </li><li>You were in bed for 10 days total.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>Yes, because Thursday was basically
 when you were like, "Peace out folks,"
 'cause we didn't record a podcast
 'cause you weren't feeling well.
  </li><li>That's right.
  </li><li>And you didn't get out of bed until Saturday.
  </li><li>Yep.
 I was negative for COVID three times.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>As negative for flu, negative for strap,
 but had kind of the symptoms of all those without fever.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And was just completely fatigued, was just in bed,
 was absolutely no use to anybody. Yeah. Was not fun for the congestion. Poor
 sweetie. But thank you for, big thank you to you for handling everything on the
 home front. Thank you. Big thank you to SOC staff and Grace and her staff who
 stepped in and took care of all the responsibilities that were mine this
 week. So thank you to all of our staff who helped me. I felt very loved by that.
 Good. But mostly by me. Oh, hugely by you. I mean for sure. Even though I didn't buy you
 You, right?
 You keep people you know how important right?
 Beena is to aid recovery.
 It is just sugar.
 None of it.
 Oh, no, you're right.
 You will have none of it.
 And I had.
 And it's probably why it took me 10 days to recover.
 Yeah, I could have taken you longer.
 Yeah, it was not fun.
 Before we jump into the conference, we just had that was amazing.
 Yes, which I miss half of because I was sick.
 Yes.
 But what were you doing this week?
 Well, I was at home and bed.
 You were.
 Well, so, you know, in addition to doing all the parenting, you mean, at work, I taught on year two,
 before lunch on Monday, year one after lunch on Monday, then year one before lunch on Tuesday,
 after lunch as well for one session, then I taught year two online on a completely different topic.
 So I taught three different weeks of the school and then all the normal meetings and stuff.
 So it was...
 A whirlwind.
 A whirlwind week going into a conference.
 And honestly, I was feeling pretty trashed going in, pretty exhausted.
 I mean, not to...
 Not this year, mostly because it's also been a week of me doing everything else.
 But I actually, I mean, I'm tired.
 I'm looking forward to going to bed.
 But the conference was great.
  </li><li>Conference was amazing.
 Is our annual Heaven declares conference.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And we had Bishop Joseph Garlandon.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Who's our first time having him here at Grace Center.
  </li><li>Gosh, I love him so much.
  </li><li>Had him several times in Toronto.
  </li><li>And I'd never met his wife before.
  </li><li>Barbara.
  </li><li>And she is amazing.
  </li><li>Yeah, Miss Barbara.
 She has amazing.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>And then we had Lafe Hetland.
 who's been here many times at Grace and I was teaching
 at the school this week.
 And it was a real joy and a big shout out
 to our worship team who just crushed it.
 They were serving.
  </li><li>Oh, every session, so good.
  </li><li>And then serving more.
 And I was like, I don't know how Josh Parsons
 is still upright.
  </li><li>Well, we don't know that he is at this point.
 He might be already in bed.
 He might have gone to bed at six with his toddlers
 or something.
 But yeah, it was quite the weekend.
 It was great.
 We sprit did lots of fun stuff.
  </li><li>I also met, did you meet Andrew and Hannah?
  </li><li>I did from Peterborough.
 Well, he's from Peterborough.
  </li><li>From Canada.
  </li><li>Yes, Canada.
  </li><li>Yeah, from Canada.
 So yeah, I showed up on Saturday,
 I think which was the first day for me of the conference.
 And God bless these guys.
 Hello, by the way.
  </li><li>Hello.
  </li><li>Who come all the way from Canada to attend the conference.
  </li><li>Yeah, amazing.
  </li><li>And they're podcast listeners.
 So I wanted to say hi.
 Like, anybody who makes a--
  </li><li>Your baby, I wanted to steal Moses, the baby.
 I didn't.
  </li><li>I'm glad you didn't, baby,
 because I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
  </li><li>It is illegal, but he was so cute.
 Oh, just adorable.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So great, I'm glad the week is over.
 I don't wanna say it was a great week.
 I'm just glad the week was over.
  </li><li>I'm glad you are not sick anymore.
 And I don't think I have energy
 if the conference had gone in another couple of days,
 but it was wonderful.
 And I don't know.
 I'm expecting, I feel like stuff has happened
 that we're unaware of and I'm waiting to see
 what that looks like.
  </li><li>Life in the spirit, I love it.
  </li><li>Love it.
  </li><li>Our special guest this week.
  </li><li>Yes, Moleshir.
  </li><li>Steve Long.
  </li><li>Steve Long.
  </li><li>Who's been on our podcast before.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And is one of my favorite teachers, for sure.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I'm gonna hand over to you, who's gonna interview?
  </li><li>Well, Steve, welcome.
  </li><li>Thank you, good to be back.
  </li><li>Yes, it's great to have you.
 We're just trying to decide if you've done it twice before.
  </li><li>I think two, yeah.
 But I've done a few podcasts, so.
  </li><li>Yeah, well, I guess you were.
  </li><li>One or two.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
 I was talking to Abby today on the way to lunch
 and she was saying, "How long have you known Mr. Steve?"
 And I was like, "I think we've got to be
 "at about 25 years 'cause you came in 94, right?"
  </li><li>94 is when I joined the church,
 but I started attending and helping plan events in 93.
 92.
  </li><li>Okay. - Anyway, so yes,
 we're both getting old.
  </li><li>We're, yeah, so that's all we wanted to make sure everybody.
  </li><li>That was the value we were all attending.
  </li><li>And he's on his point.
 How old are you, Mom?
  </li><li>Old, getting up there.
 So so good to have you on this show.
 I think Alan was telling you,
 we've done a bunch of five things.
 So five things we didn't know about kids before we had them.
 Five things we didn't know about marriage.
 I'm trying to remember what else we did,
 but we've done a couple of different,
 five things we didn't know about ministry.
 And so we asked you what five things you wanted to talk about.
 My only request was that it wasn't your five best dad jokes
 because I'm pretty sure I've heard them.
 Maybe, you know.
  </li><li>I think there's hope that there's still good ones coming.
 (laughing)
 I steal for those of you who follow my dad jokes.
 I steal from three or four different websites.
  </li><li>Oh, you like, you researched them,
 like you're serious about this.
  </li><li>I know, serious plagiarism.
  </li><li>Okay, that's excellent.
  </li><li>Yeah, I admit that.
  </li><li>Yeah, the kids were like,
 I don't think we've ever had lunch with somebody
 who told us so many jokes at lunch.
 And I was like, yes, well, there you go.
 Now you, now we've done that.
 So, so what are we talking about today?
  </li><li>We're gonna talk about five things
 that I did not know about healing
 when I began to function in healing.
 Yeah. Oh, that sounds great.
 Yeah. Yeah. Perfect.
 So just start. Just start.
 Perfect. Number one.
 Number one, I think, is perhaps the simplest one is that it's God's will.
 I grew up in a tradition conservative evangelical where we believe that God
 could heal, but we were not convinced that God wanted us to ever pursue
 the healing of individuals.
 Okay.
 If that makes sense.
  </li><li>Right, so God could randomly do it.
  </li><li>Right, okay.
  </li><li>But it was very presumptuous of me
 to ask someone to pray for me for my healing
 because maybe that's not what God wants.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And it was very presumptive of me to go to someone to say,
 "Can I pray for your healing?"
 We just did not do that.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Because we were not convinced that it was God's will.
  </li><li>Right, so basically that's where we get those prayers,
 like, if it's your will.
 I remember that's how when I first got saved,
 'cause I was brought up heathen, and then got saved.
 But that was-- - I prefer the word pagan.
  </li><li>Pagan, that's fine too.
 I remember that's how people prayed was if.
 So there was always a question.
  </li><li>So I would say that after looking at the scriptures
 and reading the scriptures, primarily looking
 at the life of Jesus, because if Jesus replicates
 the will of Father God, he clearly did everything perfect.
  </li><li>Right. - So, what did Jesus say about it?
 And there is only one passage in all of the scripture
 where that question's asked.
 It's in Matthew chapter eight, verse one,
 where a leper comes and says, "Is it your will?"
 And Jesus, before he even answers the question,
 touches a leper, heals him, and then said,
 "Yeah, it's God's will." - Yeah.
 So the answer is given after he touches,
 probably hugs the guy, which is you just don't do that
 'cause that's a contagious disease.
 So that's the first recording of it,
 again, if you're going Matthew Mark Lucha on.
 So we don't know when that story took place
 in terms of all the sequence.
  </li><li>Sure, sure.
  </li><li>But it's the only passage where the question is asked,
 is it God's will?
 And it's an emphatic yes.
 But to me, the better passage is comes from the Lord's Prayer
 where Jesus is teaching his disciples,
 they've asked him, how do we pray?
 Okay, here's how you do it.
 Our father who's in heaven, holy is your name.
 Then it goes into your kingdom come,
 your will be done on earth just like it is in heaven.
 So now we're going, okay, well what happens in heaven?
 Well, exclusively what God wants.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Everybody is healed in heaven.
 The moment that they arrive, they're healed.
 Lots of things happen.
 the moment you get to heaven you're rich.
 But when you get to heaven you are healed,
 you are according to Revelation 20,
 no sickness, no disease, no mental health,
 no depression, nothing wrong, completely healed.
 But in the prayer of Jesus says
 that we're to be praying on earth just like it's in heaven.
 So if everyone arrives in heaven healed,
 that's gotta be the will of God for planted earth.
 Yeah, so good.
  </li><li>So when I began to sort of figure that one out,
 it was like, okay, so that means I'm not allowed to pray
 if it's your will, prayers anymore.
 In fact, I tease people in our prayer team at our church,
 if you're caught saying that,
 you get a warning second time you're off the team
 when it comes to healing, prayers.
 Because we want people to be praying prayers of faith.
 And we'll talk about that.
 I think that's number four.
  </li><li>Good.
  </li><li>Number three or four.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I'll look at the cheat sheet.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>I love that you made little notes.
 Alan makes little notes as well.
 I usually do too, but he's a good dude.
 We'll keep him.
 Number two, healing for everyone to do.
 It's a team sport.
 It's not an exclusive thing for just some to do.
 Two passages that come to mind.
 One is an Acts chapter three.
 Peter and John go into the temple courts.
 They see a man who is lame.
 I think it's 38 years.
 been consistently placed at that gate. If you go to modern day Jerusalem, every gate
 there's beggars. It's just like that's where people come in. And as they're walking in,
 they see this guy and their eyes are drawn to him, their intentions drawn to him. There
 is no stories of Peter and John or any of the other disciples healing anybody. There's
 no details to any of the stories. There is one passage when Jesus sent the 12 out and
 it's one verse when they came back said they healed the sick. That's it. No stories. And
 if we could say it, it was under a moral denointing because there's no other stories of this.
 And now potentially this is the first time in the book of Acts, first time it's recorded
 anyways, that they're going to be involved. They see a guy and they don't start with a
 They don't start with a shoulder injury.
 They start with a guy who's been lame for most of his life, if not all his life.
 And their response is, "Silver and Gold, we don't have because we're pastors."
 That's a joke.
 But what we do have and what they have, they don't know that they got it.
 I think that they're acting in a little bravado.
 I think they're hoping that they're anointed.
 Yeah. Because Jesus had breathed on them. They've had Acts chapter two where they've been filled
 a second time, those two guys specifically. Probably end of Acts chapter two when they pray
 for the 3,000 people that put their hands up and say we'd like to be born again. And part of the
 prayer was to be born again and filled with the Spirit. So I think probably they had a big mosh
 bit of like 3,000 people are all filled with the Holy Spirit. And a couple other times,
 appear that they're filled with the Holy Spirit.
 So I'm hoping that they were full of confidence,
 but knowing Peter, I think it was a little,
 okay, we're gonna just see if this works.
  </li><li>Right, right, right.
  </li><li>I'm reading into the story.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>Anyways, they say, "Silver and gold, we don't have,"
 but we do have something,
 and we're gonna try it out on you.
 And when this guy jumps to his feet,
 and the prayer, by the way, I love it,
 'cause Peter says the magic words be healed,
 Nothing happens.
 And then it says, Peter plan B is he reached out
 with his right hand and pulled the guy to his feet.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>He's still lame.
 And as he's pulling him to his feet,
 that's when the anointing kicks in.
 That's when the healing power kicks in
 and all of a sudden it's a boing and he's up and jumping.
 And a large crowd gathers and in Acts chapter three,
 verse 12, let me just turn there quick.
 This microphone is inconveniently right in front of my scriptures here.
 I often have trouble between that and whatever I'm trying to read.
 So Acts 3 verse 12 says, I'll start in verse 11.
 It says, "Well, the man held on to Peter and John.
 All the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon's
 Colonnate.
 saw this when he saw the people coming, he said, "Fellow Israelites, why does this surprise you?"
 Well, I think he's in bravado again. I think he's the biggest surprise. I think that's exactly it.
 It's like the first time that I healed someone out of a wheelchair,
 I was hoping, but I was very surprised that it happens. And I phoned John Arnett right away. I
 went into the back hallway while they're playing a worship song and got him on the phone. He's like,
 like, "John, we got a got a wheelchair."
 And it's like, "I'm all excited.
 I'm pumped."
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And it was like, "Yeah."
  </li><li>That reminds me of one of my favorite stories about you,
 which after you read this.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So he says, "Fellow Israelites, why does this surprise you?
 "Why do you stare at us as if by our own power
 "or godliness we made this man walk?"
 Peter's acknowledging he's not doing it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So if Peter's not doing it, who is doing it?
 And I would say it's the will of God.
 And if it's the will of God that everybody's well,
 then that means that somebody's got to do the healing
 because Jesus isn't around anymore
 and that somebody's followers are Jesus.
 And so it's now a team sport that everyone gets to do it.
 And then if you go to, I think it's Acts 11
 where it talks about the church in Antioch
 where people were first called Christians.
 So the word Christian is a nickname
 given by the people of Antioch, the pagans, the heathens, the non-Christians, the non-Jews even.
 And they name these people Christian, which means little anointed ones. And that's not what
 they were called in Jerusalem because in Jerusalem the church watched the disciples do the miracles.
 they watched the 12 do spectacular miracles, but there was no prayer team. They didn't release it
 to everyone else to, okay, turn to your neighbor pray for the person beside you. There's no record
 of that. Sure. The church just watched the apostles do spectacular stuff. But now when
 the persecution happens, Vaxate and people run, everyone who's running is seeing opportunities,
 practicing, doing it, and it begins to happen. Sure.
 And so that's how that church in Antioch started was at least two men from, I think it says Cyprus and Cyrene, places like that, unnamed people.
 And they start seeing Greeks, Gentiles, born again, started church, Barnabas is sent, and the end result Paul joins that church as an assistant pastor.
 And the end result is the people in the town called them anointed ones.
 How do you get that name?
 Doing anointed stuff, lots anointed stuff.
 Anointed stuff is stuff that people can't do.
 But God could do. Yeah. So healing would be one of those. Yeah.
 But what about your story? Well, I was just also thinking like when you're talking about that,
 what the example, me correct me if I'm wrong, the example we have in Jesus is that he didn't
 heal out of his divinity, but he healed out of his humanity and his partnership with the Holy
 Spirit, which is the same that that we have, of course. So that's pretty much what you're.
 AJ, don't steal point number five. Oh, no, I can't even read. I'll turn. Anyway,
 No, I was thinking about the story of I'm trying to remember where you were and I've heard,
 like I've heard you tell it and I've heard Alan retell it, but it was a healing meeting I think
 in the UK where you started the meeting by saying let's figure out who this sickest person in the
 room is. That would have been in Glasgow the first time that I met Alan. That's probably what it is
 and you said like we'll get them healed and then it's like all it's all gravy from here.
  </li><li>Exactly.
  </li><li>And I'm just like, well, that's real brave.
 Like.
  </li><li>Well, I've done that a few times.
 I only do it if I feel the Holy Spirit say to do it.
  </li><li>Of course.
  </li><li>And the code word for me is show and tell.
 If I hear the word show and tell, I know what that means.
 It's like, let's have them nominate someone.
 So I've done that several times.
 So in that particular story,
 I think they nominated someone Allen that was
 in a wheelchair, yeah.
  </li><li>And the person beside them, I had to do the ministry.
 And I have a little prayer that I learned
 that had them repeat.
 I think that's what I did.
 My healing belongs to me because what Jesus has done,
 I received my healing now.
 Okay, and the person stood and everyone clapped
 and from there on it's really, really easy.
 Yeah.
 Because everyone realized, and the point of that for me
 about show and tell if I can say it like that
 is that I'm trying to model that I don't want you
 coming to me to do your healing.
 If your friend, if the lady sitting beside her friend heals her.
 Yeah.
 Well, now she's going to be actively praying for people.
 Everyone else that's there going, well, that wasn't so hard.
 Steve didn't do anything there.
 All Steve did was just say, who's the worst in the room?
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, it sort of blows up the whole man of God mindset
 in terms of there's a select few.
 Yeah, I like to be needed.
 Sure, we all do.
 But here's the other truth.
 I don't like to be needed.
 Where at a church meeting, everyone lines up for me.
 Do you know how long that means I have to stay?
 Yeah.
 And if you don't really like people, that's a long time.
 Steve, you don't like people?
 No, no, I didn't try to convey that.
 I'm not a people person in the sense that that's not my first thought is.
 How are you feeling?
 That's not my first thought.
 My first thought is how is the church doing?
 Like I function more of as an apostle,
 so it's the entity that I care about
 rather than the individuals.
 My wife, Sandra, it's all about the individual.
 She's wonderful.
 Never about the plan.
 Yeah.
 So I'm trying to say that if you give the impression
 that you're the only one to do it,
 then you're gonna be doing it.
 You're gonna be the only one doing it.
 And you're gonna be tired at the end of every night.
 I'd like to go get home reasonably.
 You know, on time.
 Yeah.
 So I mean, that's the reason of what to mean.
 If you get everyone else doing the ministry,
 well, then you're home on time.
 There you go.
 Watch baseball game or whatever's going on.
 Or cook meat in your fancy oven.
 My fancy barbecue.
 Yeah.
 Already number three is all sicknesses can be healed.
 OK.
 Matthew chapter four, the very beginning of the ministry
 of Jesus, there's a passage that is a summary passage. I find Matthew an interesting writer
 because he's, he doesn't write chronologically. He groups most of the healing stories together.
 He groups most of the parable stories together. And he just sort of cuts and pastes stories
 together. And he has a summary. By the way, I think it's season two of the chosen. One of the early
 episodes, either season two or season three, it's all about Jesus healing in Syria. Okay. And it's a
 whole day. And most of the episode, you don't see Jesus at all. He's sitting underneath like a tent,
 like a canopy. And he's ministering to people. And there's this big long line. And so that whole
 episode for those of you who've seen the chosen is the disciples complaining about how long this day is and
 They're taking turns be security for Jesus and organizing the lines and everyone's being healed every single person's being healed
 And then the final thing is they sit around a campfire
 Complaining and they start picking on Matthew
 for his sins of the past being a tax collector etc and
 Jesus shows up at the end of the day
 They've all eaten they've all had their meal Jesus is still in the tent praying for the last person
 And he comes back and he's exhausted it shows the humanity of Jesus
 Skips the meal go straight to his bed and it was like one of the most powerful
 Episodes that I've seen and it's straight out of Matthew chapter 4 my verse
 23 Jesus went throughout Galilee teaching in their synagogues proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and
 And healing every disease and sickness is right in the scriptures every every single one
 Among the people knew spread about him all over Syria and people brought to him all who are ill with various diseases
 Those suffering severe pain the demon possessed those having seizures the paralyzed and he healed them
 Yeah emphasis on healed them all yeah
 so in that passage we have twice where
 It's explicitly said every sickness every disease
 So that's good news, isn't it for every single person because if the doctors have named your problem
 It can be healed. Yeah, and it's got even I understand that some sicknesses are new today new word today
 Like I don't know that AIDS was around in the time of Jesus right they had other life-killing diseases like leprosy and things like that
 But every disease that was known at the time of Jesus was healed which says that it's that it's easy for
 For Jesus to do and if it's really the will of God that's doing it
 Then it's God's will that every sickness is is healable. Yes
 Can we receive our healing? Well, that's another whole topic because not everyone wants to receive their healing
 not everyone knows how to receive their healing and that's more the
 The mystery of healing but on God's side God is never the problem. Yeah God wants every sickness
 Every disease healed right according to the scriptures
 So good all right keep going keep going number four faith faith. So faith is a big part
 So I did some study a
 few years ago
 I felt the Holy Spirit saying to understand how faith works and I decided okay get a writer book on this
 The best place for Steve Long to write a book is on a cruise ship. Oh
 Wait, I should try that darling. I think we need to go on a cruise ship. Well, here's the deal
 Here's what I find out for Canadians probably for Americans as well is that if you work on a project
 six hours a day on average
 You're able to write off your expenses
 All right, we're booking a cruise
 So the best cruise for me is a transatlantic
 where you can't get off the boat.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And transiclantics are typically five days
 of uninterrupted cruising.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So you may have islands that you're at before or after,
 but so I've done two transiclantics and 13 days each one,
 and it just happens that the books I wrote are 13 chapters.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Wait, let me do the math on that.
  </li><li>One a day.
 Anyway, so when I write a book, it's all revelatory.
 I don't read other people's stuff.
 I don't do research.
 It's, I want it to be new, fresh insights.
 Not that I'm not leaning in on things
 that I've already had before,
 but so I'm starting about faith.
 I feel that that's what I'm supposed to do.
 I feel it's supposed to be based on Matthew.
 And so I had already sort of gone through Matthew
 and looked at how many stories there are
 where faith is talked about
 and relating to breakthroughs.
 healings, miracles, whatever the topics would be.
 And I went to, I decided, you know what?
 I'm gonna start with Hebrews 11,
 that famous passage, but with faith looks like.
 And I'm trying to simplify faith,
 'cause that's partly what I try to do as a Bible teacher is,
 let's make this really easy
 that everyone can figure it out.
 Like the NIV translation which I'm reading from,
 I think is written at grade five level.
 something like that.
 I'm sorry, I need to stop for a second.
 Are you saying that you're preaching from the NIV
 or be allowed to do that?
 I think so, where we're not?
 I'm now preaching from the passion as well.
 Okay, but is that another topic?
 I thought you were an NASB guy.
 No, no, no, no, no, no.
 Haven't been occasionally New King James, New Living Bible.
 I basically stick with one.
 And the reason that I preach from the NIV,
 I asked our church family what translations you use.
 Yeah, and I had them put their hands up.
 NIV was the most common.
 And so it's like, okay, I'll preach from that.
  </li><li>That's great.
  </li><li>And usually for our church, I've got power points
 and I have the scripture up
 so people can follow along as well.
  </li><li>I know, I'm not saying this to make you feel good
 or anything, but you are one of my favorite speakers.
 The only person who beats you is the guy that I married.
 So. - And Alan has learned from the best,
 not for me, but he's learned from the Bible.
 He's a teacher, isn't he?
  </li><li>Yes, he is.
  </li><li>You married a teacher.
  </li><li>Yes, yes, yes.
  </li><li>So a good teacher is going to make complicated things simple.
 So I try to do that.
 So I'm trying to figure out what's my definition
 of faith gonna be.
 And I know people have all little acronyms
 of what faith means.
 Anyways, I felt the Lord say that it's acting on revelation.
 It's an action.
 I have to do something based on a God thought.
 If I just think about it, that's called hope.
 Hope never does a miracle.
 Helps like an appetizer, it's a teaser.
 But when I do something, then the breakthroughs can happen.
 And faith is that action word.
 It's the cross.
 This takes you over the line.
 And so so many of those passages in Matthew's gospel
 talk about faith.
 And the one that I wanted to refer to,
 My notes have just gone here.
 Here they are.
 They're back.
 Oops.
 Matthew chapter nine, verse 22,
 is this lady who is bleeding for 12 years.
 Yeah, remember her?
 It's just a terrible story of pain, agony.
 So she's having a menstrual period
 it would appear for 12 straight years.
 So she's gonna be low blood pressure.
 She's going to have all of the hormonal ups and downs
 that come with that.
 The Bible says she has spent all her money on doctors
 and doctors have not been able to help her.
 So she's gone from having some wealth to no wealth
 and still the problem and the Bible says it's getting worse.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>According to the book of Leviticus,
 any woman who's in her menstrual time is unclean.
 She's not allowed to have sex with her husband.
 So if she's married, this is 12 years of abstinence
 for both of them.
 anyone that she touches accidentally or in purpose is unclean, she's supposed to be isolated,
 all those terrible things.
 And then she has a God thought that she articulates.
 She says, the thought is, if I touch the hem of his garment, I will be healed.
 And then she hears that Jesus has come to Capernaum and she humbles herself and somehow
 gets on the ground it would appear because she touches the bottom of his
 trousers as it were, the hem of his garment. While there's a huge crowd and
 Jesus doesn't notice her. So you just have to sort of picture this but
 probably she's on her hands on her face crawling through people, not hanging on
 her hands. She's lying down probably crawling through, reaches through, touches
 Jesus in a big crowd, no one's particularly noticing her.
 And Bible says that Jesus felt the anointing leave his body,
 which by the way, for people who are administering
 is one of the little keys of when you know when
 to stop your prayers for people.
 If you feel the Holy Spirit has left you
 like you feel a power surge either up or down.
 Because sometimes when you're praying for people,
 you feel a drain on your body.
 Well, that would say someone's just received it.
 There's been a transfer.
  </li><li>Oh, that's really good, yeah.
  </li><li>And sometimes it's a power surge where it's like,
 ooh, you're up. - Yeah.
  </li><li>So either way, I've learned,
 I just, I can stop the praying right now.
 I can just say, check yourself.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And almost always they're healed.
 And if you're on stage in a church meeting
 in some sort of public place and you have that surge,
 it really makes you look good.
 (both laughing)
 And what others don't know is that you've just felt it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Just like Jesus automatically stops and said,
 "Who touched me?"
 Remember that?
 And Peter says, "Well, everyone's touching you."
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But Jesus, no, no, no, no, no.
 Someone just got healed.
 Something just, where are you?
 And as he keeps asking the question,
 "Where are you?"
 Finally a lady comes out, puts her hand up.
 And the Bible says that she's trembling.
 One passage says she's trembling for embarrassment.
 like she's a little conscious of that.
 I tend to feel that the reason she's trembling or shaking
 is that the power of God's still on her body
 and she's like, you know,
 (imitates
  </li><li>Right. - That kind of stuff.
  </li><li>Right. - Anyways, she tells her story.
 I heard God say, if I touch the hem of your garment,
 I will be healed.
 And what's Jesus' answer?
 Your faith healed you.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Not Jesus.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Her acting on a God's thought healed her.
 And we have that's consistently in the gospels.
 You have four buddies that have a friend who's lame
 and they hear that Jesus is in town in Capernaum.
 And their God thought is if we can get him to Jesus,
 it's simple.
 If we can get him to Jesus, he's healed.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's done.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>The problem with faith is that there's almost always
 a reason why your God thought doesn't make sense.
 And for these guys, when they get close to the house,
 the house is full.
 And if you've been to Capernaum,
 tiny little houses, - Tiny.
  </li><li>You can't get more than probably 10 people standing.
 And it's like a one-room house.
 And so they can't get in the house and the Bible says
 that the streets were packed.
 And if you've been to Capernaum,
 a street is maybe three feet wide.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You can't get a donkey down a street.
 Well, you can, but no one else is going down.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Like it's just really, really small.
 So they can't get close.
 And I love that about God's revelation.
 He's always wanting us to push through.
 And one of these guys has a secondary thought,
 which is, well, let's take them to the roof.
 So they do that.
 And if you remember as the roof was opening up,
 I'm sure that the meeting inside pauses.
  </li><li>I'm sure.
  </li><li>As they're watching and seeing what happens,
 I have a secondary thought just to let you know.
 I feel that this house belongs to Jesus.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Because if it was anyone else,
 I think there would be something in the texts
 about a temper tantrum.
  </li><li>Somebody freaking out about that roof.
  </li><li>Exactly.
 So Jesus would be the only one who wouldn't
 be overreacting. Right. Now, the scriptures don't tell the fullness of every story. Yes.
 But that's just Steve Long knowing that Jesus has a house somewhere in Capernaum. Yes.
 It refers to Jesus having housed three or four times in the scriptures in Capernaum.
 Mm hmm. Anyways, that's the side thing. Capernaum, by the way, is my favorite place. It's my
 My favorite place as well.
 I tell our team when we get there, we're going to have a five minute tour, like with our tour
 guide, we're going to oversee the architecture, we're going to go into Peter's house, where
 there's a beautiful Catholic church with a glass.
 Sitting on top, yeah.
 Floor so you can see Peter's house.
 And then we're going to go into the synagogue and on the ruins, the floor is the same floor
 that Jesus stood on. Yeah, 2000 years ago, the walls were rebuilt. Yeah, after Titus and
 80, 60, 80, think it was 69 destroyed it. But the foundation is the same. And I said,
 when we walk around, you tell people there's a team from Toronto that's visiting and they're
 going to do a healing meeting in five minutes and bring people from other tour groups over.
 and we always do a healing meeting publicly in that synagogue. We kick demons out of people.
 We do all the stuff. I love Capernaum. It's my favorite place
 to go to. Because there's history there.
 Anyways, back to the story of these, they opened the roof and then the Bible says that Jesus
 saw their faith, the faith of these four guys.
 And Jesus instinctively knew when he saw faith,
 when he saw action based on a God's thought,
 like who opens up a roof?
 Someone's had a thought.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>As simple as that is.
 Let's take them through the roof.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But it's God-inspired.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And if it's God-inspired, then that means
 God has a possibility for a miracle here.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So they do their part, and Jesus instinctively knew
 when he saw their faith, okay, I take over now.
 Yeah.
 And the mat's lowered down and he heals this guy
 by doing a forgiveness prayer is what he did.
 No prayer for healing, he just dealt with his issues.
 He'll forgive the guy.
 And I love that because if that's how faith works,
 that I get a God thought, I pursue to do what God's told me
 to do, even if there's obstacles.
 And usually the biggest one is your spouse,
 your best friends go, "Well, that's crazy.
 Why would you want to do that?"
 And the reason they say that is because they haven't had
 the God thought.
 And God's thoughts usually are outside of the realm
 of logic because it's supernatural, isn't it?
 It's God speaking and God's about to put aside science.
 He's about to put aside logic.
 He's about to put aside all of the norms
 because he wants to do something supernatural to show off.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>And I love that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 That's the principle for me is that if I act on God's thoughts
 and do what he said, Jesus is still watching,
 he's got a better view now from heaven.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>He's still watching and he knows, okay, it's my time.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's so good.
 I was thinking when you were talking about the woman
 with the issue of blood, it would have also been outside.
 Like you said, outside of what's socially appropriate
 because she was really to not touch anyone.
 Like there was so much wrong with what she did,
 but that wasn't what Jesus honed in on at all,
 none of that, but just the, hey,
 I felt something because of faith.
 I love that.
  </li><li>And in fact, he may have addressed that
 when he called her a daughter of Israel.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>'Cause that's almost like the Medal of Honor status.
 Like you're an esteemed person
 to be called the daughter of Israel.
  </li><li>Right, and she would have been ostracized for 12 years.
  </li><li>Absolutely, so.
 Everyone Capernaum, maybe not everyone in Capernaum.
 I think there's 75 excreted houses.
 So 75 men, 75 women, like mums and dads,
 I'm quite sure the mums know about her.
 Maybe not all the husbands.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>But you've got to figure in a tiny little town like that
 that most people know about her and probably the kids,
 if they see her, they're mocking her,
 they're teasing her.
 That's what that's what you do, isn't it?
 Yeah.
 And when you don't know the full story, if you don't ask the questions, you're just
 going to assume that she's a recluse, that there's something wrong with her.
 She's, she's demonized.
 She's mental health issues, you know, whatever those kind of things are.
 And for Jesus to call her a daughter of Israel, it's like he just put her right
 at the top again.
 Love that about Jesus.
 So amazing.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 All right.
 Number five.
 Are we?
 Yes.
 Okay.
 Number one is God's will.
 These are all things that I did not know when I started a healing ministry.
 Things that I've learned over the last few years.
 Always as well.
 God's will.
 Everyone's supposed to be able to do it.
 Everyone should try to minister to their friends, especially if you have a God thought.
 Number three, it's for all sicknesses.
 Number four, it's related to faith.
 And number five, healing is about the anointing.
 Okay.
 My absolute favorite passage is in Acts chapter 10, 37 and 38.
 And the story is of Peter has had a nap.
 And you remember that he has this God thought of animals
 that are unclean, that are drop down.
 I'm trying to talk to you.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Keep my head looking at my,
 keep a nose looking at the microphone
 and then look down for my scripture passage.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So Peter has a dream.
 And in the dream, it's these unclean animals
 the Lord says, "Get up and eat." And he's going, "No, no, no, no. I'm a good Jewish boy.
 This is, this food isn't kosher." And as he's thinking about that, there's a knock in the
 door. And it turns out that a Gentile delegation from Caesarea, which is what? 45 minute drive
 north of Tel Aviv? A good deal north. A good deal north. They've had a three day journey
 to find Peter, a word of knowledge that has come to a Roman centurion.
 As he's seeking God, God spoke to him and said, "Go find Peter," and he's at this particular house,
 at Simon the Tanner's house. Yes. A Tanner is a fancy word for a butcher
 who takes the skin off animals and makes clothing at him. This is a stinking house. Yes.
 smelly house. Yeah. When you go to
 droppa, have you been to
 droppa? Yes. Been to Simon's
 house? Yes. I just don't know
 that that's it. Really? Yes,
 because it's it's in like black
 magic marker written on the
 on the on the stone Simon the
 Tanner's house. So that wasn't
 wouldn't have been there
 originally. Yeah, maybe someone's
 happened to tourism. Anyways,
 it's it's a house. Yes. And it's
 They all look similar.
 They're all the same.
 They're all the same.
 All the same.
 Yeah, yeah.
 So it's like, who cares which house it is?
 I think that's good because if we knew absolutely some of these places, they become shrines and
 people start worshipping that.
 Worshiping the place rather than the Lord who did the miracle.
 Anyways, so in this story, Peter gets this revelation.
 Oh my goodness.
 The dream I've had isn't about food.
 about people that I see is unclean. So he's taken by the gravity of this word of knowledge
 that a non-Christian, a Roman officer has had, and he says, "Okay, let's do this." So they,
 I'm imagining another three-day walk, he gets to the home of this
 centurion, and he makes a big point of saying to them, "I've never ever been in a Gentile city."
 and Caesarea was a Roman occupied city that Herod the Great built.
 Yeah.
 And beautiful architecture of that city.
 Huge city.
 Huge, yeah.
 Compared to Capernaum, it's like New York City and in a little Hodunk somewhere.
 Is Hodunk a place?
 Yeah, sure.
 Probably.
 Well, there's a place in Arkansas called Toadsuck, so there might be a Hodunk.
 You never know.
 Anyways, a little town and a fairly big port city that Herod has built.
 It has all the Roman things like it has the chariot race place.
 I don't recall that place, but it's a fancy word for when they had the chariot races.
 And it's beautifully preserved because it's by sand, isn't it?
 So sand storms come and cover it and all that kind of stuff.
 So they're there and Peter makes a big point.
 I've never ever been in a Gentile city.
 And by the way, there's no Bible reference that Jesus ever went into says,
 or if it's a Gentile city, he would not have gone to it.
 So he Peter says, you know, I'm here and he has this incredible revelation
 that Jesus is Lord of all, not just Jews, but Lord of Gentiles as well.
 And he's like, he goes in and K. Okay, what, why am I here?
 And they say, well, you know, six days ago, we had this.
 the officer had this thought.
 And we want to know about Jesus.
 And I've learned that if people are inquisitive about Jesus,
 it's not an hour talk.
 The longer you go, the less they're gonna believe.
 So you give a short little presentation.
 And his short summary of the gospel.
 Acts chapter 10 verse 37,
 "You know what has happened throughout the province
 of Judea, beginning in Galilee
 after the baptism that John preached,
 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth
 with the Holy Spirit and power.
 And he went around doing good and healing all
 who were under the power of the devil
 because God was with him.
 So Peter's summary of the ministry of Jesus
 is that everyone was healed because of the anointing.
 So we've already talked about this,
 you raised it that Jesus is not healing people
 in his divinity, like Philippians 2 makes that very, very clear that he emptied himself
 of all his God powers and totally relied on revelation. So seven times in John's gospel,
 Jesus says things like, I can do nothing by myself. I can't. I can only do things that
 I see, only do things that I hear, and he adds another one, only do things that my spirits
 taught. And he actually has a fourth clue. And that's compassion.
 And other passages says he was feeling compassionate. So his
 emotions all stirred. So Jesus in John's gospel is clearly
 saying, I can't heal people. Just of me, I can't do it. But if I
 get a God thought, if I get a picture, if my spirit just sort of
 jumps up and goes now, or if emotions are stirred like feeling compassion.
 And that really is the thought when you look at someone and this thought comes
 to you, that's not right.
 That's what compassion is.
 When you, you get a God thought that a little child should not be in it, have a
 cast, a little child should not be in a wheelchair.
 And when you get that thought, that's called Bible calls that compassion.
 And Jesus was activated to do something knowing that God has just spoken to him.
 And he went out and ministered to people.
 And every single person that Jesus went to is healed.
 Every person that came to Jesus in the court into the scriptures is healed.
 Did he go to everybody?
 No.
 Did everyone come to him?
 No.
 But everyone that the spirit of God drew him to.
 He ministered.
 People were healed.
 Everyone that came to him with God plots.
 They were healed.
 And Peter's summary is that it happened because God annoyed to Jesus at his baptism.
 So the kingdom of God, the new rules of the kingdom of God,
 the sermons that Jesus preached, or sorry, the John the Baptist
 preach of get ready, the kingdom of God is, it's close.
 And Jesus first recorded sermon is the kingdom of God is here.
 It's arrived.
 Yes.
 And kingdom, kingdom day is celebrated in liturgical churches,
 Catholic churches, Episcopalian, as the first, sorry, the second
 weekend of January, I think it is, is the celebration of the baptism of Jesus.
 And that's when the kingdom of God started.
 Heaven opened, the spirit of God came down, God spoke, and Jesus was anointed.
 And all of a sudden from there on, every time God directs him, a miracle takes
 place, healing takes place.
 Right.
 So that tells me that if I could be anointed and be led by the spirit, that
 potentially the same things can happen.
 So here's the good news.
 I happen to have the same father that Jesus did.
 And he is able to communicate to me through thoughts,
 through pictures, through my spirit.
 Just I know things.
 I don't know why I know them, but I do know them.
 And compassion, I can have compassion.
 So I can be led by the spirit.
 I can hear the voice of God the very same way that Jesus did.
 And I'm clearly like Jesus in that I can't heal anybody
 unless God steps in.
 Right.
 So I have the same father.
 He speaks the same to me as he did to Jesus.
 And if I know that it is his will, which Jesus knew.
 Without question without question.
 Now Jesus had a head start because he originated and haven't
 and so he he did know the will of God unconditionally, never once
 wavered from it.
 So if I step in that anointing is going to be with me as well.
 Yeah. And that's how miracles take place today.
 That's how people are healed today.
 That's how spectacular things that defy logic,
 that defy science that confuse the medical profession.
 Yeah.
 Is because there's this incredible thing called the anointing,
 which is the supernatural power of God that can come on every single person.
 Yeah. So we can heal. It's amazing.
 It is amazing. I love it. One other little thing.
 This is a bonus.
 But perhaps one God thought helped me to jump from, say,
 maybe one of every three, four people to be healed to maybe 50%
 is in Matthew chapter eight, the story of another Romans
 in Chury and from Capernaum where I love this story because when
 you put all the stories together, the Jewish leaders come to
 Jesus and Capernaum and say, see that guy standing over there?
 He wants to talk to you.
 Well, he's the Roman centurion.
 He's clearly gonna be a uniform.
 Jesus, if he's living in Capernaum,
 knows that that's the police chief.
 He's the guy.
 He's keeping law and order here.
 And they said, this is the guy who paid for our synagogue
 to be built.
 And you've been there.
 It's a monstrous building.
 It's like a quarter of the size of the whole town.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Every single person whose male gets to go to the,
 actually women got to go to synagogues as well.
 So it's big enough that everyone gets to go to the synagogue.
  </li><li>Sure. - Temple just meant.
 But a synagogue, ladies can go as well.
 Anyways, he has a favorite to ask you.
 You should do what he wants.
  </li><li>'Cause he built our synagogue.
  </li><li>'Cause he built our synagogue.
  </li><li>He's a good guy.
  </li><li>Yeah, we like him.
  </li><li>Yeah, and that's a fascinating picture of this guy.
 He's not a mean-spirited guy.
 He cares about them.
 He's been assigned to this town.
 He's somehow got some wealth,
 And, you know, he gives it away.
 And so he comes to Jesus and he says,
 I have a servant, probably Jewish,
 probably a little boy, who is in terrible pain
 and is paralyzed.
 Nobody hires a kid like that.
 So this is an accident.
 Something's happened to this kid
 that he's now paralyzed, he's in pain.
 And while he's breathing between sentences,
 Jesus jumps in and says,
 like come to your house and heal him. Again, no question about the will of God on that one.
 Jesus knows if I go, he will be healed. Is that what you'd like? Everyone wants me to come.
 John chapter 2, an earlier story, is that Jesus has been on the other side of Galilee.
 He's been in the region of Kaina and the mayor of Capernaum has haunted him down a three-day walk.
 Wow, he's called the royal official.
 He's the guy who's the leading politician, if you want to say it like that.
 So the mayor's tracked Jesus down and said, "I have a son who needs your help.
 Like come back."
 And Jesus goes, "You know, you guys are always looking for miracles."
 "No, no, this is real.
 Come back.
 I need you to come back.
 I'm important.
 I'm the mayor."
 Yeah.
 And Jesus goes, "Go.
 He's healed."
 And the guy I believe, Jesus, starts walking.
 And you remember a servant of his, they meet halfway and your sons doing well.
 He's fine.
 Oh, when was that? You know, that compared notes, it's like, "Oh my goodness." That was exactly when Jesus said it.
 So, the history of Capernaum is that Jesus has already done some amazing stuff.
 But everyone's wanting Jesus to be the ones coming to their house and touching and all that kind of stuff.
 So, Jesus says to the Romans, "Do you want me to come and heal him?"
 No? Just give the word.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm. - Give the command.
 And then he says this,
 "For I myself am a man under authority."
 And that little phrase,
 he is the first person to figure out that Jesus
 isn't the healer. - Yeah.
  </li><li>When he says, "I myself am a man under authority,"
 he's saying of Jesus.
 "I know how this works.
 "I know how military commands work."
 Caesar says we're attacking Jerusalem.
 He says that to the generals.
 The generals gather together.
 Okay, what's the plan?
 They come up with a plan.
 The generals don't attack.
 They pass that on to the, you know,
 whos ever under them and it gets to the centurions
 and it gets to the guys that are gonna be doing that stuff.
 Doing the attack.
 And so chain of command is what this guy understands.
 And he has recognized in Jesus
 that Jesus is not the healer.
 Jesus is the midwife, he's the middle man.
 He is doing the will of God.
 He's the first guy to figure it out
 because everyone is clamoring for Jesus to come and touch them.
 For Jesus to do this, to Jesus to that.
 And this is the first guy to figure it out.
 And he says, no, you don't need to come, just give the command.
 At which Jesus pauses, turns around to his buddies
 and everyone else following him and says,
 did you just hear this?
 I've never found anyone with such great faith.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So he's had a God thought.
 Jesus is the middle man.
 God wants this.
 If Jesus gives the command, it's done.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So why do we need to go to the house?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Just say it now.
  </li><li>So good.
  </li><li>And Jesus is just astonished
 at the revelation of this guy
 and turns around and says, oh my goodness.
 It turns to the guy and says, go, it's done,
 just as you believed.
 And the kids healed instantly.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So to me, that was a big one,
 is that at best I'm a middleman.
 If God gives me instruction, gives me thoughts,
 gives me dreams, gives me compassion,
 any of those motivators.
 And now I'm bold enough.
 So now is the question,
 will I have courage, will I have boldness
 to step out to do it?
 And on a good day, I do.
 On a day when I'm tired, on a day when I'm feeling,
 I don't know what you'd say, like, not necessarily abuse,
 but just a little wounded, a little discouraged.
  </li><li>Discur, all those kinds of things.
 You know, it's like, ah, not today.
 Yeah, you step out and you do it.
 I'll tell one story before we finish.
 And we want to pray for everyone.
 Friday nights in Toronto for years and years and years
 has been a come holy spirit push in night.
 And for a number of years, Sandra and I led that meeting.
 We would have different ones of our pastors
 preach on Sundays,
 but Friday nights are night and Sandra and I would fast
 our evening meal.
 We would go into the prayer room
 and we had a big whiteboard,
 we'd write down any God's thoughts we had on the whiteboard.
 The prayer team knew to be as they're driving
 to the meeting to be writing, or not writing,
 but keeping any God's thoughts,
 when they got there they'd write things on the board.
 So we would have some spectacular Friday night meetings
 and usually healing is one of the big components
 Friday night. Yeah. And it wasn't uncommon for 10, 15 healings and one or two
 spectacular ones like broken bones or you know that kind of stuff that's that
 when you visit a doctor is not going to happen. Yeah. You're not gonna walk out
 of your doctor's office well. Yes. You're gonna walk out of your doctor's
 office with a prescription and hope but not walk out well. Right. And so that's
 happening on a Friday night. And often those meetings would be late. And now we're hungry
 because we haven't had an evening meal. And one day we're driving home with my son, John.
 I think he was in the bookstore or something like that, that night coffee shop. And we're
 driving home and we see a subway restaurant, sandwich shop that's open. It's like, well,
 let's stop and get a sub. And it's like five to midnight closes at midnight. And we all go in.
 He's already the guy in there.
 He's already begun to put the food away.
 So he's loving that you just showed up then.
 Well, it's still before midnight.
 So we go in and we say, no, we'll just have the stuff that's here.
 So don't go back and get everything.
 We'll just make up, you know, whatever is here.
 So let's say it's a tuna sandwich.
 Yeah.
 Sandra is tired.
 John's tired.
 They take their sandwiches, go sit in the car.
 And as Sandra gets in the car.
 She looks at me through the window, the subway,
 and she looks at me with those eyes of,
 "You better not make this long."
 (laughing)
 And she's wagging her finger like, "No, don't do it.
 "Don't ask him if he's got pain."
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I can see it.
 And being a loving husband, if my wife says,
 "No, I'm gonna go go.
 "I'm gonna, yeah, sure, sure."
 I will do that just to get back at her for whatever.
 Husbands occasionally do that.
 They don't always listen to their wives.
 So here we are, like two minutes before midnight,
 and I say to the guy,
 "By the way, do you have any pain in your body?"
 And he's like,
 "And often people will say,
 "What?
 "What did you just say?"
 And it's like, "Do you have any pain in your body,
 "physical pain?"
 And he goes, "Yeah, I can't remember what the problem was."
 And it's like,
 well, I have a little five seconds saying
 that I do that gets rid of the pain.
 would you let to get rid of the pain?"
 And he goes, "Yes."
 So I've learned not to use the word prayer.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So I said, "Repeat after me.
 "My healing belongs to me because what Jesus has done,
 "I receive my healing now."
 And he says that, and I go check yourself
 and he checks himself and he's moving his back,
 whatever was wrong with him.
 And you can see on their faces when they're healed.
 Like they're trying to find the pain,
 it's just not there.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so he's like, "Oh my goodness."
 And he goes, "What did you do?"
 And I said, "Actually, I didn't do anything.
 You did something.
 You invited Jesus."
 And he was of Indian descent.
 And so he did the head wobble.
 He goes, "Yes, I did do that."
 And it was just like,
 it was such a wonderful little thing
 and I had nothing to do with it.
 It was basically on a dare for my wife.
 Don't you dare delay us getting home
 because we're tired.
 And it's like, "Well, I'll take that dare."
 (laughing)
 And a guy got healed.
  </li><li>That's exactly what she was meaning.
  </li><li>Well, anyways, that's the way I took it.
 So I get in the car and she goes,
 he got healed, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 It's two minutes, Santa, to heal a guy.
 So anyways, I love that God talks to us,
 gives us assignments,
 and we get to be heroes for people.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's amazing.
  </li><li>He's gonna go home and tell his,
 I don't know, he's maybe 1920.
 So he's gonna tell his parents,
 he's going to tell his roommate. Yeah. Guess what happened to me? Yeah. These guys came in just as
 I'm closing shop. I'm all upset that they're here. You know, I've already started putting stuff away
 and I got healed. Yeah. But guess what I'm paying for. I remember I still remember the Sunday that
 you had Sam come in Sam. What was his last name? Sam, Larby. Larby. Yeah. London, England. He's a
  </li><li>Yeah. - I think he was in the Ghanaian army.
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause Alan, after that,
 I literally had to, I'm not even joking,
 I would plan that we needed to leave 20 minutes early
 to go anywhere if he was gonna see people
 because he just would ask everybody.
 So I can totally relate to Sandra
 because it was just like,
 "We're gonna be late for everything
 "for the rest of our lives now."
 I mean, it's very cool, you know, but you know.
  </li><li>It has its rewards. - Yes.
 And, you know, I just got so many amazing stories
 about healing that I'm absolutely confident
 that God wants people well.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So can I pray for people?
 Would that be all right that you're listening, watching?
  </li><li>Yeah, absolutely.
 Good, yeah.
  </li><li>So I'm gonna look at the camera here.
 I'm gonna just move my microphone.
  </li><li>Good job, look at you.
  </li><li>Steady, yeah.
 So friends that are listening, friends that are watching,
 Whatever you've been diagnosed with, the good news is that Jesus has already got history
 of healing then.
 And if it's happened once, it can happen twice.
 And it can happen three times, four times, a million times.
 And the will of God, as recorded in this wonderful prayer that Jesus gave, that followers of
 Jesus, many of them, especially for those of you in the Catholic faith, you pray this prayer
 every single day.
 So something like, I don't know, 300 million Catholics every day, say our Father.
 And right in there is the will of God that whatever is happening in heaven,
 which is no sickness, no pain is supposed to happen on planet earth.
 So daddy, we just speak healing to every single person.
 And those of you that are listening, I'd like you just to close your eyes and just
 Begin to feel the presence.
 Begin to feel the power of God coming on your body,
 touching your body.
 And that can feel a number of different things.
 That could be all of a sudden there's peace.
 You can feel weight on your body.
 That's called glory.
 Your body can be tingling.
 Your body could be having some mild vibrations.
 your hands start to twitch a little bit.
 You can maybe, maybe it's like you're starting
 to tear up right now.
 And those are all signs that Jesus is with you right now.
 He is, he's heard your desire and he's with you.
 And it is absolutely God's will that you be healed
 and is demonstrated by Jesus.
 It's a simple thing of just tapping into the anointing,
 the supernatural power of God.
 And so we say anointing come, heal every sickness,
 every disease that our friends may be battling
 and struggling against.
 And we speak life into you.
 One last verse, friends, John chapter 10, verse 10.
 Jesus says, "Satans resume, Satan's purpose,
 his mission statement is to kill your body,
 steal your finances, destroy your relationships.
 Those are the three big topics that Jesus talked about.
 So Satan comes to steal, kill, and destroy,
 but I came to give life and to give it abundantly.
 So if we break it down instead of Satan trying to kill you,
 Jesus is coming to bring life.
 That's his purpose, was to help people who were sick,
 who were dying, serious diseases,
 people with cancers and tumors,
 that life is being stolen from them prematurely.
 And we say to those kinds of things,
 if that's you, if you've got a serious life-threatening
 disease, I just wanna say, it is God's will.
 Jesus himself said that he came to give you life.
 And so I speak over your body right now and say,
 life to you right now, receive life, receive health
 in Jesus' name.
 And I wanna encourage you to check yourself right now.
 And even if there's a tiny little bit of improvement,
 That's a good thing and you need to celebrate that.
 You need to thank the Lord for that.
 You need to hold on to what you've received
 and to expect that it's gonna continue
 because the Bible also says that everything
 that Jesus begins, He finishes.
  </li><li>Yeah, so good.
  </li><li>Amen.
  </li><li>Amen.
 Well, thanks Steve, that was wonderful.
  </li><li>Hey Jay, this was fun.
  </li><li>So good.
  </li><li>I love talking about healing.
