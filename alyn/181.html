<p> I'll in a days podcast for Monday most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to episode one eighty one of keeping up with the jones is did you hear American I sounded one eighty one you did you sounded super American.
 Which is bizarre because we have visitors from the UK so you should sound more you can you welcome to episode one eighty one of keeping up with the jones is a welcome.
 Keeping up with the Jones is like of episode one eight one very nice okay that better yes that's better
 well welcome this week we're talking all about the need for inner healing but before we get to
 that super important topic aj tell me about this week we had a fun week so full week we taught all
 the students how to teach how to so how to prepare a message how to deliver a message you know all
 the components thereof yeah it's so fun i got to be really nerdy i love teaching the you got to be
 really nerdy. I did. You would be hard to remove the nerdy bit. No, but I love doing all the behind
 the scenes of how we do what we do. Yeah. Like, I remember my professor when I was learning to
 teach his name was Dr. Tom Conlon, and he always taught about the importance of making your thinking
 visible. So most of the time that people hear us teach, they're just receiving the end product.
 So it's fun to sit with a group of students and say, "This is how we get to our end product."
 Yeah, this is all the behind the scenes of how we think about preparing a message. This is what we do when we're delivering a message.
 Yeah, this is why we sometimes do this. You know, and I loved it. There's something beautiful about getting to share the elements of your craft.
 Yeah, I had several conversations with students about the intentionality behind stuff that they thought was random.
 Oh, wow.<br/>
 Oh, they're so little of what we do that's random.
 But yeah, we're almost always up to something or there's a reason.
 There's something that the Holy Spirit taught us to do.
 Right.<br/>
 And there's a reason that we're doing it at the moment.
 We're doing it.<br/>
 But yeah.<br/>
 You know, we were talking about the masterclass website, you know, the, you, I bought you
 the Gordon Ramsey masterclass for Christmas.
 I love, it doesn't really matter what the topic is.
 I love watching experts at their work and learning from them.
 And so it was fun to do an element of that.
 I really, really enjoyed this week.<br/>
 and I'm really looking forward to seeing the students deliver their messages next week.
 Same. I'm really excited about that. I think it's two weeks away, really.
 Uh-huh. I think so.<br/>
 Well, this week they've got dream interpretation.
 And then the next week they're up.<br/>
 Oh, you're right. You're absolutely correct.
 I am sign-biting that and that's going to be my ringtone.
 I'm sure you are, darling.<br/>
 No, definitely.<br/>
 Talk to us about the declaration dinner. It's something we do a lot at Gray Center
 And I think it's a beautiful concept. You went to one on Tuesday night.
 So we've been doing them at Grace Center, different departments and stuff
 for a couple of years. And it comes out of just understanding that your words have power and
 setting goals and giving basically the Holy Spirit something to aim at. Does it make sense?
 Yeah.<br/>
 And so everybody sort of makes sure that they have a time with the Lord where they pray and they
 ask the Lord and they journal with him about what is this year look like? What would they
 they like to see happen, what are their goals, what is Holy Spirit saying, all that kind
 of stuff.<br/>
 And then you have a dinner together.<br/>
 And at some point you all kind of sit in a circle and go run the circle and make declarations
 about what this year is going to be for you.
 So I mean, it was really interesting.<br/>
 It was interesting on a number of levels.
 We had some wordsmiths that, you know, crafted beautiful statements that could probably be
 Stitched on a pillow and then you had people like me that were just like I will blah blah blah
 You know and<br/>
 Then there you know would it would range from I will lead a hundred people to the Lord this year to I
 Will learn to deadlift 350 pounds to you know
 I will get healthy or you know, whatever the things are and so you all declare it in your community of believers
 and then once you're finished your declarations, we all say together, "Yeah, we agree."
 So apparently they've done it the last couple of years and then at the end of the year,
 they all get together and celebrate all the things that God's done.
 It sounds amazing. It sounds absolutely amazing.
 Another highlight this week is our friends Ben and Sarah from Toronto in town.
 Sarah's come in to teach on our school. Sarah's a really gifted dream interpreter,
 And so she comes in and she teaches her students the process of dream interpretation, gets them
 interpreting dreams, and then we'll be spending time with our second year students teaching all
 the advanced dream interpretation stuff that she doesn't have time to fit into first year.
 Yes.<br/>
 So we always love when they come to town, their foodies, their good peeps, and we've enjoyed
 catching up with them. We've also managed to infect them. They're the second people we've managed to
 infect and staying in our house. Yes, with Zelda.
 Yeah, explain.<br/>
 Well, well, here's the thing.<br/>
 I think Ben may have come pre disposition to infection because he apparently has played
 every Zelda game on every platform or something like that.
 Right.<br/>
 He listened to our episode that we talked about Zelda a couple of weeks ago.
 And so he texted me before he got here and he said, just so you know, I've just
 finished listening to your Zelda episode.
 I have played every single game on every single platform of Zelda.
 I don't plan on getting any sleep this week.
 Right.<br/>
 But Sarah was here a couple of days early.
 And so I sort of got to soft launch her into it.
 And it was funny because I sent Ben a text saying, I'm going to get Sarah
 addicted so that, you know, you guys can play this together.
 And isn't Sarah similar to you in that she's not a huge gamer?
 She is not a huge gamer.<br/>
 She didn't have the vitriolic hatred of Zelda that you had.
 No, but she just wasn't interested except, you know, the kids were playing.
 We were playing, you know, whatever.<br/>
 And so she got interested.<br/>
 And so by the first evening, she said, I think I quite like to try it, but I don't know all the buttons.
 And now she wants to be included in the rotation for a turn.
 So the long and short of it is they went to Best Buy today to pick one up.
 They did.<br/>
 So I think we should be getting some sort of kickbacks from Nintendo.
 Right.<br/>
 Cause that's the second guest that stayed in her house and then has promptly left and bought a switch.
 So we definitely need some sort of loyalty.
 Something.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah, for sure.<br/>
 Um, we also discovered.<br/>
 A new taco place.<br/>
 Go on.<br/>
 So Sarah and I were at the factory and, uh, they're about to open mojo's tacos, uh,
 where sapphires used to be.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 But for right now, it's on a food truck, uh, out front of the factory.
 While the restaurant's being renovated.
 Yes.<br/>
 And so we were like, huh, you know,<br/>
 Sarah's pregnant, so that's my excuse.
 So I'm like, oh, did you snack before we go home and eat lunch?
 Sarah is pregnant, so that's my excuse.
 Isn't that her excuse?<br/>
 I said, yeah, you know, like I'm using her as my excuse.
 Oh, I see.<br/>
 So originally our plan was, oh, we'll just go and grab a taco each.
 And that will hold us over till we go home and make lunch kind of thing.
 Because it was like, I don't know, 10 to 12 or something.
 So we went and ordered a brisket taco each.
 And two things of corn for the girls.<br/>
 And so they ate the corn and kept saying, this is so yummy.
 This is so yummy.<br/>
 And I'm not joking.<br/>
 I think it's the best brisket taco I've ever had possibly the best taco I've ever had ever.
 I praise so good based on the volumes of tacos.
 We go, right?<br/>
 We eat a lot of tacos.<br/>
 Um, so at that point, here's what I don't understand.
 How did you know I was there?<br/>
 Because I'm sitting there with a taco in my hand and I'm thinking, do I buy him tacos?
 or do I go home and make him food, which was our plan?
 And then you're like, you better not come home
 without bringing me tacos.<br/>
 Like almost like you're inside my hand.
</p><ul>
  <li>I don't think I was that abrupt.
  </li><li>Oh, do you want me to find the text?
 It was something like that.
  </li><li>I'm not the only prophetic person in our family.
  </li><li>Do you have access to some sort of cameras
 at the factory that I don't know about?
 (laughs)
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>Did Siri send you a message against my will?
  </li><li>As soon as you paid with a credit card,
 I get a receipt 'cause they use square.
 And it was like, welcome to your first purchase.
 you know, mojo tacos.
 And I was like, oh, really, you're trying mojo tacos
 without me?
 That is not happening.
  </li><li>I'm sorry, I had to.
  </li><li>I mean, you redeemed yourself
 by bringing me home Mexican Coke.
  </li><li>I did, I brought you Mexican Coke,
 but sadly we ordered corn and didn't end up bringing it home.
 I must have left it on the side or something.
 I'm sorry about that.
 But I brought you home tacos and were they fantastic?
  </li><li>They were.
  </li><li>So-- - A Mexican Coke,
 for those of you who don't know, in America,
 everything seems to be sweetened
 with high fructose corn syrup, which is from the culinary pits of hell.
 Yeah.
 And in Mexico, like many other countries, they don't use high fructose corn syrup.
 They use just cane sugar.
 Yeah.
 So the Coca-Cola for Mexico is way tastier than the Coca-Cola in America.
 Yes.
 And also doesn't have high fructose corn syrup, but does have sugar in it.
 Right.
 Mine is delicious, though.
 And it's served in glass bottles, which makes everything taste better.
 Of course.
 which somehow from the beauty of cocaine glass bottles leads us to this week's main topic.
 Yes, inner healing and it leaves perfectly from cocaine glass bottles.
 I don't know. Both are examples of the glory of God to me.
 Okay. Our topic this week comes from a fantastic question asked by one of our listeners.
 Kelsey Rowan and she said, "Hi Alan and AJ, I love your podcast and listen to every week."
 This question is mostly for AJ I think. Through listening to the podcast, I've only heard
 small bits and pieces of your testimony, but it seems like the thing that stands out is
 how healthy you are after having gone through so much. I'm currently in a season of life
 where so many things are going wrong. It seems every part of my life is under attack, my family,
 my work, my health. I've been paddling with despair and anger. I've been calling out to God to rescue
 me or to bring peace to some part of my life. I spend most of my time outside of work reading
 the Bible and listening to podcasts because many times I don't know if I have the strength
 to do anything else and I don't know what else to do but cling to his word and promises like
 I'm clinging to a rope in a fierce storm. It's a daily battle to believe this and many days I
 don't win this battle of believing that it will ever be better. After hearing that you've been
 through so much yet now you are so healthy and sometimes don't even remember some of the past
 events that have occurred in your life, I wanted to ask advice on how you got to where you are.
 What steps did you take in your life to get from where you were to where you are now?
 Well, Kelsey, I think I want to start by saying I'm really sorry that you're in such a tough
 season. Yeah. That sounds really, really difficult. And the important thing is, well,
 one of the important things is to not pretend it doesn't feel as hard as it feels, you know,
 because actually you can't be real with God if you can't be real with yourself and just sort of
 assess actually this is really hard and I need to break through. When you were talking the verse
 from Psalm 27 I think verse 13 that says I would have despaired unless I believe that I would see
 the goodness of God and the land of the living went through my head and I want to start by saying
 you know God is really no respecter of persons what he's done for me he'll do for you and he loves
 to heal our hearts. Any place that we're willing to open up our hearts and let him
 in, let him help us with what's residing there, the pain, the hurt, the anger, that kind of stuff.
 He is so good at knowing exactly what needs to be removed or what needs to be added and
 you know all that kind of stuff to get our hearts to a place where we can not only cope but thrive.
 But in our healing or healing the heart, it's a fairly long process sometimes. I mean sometimes
 God does something or parts of it really quick and other parts of it are a little bit longer.
 And so some of it is, wow, it's quite the journey, but it's a journey that has a big
 treasure at the end, you know.
 And I think it's important to note that I think when you showed up at the church in
 Toronto, you didn't know what you have today was even possible.
 I had no idea.
 I mean, I thought what I needed to do was survive life and then I would eventually get
 to die and go to heaven.
 I mean, that was my big dream.
 Right.
 And many Christians are confused about the journey of being healed.
 They think that either you just push it out of your mind and quote some
 scripture to keep it back.
 Yeah.
 Or there's kind of really no hopes you just do the best you can.
 Yeah.
 Or you just don't crumble to complain because that would just be a
 discretit to Jesus and these kind of like various methodologies or you
 medicate, whether it's with alcohol or with busyness or with hyper religious
 activity, you know, whatever the thing is.
 We will cope somehow with the pain that we have.
  </li><li>The funny thing is everybody,
 well, this isn't funny,
 I was gonna say the funny thing is everybody has pain.
 That's not what I meant to say.
 It's easy to look at your life, AJ,
 and say, okay, you grew up in a really abusive home,
 you had cross addicted parents,
 you're a beast of social fear,
 you try to kill yourself very early in life.
 It's easy to look at that and go,
 "Well, no wonder you had issues."
 But the truth is, all of us have been hurt in life.
 Yeah, every single person on the planet.
 And a lot of us who haven't gone through the trauma that you have
 tend to think we don't need what we're talking about in this episode.
 Like, I'm fine. I'm good.
 I'm not like a basket case. I get up.
 I go to work every day. I'm good.
 But what we don't realize is how good are we?
 Like, how much are we managing our pain or covering the pain or ignoring the pain?
 Or how much are we just in denial that we're even in pain?
 And I think too, like again, you reference my childhood and whatnot.
 And yes, obviously I've had a fair amount of pain, but I think pain is pain is pain.
 Do you know what I mean?
 Like one person's pain in their childhood is as valid as my pain, you know what I mean?
 And God wants to meet us in the midst of that and free us from that pain.
 So it, I kind of always thought like I will always be defined by everything I've been through.
 Like, that is the sum of me is what I've survived.
 And, you know, it wasn't really until the revival started in Toronto and I started
 getting a lot of inner healing and doing like soaking sort of against my will where
 God would pin me to the floor and stuff like that, you know, where I was like, Oh,
 like, I don't actually have to be defined by this.
 I remember, I remember the Lord saying to me one day, you can choose to be defined
 by what you've been through, or you can choose to be defined by me, but you can't choose both.
 But to choose to be defined by God means you have to let go of all that stuff and to let go of it,
 you need to actually give it to him first. Right. So we've talked about a bunch of things,
 and you've sweepingly said a bunch of statements that mean a lot to me and you,
 but might not mean a lot to our listeners. So you said, you know, I did a lot of
 inner healing, I'd love to talk to you about what does it look like for one to do inner healing?
 That's my first question. The second thing is, you have to let go, you have to give that to God
 first. So talk to me about what it means to do inner healing. Talk to me about what it means to
 let go of what's happened to you and talk to me about what it means to give that to God.
 Okay. Well, first of all, I guess there's a number of different tools that we have in our toolbox
 of inner healing as it were, right?
  </li><li>Our being grace and healing.
  </li><li>Our being churches that specialize in inner healing.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So your number one tool for working through anything
 is forgiveness.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>It's the thing that we need to get the best at.
 If we wanna actually be able to love our neighbors
 as ourselves and even love ourselves, forgiveness is a key.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And it's something that you can use daily
 and you will use daily.
 And it gets used on the big stuff and the little stuff,
 but it's powerful.
 We have other tools that we use that are things like,
 understanding what ungodly beliefs are
 and how to unwind those and inner vows and different,
 there's different sort of teachings and areas
 where we tend to get stuck.
 And it's in that stuckness that we tend to lose hope.
 So if we can actually, if you can get a hold of,
 and we can probably point you towards some resources.
 in the notes. But if you can get ahold of some resources on inner healing and actually go and
 actually get some ministry, get some people to pray for you, that will help you a lot because when
 you get stuck, they don't get stuck. So they're able to kind of help you unwind things.
 I think we have to back up quite a bit and just say that when Jesus died on the cross,
 it wasn't just for the forgiveness of our sins. It wasn't just the forgiveness of our sins,
 although if that's all it were, that would be phenomenal.
 But it was also the healing of all our pain and all our sickness.
 So in the cross is the provision for us to be made whole, to be made free, free from addiction,
 free from bondage, free from poverty, free from sickness, free from torment, all these things.
 Free from depression.
 Right.
 that we've just kind of normalized as life.
 Yeah.
 And Jesus is like, no, I'd actually like all that stuff.
 I'd like your hurt and your disappointment and your pain, your jealousy, your envy, your
 fear.
 I paid for all of it.
 I paid for all of it and I would like that.
 That's probably the foundation of this concept of what we call inner healing.
 Physical healing would be kind of outside of the body, although of course it happens
 on the inside if you've got like diabetes, for example, but inner healing tends to be
 talking about the issues of the heart. And when you're talking about different tools,
 all you're talking about is revelation from scripture, like forgiveness, like repentance,
 like in Hebrews 14, it says, see to it that no bitter root grows up and defiles many.
 Like that actually means something. There are things called bitter roots or the astonishing
 revelation of a big name, generational iniquity, the fact that the results of the sins of our
 fathers and our forefathers, the results of that can actually be passed down on effect children.
 It is an astonishing revelation. When we talk about going for inner healing,
 it usually means that we're either at a conference or we're in a prayer session with people who are
 well versed in understanding these concepts and are equipped to lead us through, usually
 by prayer, sometimes through deliverance, to actually bring areas of healing to our
 heart that Jesus has already paid for.
 Yeah.
 And I think honestly, if I could script people's inner healing journey, I would want them
 to really know who the Father is before they head into major inner healing.
 And the reason being you can face anything when you know you're not alone.
 You know, so for me, I spent a lot of time letting or getting to know the father really,
 you know, letting him in.
 And it took me a good while and that had a lot to do with my testimony and stuff.
 But because I started to believe he was good, then he wasn't going to leave me alone and
 he wasn't, you know, that a bruise read, he wouldn't crush.
 And all the things that scripture says, I started to believe those things.
 I could actually be brave enough to face the pain I'd hidden from and actually start to
 work it through with people.
 But also just with God sometimes just listening to music and the Lord would bring back a memory
 and we'd sort of work it through.
 God, what did you want me to understand during this memory and work that kind of stuff through?
 So, inner healing is a journey.
 It doesn't happen overnight.
 I mean, you probably have big sort of leapfrog moments and then you have other stuff that
 that you just keep having to take a shot at,
 to hit at until it's a manageable place
 where you can fully sort of give it over.
 It's hard to, without actually teaching,
 all the different teachings, it's hard to say,
 hey, just go get some tools.
 But there really are amazing ministries out there
 that can help you.
 And then there's also amazing teachings
 that can give you those tools.
 I think it's amazing that a lot of the church somehow, Biosmosis, has arrived at the conclusion
 that if you feel pain, you're somehow weak.
 You're not very spiritually mature.
 Yeah, I think that I've heard that a lot.
 And so therefore the goal is to not feel pain or not be offended or not be hurt.
 So we'll just mature ourselves out of feeling anything, which is terrible theology, like
 absolutely terrible.
 Yes.
 It also means we can't get healed because we're living in denial.
 Right.
 We're not actually talking to the Lord about the areas of our hurt, the areas of our disappointment.
 And then we get into the process of sin management.
 And there's so that's one misconception.
 The other misconception I hear a lot in some churches is people love to quote 2 Corinthians 5 17.
 You know, if anyone is in Christ, he's a new creation.
 Old things have passed away, behold, all things have become new.
 Now, I'm reading that with a little bit of sarcasm on my voice.
 It's certainly not sarcasm at the truth that's in that scripture that is absolutely true.
 I can get into the Greek of it.
 I'm not a Greek scholar, so I would be on shaky ground.
 I like what the new living well, basically before I get to the new living translation, the
 MIV, the concept is, Hey, your new creation suck up like nothing should be affecting you.
 That's certainly how people are using it.
 That kind of hits all under the blood.
 So the cross.
 It's all in that over here.
 Old man.
 It's a man.
 It's fine.
 You know, it's like dealing with a three year old like, Oh,
 this is tragic.
 I have a lollipop.
 Look,
 everything's fine.
 Stop crying.
 And the notion that, you know, once you said the salvation
 prayer, you know, everything's fine.
 But I love what the new living translation, the way it's rendered,
 it says this means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person.
 The old life is gone and a new life has begun.
 And so there's this process in salvation
 of the sovereignty of God and the sanctification from God.
 Sovereignty of God is things just happen instantly.
 So I've got a friend that when they got saved, they instantly were delivered of cigarettes.
 They no longer had a craving for nicotine, but they still cussed like a sailor.
 Right.
 All right.
 So like, what, you know, if we're new creation, why wasn't it all taken care of?
 Right.
 Well, there's this process of some stuff God does instantly.
 And then there's this whole concept and scripture of New Testament believers walking out and working out their faith.
 And that's, I think, the journey of inner healing.
 One of my favorite verses is Paul writing to the churches in Ephesus.
 This is Ephesians 4 verse 30.
 And he's writing to church people, to Christians.
 He says, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption."
 Now, first question is, why would Christians need to be told not to grieve the Holy Spirit?
 Right.
 Probably because on a regular basis, they were.
 Right.
 So that's fascinating.
 So how does one grieve the Holy Spirit?
 It says this, get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, brawling, slander along with every form of malice.
 But my second question is, if we interpret 2 Corinthians 5, 17 as, hey, as soon as we got saved, everything is, you know, magically change.
 Why do you have to get rid of it?
 Right.
 Why do Christians still have bitterness, rage, anger, brawling, slander, along with every
 kind of malice?
 Right.
 It's the process of getting rid of all that stuff.
 Bitterness is hurt that hasn't been dealt with.
 Rage and anger are areas of hurt that we have not allowed the Holy Spirit to heal.
 Brawling and slander comes from jealousy and a critical spirit.
 So basically Paul's just saying,
 "Hey, work on your stuff guys.
 "Be kind and compassionate to one another.
 "Forgive one another just as in Christ God forgave you."
 Right there is this whole pleading
 from this apostolic father saying,
 "Guys, work on your heart.
 "Allow the Holy Spirit to deliver to Jesus
 "what Jesus paid for."
  </li><li>Right, and the thing that's wonderful about it
 is Jesus with what Jesus did for us,
 made it so you're not doing it on your own
 and neither am I.
 And that's the beautiful thing.
  </li><li>It's stunning, but there's work to be done.
  </li><li>There absolutely is, Philippians 2.12 says,
 "Work out your salvation with fear and trembling."
 There is a process where you allow what Jesus did
 on the cross to affect your life.
 That means saying no to certain things
 and yes to other things.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>That looks like humbling yourself,
 forgiving one another, et cetera.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Or how about Romans 12 verse two?
  </li><li>Killer.
 says be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
 Right. We have to think different thoughts. That's where our declarations come in.
 And then in Ephesians 4, 22, verse 24, it says, "Put off the old man and put on the new." Again,
 there's this tension to live like we used to and not what's available to us. And I think like in
 my own life, the joy of being in a culture like Grace Center where Jeff and Becky, as our senior
 leaders are so pro in our healing, are so into authenticity. They're not trying to be a different
 version of themselves. They publicly share the stuff that they've struggled with, which creates
 an environment where we're like, you mean, we're not all faking trying to be amazing Christians,
 you mean, we all get to have stuff that we can help with, where we have people who are
 whose full-time jobs at Grey Center are to actually help people get whole.
 Is phenomenal.
 Yeah, I love it.
 What if you're not at Grey Center?
 Like, what are some of the resources that are available that would help people in their journey
 to receiving inner healing?
 I think if you can find either restoring the foundation's ministers.
 I'll put a link in the show notes to those.
 Yeah, or heart sink ministers. That would be a good first, you know, like starting down
 the path of dealing with some stuff. Restoring the foundations is a really in-depth, several
 day session where somebody else is helping you sort of deal with this stuff that you
 don't realize has got you.
 Or identify the things, identify things you're thinking that are keeping you stuck.
 and helping you process the pain that you might not even acknowledge is pain in your life.
 Right. And then they also deal with the generational stuff like you were mentioning earlier and
 whatever. So it's a great like all over deep cleaning of your house kind of thing.
 Heart sink is like, I don't even know how to describe heart sink.
 Good luck describing heart sink. I don't think I can. Heart sink is usually just like a two-hour
 session or a three hour session and it's just completely Holy Spirit led like Holy Spirit.
 What do you want to do?
 And then you just sort of follow the meandering trail of whatever God's doing to unwind something.
 But usually it's fairly issue focused and it's dealing with one particular area where
 RTF is doing a much broader stroke kind of thing.
 So honestly they both go together really well.
 I would honestly suggest both. We've, we've done both.
 I love both. Yeah. We've done RTF. We've done heart sync several times.
 And it's really funny because what every time we go for heart sync,
 I have no idea what God's going to do because I'm not usually going
 with something. I'm just going saying, Hey, God, would you know,
 I'm giving other people permission to look at my heart
 and and help me where I might not see what I'm doing or see what's going on.
 Even I say even like this is the bottom run.
 That's not what I mean at all.
 But even seeing a licensed Christian counselor is a great is phenomenal.
 I'm in grief counseling the moment.
 I'm seeing a wonderful counselor every week.
 I get to go and for an hour I get to sit in process.
 And for me, I don't even think I was in grief.
 I just went because I was like, you know, I'm having these thoughts
 without my permission.
 I should probably just go check that out with a professional.
 And right.
 And he was like, Alan, like you are in grief.
 But you're in denial about your grief.
 He's like, really?
 OK, well, let's let's process that like not running from that, not being ashamed of that.
 It is a tremendous help hearing the Holy Spirit of following the Holy Spirit when
 the Holy Spirit talks about forgiving.
 There's a couple of excellent books I would recommend.
 You know, if you're not in a community that is is open to inner healing, some really,
 really helpful books to read. Derek Prince, Blessing or Curse, you can choose as a fascinating
 introduction to the concept of curses. I know that might be a little bit out there for some of us,
 but it's maybe not what you want to start with. It is though. It's very, very good. Very,
 very good at introducing that there are outside forces that are affecting the quality of your life
 and how to deal with that. Your book, Finding Father, is going to be an excellent journey into
 discovering the father and helping you understand the importance of forgiveness.
 And it does work through a lot of hindrances and things like that as well.
 Right. Neil Anderson's book, The Bondage Breaker, again, is just a great step-by-step book through
 that. That was one of the ones I worked through at the very beginning was The Bondage Breaker.
 It was great. John and Carol wrote a book called Grace and Forgiveness. It's not even a big book,
 book. It's a very small book to work it through, but wow, the tool. It's excellent.
 If I can think of any more, I'll put them in the show notes. I'll put a link to the ministries
 that we were talking about. The other thing is, this is kind of hot off the presses. I
 don't think we've announced this yet, but Grace Center has these things called encounter
 weekends. They're a little short, highly concentrated, inner healing weekends that we do at Grace
 Center and previously they've only been open to our church members but we're about to very
 shortly open up to anybody.
 So even if you're not a member of Gray Center, so if you're within driving distance of Gray
 Center, check Gray Center's website for when we're doing those encounter weekends and come
 for a weekend.
 I mean, the testimonies we get just from people going through a weekend of concentrated inner
 healing is phenomenal.
 Yeah.
 I'd highly recommend it.
 Or you actually want to have a mini vacation in Nashville and have some inner healing mixed
 in with that.
 Genius idea.
 I think there's one coming up at the beginning of March.
 You could check the dates at graceinner.us.
 But yeah, they're excellent and certainly a great first step and yeah, you'll walk away
 with a number of tools that will help you actually navigate some of the stuff that you're going
 through.
 But to answer Kelsey's question regarding you, I know that you've been on a like,
 a 20 year journey of inner healing.
 But talk us through just some of the major events
 of what your inner healing journey looked like.
  </li><li>Well, I would say to begin with,
 I spent a lot of time running from God,
 even though it was being very kind.
  </li><li>Like hiding from him?
  </li><li>Hiding from him.
 And just kind of almost surviving him as well,
 not realizing I didn't have to survive him.
  </li><li>Right.
 And then when the renewal started in Toronto, it was really hard because of how strong the presence of the Holy Spirit was to hide from God.
 And so it ended up being like most nights, everybody would get prayer.
 And, you know, when you just keep getting prayer, the Lord just keeps doing stuff.
 So I spent a lot of time, you know, just lying on the floor sometimes just because I lied down.
 So I didn't have to worry about sitting up while processing with the Lord, or even just
 putting on soaking music in my apartment and lying there and just inviting God to come
 and heal my heart.
 And he would do amazing things like he would bring back memories or he would just talk
 to me about different things.
 And it was that still small voice just that had so much life on it.
 I knew it wasn't mine.
 So that would be how it all started.
 He was very gentle and very kind.
 And occasionally if there was things that I wasn't letting go of, he would bring a slightly
 stronger messenger along to say, "Hey, have you thought about, you know, to kind of challenge
 me and go, 'Oh, okay, yes.'"
 And then of course the message of the fatherhood of God probably brought the most healing for
 me.
 Once I could work through forgiveness, let go of my dad, start to work through some stuff
 with my family and really know that God was in the process with me and that I wasn't alone
 and they had a good plan for me, then it got easier.
 So I just sort of headed in that direction and I got counseling from Christian counselors.
 I did encounter weekends.
 I did tons of encounter weekends.
 If there was an opportunity to go and serve, I went and serve so I could hear it again.
 And I, you know, we had services every night of the week, but I just showed up for everything
 I could show up for and tried to stay as open to God as I could in the moment that I was
 in.
 You know, you had your days where you're better at that.
 Other days where maybe I'm a bit more tired or more grumpy, but just sort of trying to
 be as real as I could and like, God, do what He wanted to do.
 But the important thing I think is you were in a culture and an environment that valued
 in or healing. So everywhere you went, that your leaders were well versed and saturated
 in the value of having healed up heart.
 Yeah. And I could be honest about what I was going through and I could get prayer for what
 I was going through without anybody judging me. I never felt judged for any of the things
 that I felt. And I felt a lot. You know, so, yeah, I mean, having people around you that
 have tools to help you when you get stuck is very valuable.
 It all comes down to Proverbs 4 23, where it says, "Above all else, guard your heart
 for everything you do flows from it.
 If your heart is not whole, your life will be broken."
 Yeah, it's well worth the effort.
 And it's probably going to be a process because it is for most people.
 But I want to encourage you, whoever you are, not just Kelsey, but everybody who's
 listening, stay in the process. It's worth it. And honestly, I often think I cannot believe
 that I feel the way I feel about life. I mean, I'm happy. I'm living out my destiny. Do you
 know what I mean? Like, I mean, all these things that I didn't even hope for. I mean,
 I didn't even know to hope for. I just thought, I just got to make it till I finally get to
 die, you know? Oh my gosh. And I know it's depressing, you know, but so when I look back
 on that, I'm like, God, you're so good. And you're so faithful and you're so kind. And
 you didn't leave me where I was. But you picked me up and you helped me along. And he didn't
 give up. I mean, lots of times I wanted to give up. He didn't give up on me. He's not
 going to give up on you either. So my encouragement is stay in the process, get help in the process,
 believe God and just keep walking forward into the love that he has for you.
 I love that.
 So I hope that's an encouragement to everyone.
 Go after all that Jesus has paid for.
 He wants you to have as much of him as you can possibly get.
 And the reason he stretches you is to fit more of him in you.
 Unrelated, but sort of related.
 But very related.
 We also have the privilege of overseeing an amazing school.
 It's an eight month school here in Franklin, Tennessee, called the School of Supernatural
 Life.
 One of the major focuses of the school is having a healed up heart.
 Because it's true.
 You've heard it said before that healed people, healed people, hurt people, hurt people.
 We don't want people who can interpret dreams and heal the sick and prophesy if they're
 full of owies.
 And so our school, the eight month school here in Franklin, Tennessee is designed to bring
 healing to areas of your heart.
 You may not even recognize need healing and the testimonies from our students of a transformed
 life are amazing.
 We would love you to be one of those students.
 If you go to graceenter.us/school, you will learn all about the school.
 You can watch testimonies from students of how their lives have been transformed and you
 You can apply to do the school. Our applications are currently open. We will be closing our
 applications in June, but school starts in September of this year. We run every September
 through April. We would love you to pray about coming and spending eight months and seeing
 the transformation that Jesus would bring in your life and that would end up transforming
 your family, your work environment, your community and your culture. Again, go to graceinner.us/school
 more information about that.
