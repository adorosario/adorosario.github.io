<p> I live in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is a green eyes.
 Hi, you look stunning.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 What do I look like?<br/>
 You look stunning to you.<br/>
 But seriously, you look very handsome.
 Would now be a good time of walking a light.
 Why do you always walk in the light on the radio?
 Because you can't get mad at me when there's lots of people listening.
 I can still get you later.<br/>
 It's not like I don't know where you're sleeping.
</p><ul>
  <li>You tend to forget that you have a very short attention span
 when it comes to my nulltiness.
  </li><li>Well, yes, I have a low vengeance or need for vengeance.
  </li><li>Do you want to tell a story about my community service?
  </li><li>Okay, so a couple of weeks ago, I come home
 and you greet me at the door.
 I think because you're afraid that the kids were gonna out you.
 So you greet me at the door with this story about,
 you know, babe, how we want to like be people in our community
 and we want to get to know people
 and we want to support children and their goals
 and you're going on and on and I was like,
 "What have you done?
 "What have you done?"
 And he's like, "Well, you know, these kids came selling
 "girl guy cookies and I just thought,
 "you know, it'd be wrong not to buy it from them."
 And you know, there are neighbors and so anyway,
 the cookies got dropped off today.
  </li><li>And what I got, I got some moas,
 I got the s'mores, which I think I knew this year,
  </li><li>Maybe they're not.
 And I got some sort of caramel crunch.
  </li><li>You got one kind of gluten-free one.
 So basically, the kids can have that one.
 And the rest of the cookies are all for you, I'm assuming.
  </li><li>Yes, well thank you.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>That's an easier negotiation than I thought.
  </li><li>Well I can't have them, so.
  </li><li>I put them in the freezer,
 'cause apparently they're delicious straight
 from the freezer.
  </li><li>Which ones, all of them?
  </li><li>Well I've only tried two of them so far.
 The Samoas are delicious.
  </li><li>You've already tried two, you've heard,
 they even got no.
  </li><li>General crunch, we're okay.
 And I haven't tried this more yet
 'cause I'm a man of discipline.
  </li><li>Okay, so man of discipline,
 Wendy, I'm trying this more than next week.
  </li><li>Right after this podcast is done.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Incredible discipline.
  </li><li>I didn't know about Girl Scout cookies.
 I knew that was a thing of like an American thing,
 like yellow school buses.
  </li><li>Well, it's also a Canadian thing.
 I mean, I sold Girl Guide Cookies when I was a kid.
  </li><li>Yeah, Girl Guide, not Girl Scouts,
 two completely different things.
  </li><li>Girl Guide cookies are even better.
 (laughs)
 I actually wonder what things have I missed out on not being a child growing up in America?
 Like in Britain, there's all these things that were just part of my childhood,
 like sugar puffs, shreddies, ribina, hula hoops, frazzles.
 What's that horrible stuff that you eat on toast?
 More might.
 So all these things that as an adult, if we immigrated to Britain and you'd never go
 out there, you would never think of trying those things.
 No.
 but you would be enamored by like Indian food and fish and chips and some other stuff,
 but you would never think about trying these things.
 So I'm intrigued.
 What have I missed out American listeners on not growing up in this country?
 Like what are the things from your childhood that you think I would love?
 You've missed out on like, you know,
 Captain Crunch chocolate with little bits of bug in it.
 No, don't you mean seriously?
 I'm intrigued to know.
 Please reach out to me via email or Twitter about the things that are
 representations of your childhood.
 Yeah, I would love to catch up on
 because Girl Scout cookies are this amazing thing that I would never have known about
 save for coming to America.
 Have you heard of Jell-O?
 I have heard of Jell-O.
 I liked Jell-O when I was a kid.
 Let's get some Jell-O.
 But I had Jell-O. I had that in the UK.
 We called it Jell-O, not Jell-O.
 Well, Jell-O is much better. I'm pretty sure.
 I had to get over the difference between Jam and Jell-O in America.
 So peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, we called them peanut butter and jam sandwiches.
 Yes.
 But when we...
 What is it between Jam and Jell-O?
 No, they're the same thing.
 Oh, they are?
 Yeah.
 Okay, I thought one was anyway.
 I literally don't know.
 So please Americans educate me.
 What have I missed out on?
 I can't wait.
 I'm going to systematically work my way through it.
  </li><li>He's so excited.
 I could be that I've missed out on some things too.
 I never got to eat all those sugary cereals
 when I was a kid, my parents wouldn't buy them.
  </li><li>My mother wouldn't let me either.
 We had a diluting juice called Kiaora
 and we were allowed down special occasions
 and potato chips or crisps.
  </li><li>That sounds disgusting.
  </li><li>What?
  </li><li>A diluting juice called Kiaora.
 It sounds like some sort of virus.
 Did you hear about Alan?
 He got Kiaora.
 Oh no, we should pray for him.
  </li><li>We don't really do that in America, I don't think.
 Squashed. - Do you know
 that it's disgusting squash, by the way,
 for listeners who have no clue,
 is another kind of diluting juice
 that you just add water to.
  </li><li>It's a generic term for diluting juice.
 So you would buy-- - Right, not a vegetable.
 It's a diluting juice.
  </li><li>You'd buy all your juice and concentrate,
 and then you'd just put a bit of it and add water.
  </li><li>Yes. - Kind of like so
  </li><li>It's not really.
  </li><li>It's just sugar with dye in it.
 It's so bad.
 But I remember the first time going to the UK
 and somebody asking me, they were doing like drinks.
 Would you like coffee, tea, or squash?
 And I was like, squash the vegetable.
 How are you making that into a beverage?
 And I thought, you're not gonna pass on that.
 That's gonna be a hard pass on the squash.
  </li><li>But I tell you, I loved Robina.
 I still have a craving for Robina.
 Every time I'm in the store and I see Ribena
 in the international section, I pick up some.
  </li><li>Or when you're sick and you're like,
 I just want hot Ribena.
 I'm like, you want hot sugar with dye in it.
 Well, you're sick, that's not gonna help you.
  </li><li>Maybe it's black curtains.
 It's a source of vitamin C.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, big vitamin C content in that beverage right there.
  </li><li>Oh gosh, I love you.
  </li><li>So funny.
  </li><li>All right, talk to me about this week.
  </li><li>We had a great week, didn't we?
 We did. It was nonstop. We actually tried to record this episode of the podcast yesterday.
 We've had our friends, Ben and Sarah from Toronto here all week, and I wanted them on
 the podcast. And so yesterday afternoon, we sat down to record in the studio. But for
 some odd reason, it was so hot in the room.
 Well, it's pretty hot right now.
 Well, no one here is hot as a podcast.
 You know, it was bad yesterday.
 But this is as much as we got. Hi.
 Hello.
 I think we sound delightful.
 It sounds like the voice of heaven.
 But definitely not like a Torontonian.
 That was my point.
 How does a Torontonian sound?
 I'm not even sure there is a real accent for a Torontonian.
 I have it.
 I am the one who holds the Torontonian accent.
 The one Torontonian accent to rule the law.
 It's actually-I 
 don't have an accent.
 We're the only place in the world that doesn't have an accent.
 So I'm sorry you didn't get to hear more of Ben and Sarah,
 and you stuck with us this week.
 But we did try.
 Go back.
 But yeah, full on week teaching, hosting, visiting,
  </li><li>Eating good food, making good food.
  </li><li>You made your pot to cram again.
  </li><li>I did.
  </li><li>And we made the sous vide steak
 and then you seared it beautifully
 while I caramelized brussel sprouts and things.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was delicious.
  </li><li>We saw a rival.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>What did you think of a rival?
  </li><li>Well, I don't typically like alien movies,
 but it was really good.
 I thought it was very touching and not at all I expected.
 -Do you think it's worthy of the eight Oscars has been nominated for?
 -Has it been nominated for eight?
 -Yes, I think so.
 -Well, I certainly think it's more worthy than La La Land.
 Am I allowed to say that?
 -You can say whatever you want.
 I thought the cinematography on it was beautiful.
 I thought the pacing while I would have thought would be slow,
 I thought it was just perfect.
 -Yes.
 -I thought it was a beautiful film.
 I fell asleep halfway through it,
 which I need to rewatch it.
 But that's just because I'm so tired.
 I wasn't bored.
 I thought it was beautiful.
 The pacing was stunning.
 I fell asleep halfway through.
 Yes.
 I was exhausted not because of the movie was boring.
 And I thought the overall theme of it was brilliant.
 And I thought lots of twists and turns.
 And I genuinely loved the movie.
 It was great.
 It was really good.
 That's really a week.
 It was just friends, guests, busy teaching, working.
 You got to speak up at one stone in East Nashville and do
 fell hard and then that was it really wasn't it?
 Yes, I really enjoyed being up at one stone.
 Sweet church, really sweet.
 And you also do you math tacos?
 I did.
 It was my first time at most tacos.
 I never eaten there.
 Well, you went and looked at it and went, I'm not eating here, which I'm not surprised.
 It is a bit of a hole in the wall, but babe, you have to give it another shot.
 I'll try it.
 We can go on a date night.
 It's super cheap too, it's like really inexpensive, but it's so good.
 All right, well, I'm persuaded I'd love to go.
 Okay.
 I've got to mention, I had a craigslist win.
 You did have a craigslist.
 I love craigslist.
 Yeah.
 I really genuinely love a good deal.
 Well, I love a good deal, but I love benefiting from other people's,
 like they've moved on.
 So basically Tia, who is our seven and a half year old,
 that she likes to be called now.
 Yes, she clarified this morning in the car.
 I called them nine and seven and they said, actually, I mean,
 We're both technically halves by now.
 So that's how they want to be referred to.
 They are kids are so excited about their cousins going to stay and they've done the
 math. They've realized if our cousins do come to stay, which they are, but they
 don't know that yet.
 No, they don't, but they don't.
 It's their podcast.
 So we're quite safe, but they've done the math and they're working out where our
 cousins are going to sleep.
 And so Tia said, daddy, you said that I could get a trundle bed and I'd really
 like a trundle bed, a trundle bed for those of you who are not familiar with that terminology.
 like a roll away bed that tucks underneath the main bed. So I tried to find a trundle
 for her existing bed, couldn't realize Craigslist could be my friend, hopped on Craigslist,
 and found a beautiful sleigh bed. So pretty. So pretty with a trundle and two mattresses,
 which normally I'm scared about using somebody else's mattresses, but this was a very nice
 couple and very nice home and the mattress had been kept indoors.
 Did you sniff them the couple I mean to make sure they smell clean? I did. I did. I could
 DNA swab on them while they work with it.
 And the mattress covers bought them home, shoved them in the wash, built the bed,
 and hey, press, so she loves it. And it just beautiful.
 Oh, it looks like a princess bed.
 Totally does love it, which means muggy mugs now has his bunk bed.
 Yeah.
 So he's all excited about that because that's just so much cooler than just one bed.
 So it's a bedroom win for everybody.
 Yes.
 These are the type of things I'm sure you're desperate to hear about each week when you
 tune in.
 Well, on the way home from church today.
 They were discussing how because I'm going away this week and they have a plan to intermittently get to sleep with you in your great big bed.
 Have they come up with a schedule?
 Well, they haven't quite yet, but they're seeing they're leaning towards the weekend.
 Each one of them getting a turn to sleep in the king's eyes bed with you.
 But then they've decided they're going to sleep over in each other's rooms, whoever isn't with you to make it an exciting evening for everyone.
 Oh my gosh.
 So you're going to have fun.
 Plans and better plans.
 There you go.
 All right, let's talk about the topic for this week.
 Yes, the topic of this week is actually what you've been teaching on at M&amp;A for the last
 couple of weeks.
 And you've just started doing a three week series for Gray Center on Sunday mornings.
 Yeah, it's really funny because I'd mentioned on the podcast that I've been teaching the
 series to emanate all by blessing.
 And it's probably been one of the hardest things I've preached.
 Not that it's difficult content to understand, not that it's difficult content to produce,
 but there is so much resistance and seeming hostility.
 And I understand that because I felt in my own heart when preparing it, that delivering
 it was really hard.
 And I got to, I think last weekend, I was like, and I'm done.
 And I kind of threw in the towel and I was like, well, Lord, I was faithful.
 You asked me to preach three weeks on this.
 I'm done.
 And that was the Monday.
 And then on the Wednesday, Pastor Jeff calls and he's like, Hey, I think it'd be great
 if the main church heard that.
 Would you teach it?
 And I was like, So this morning was killer.
 It was so good, babe.
  </li><li>Well, you sleep with me, you have to say that.
  </li><li>No, I'm telling you, I got text messages
 from a whole bunch of people saying how good it was.
  </li><li>That's very kind.
 Well, people were very gracious
 in allowing me to poke the eyeballs, basically.
  </li><li>I like that Jeff sort of set it up
 with this whole thing about wisdom is part of wisdom
 is to allow yourself to be persuaded.
 And to basically be teachable.
 And so he sort of challenged all of us
 before he started speaking
 to allow ourselves to be persuaded.
 So that was really good too.
  </li><li>It is funny 'cause I taught this morning
 that there are a bunch of stuff as preachers
 that we can preach that never gets challenged.
 And the reason it never gets challenged
 is it doesn't really affect our life one way or another.
 Now that sounds ridiculous, but for example,
 if I teach on the need to be humble,
 every like, yeah, totally agree with that.
  </li><li>I agree, yeah, there's no chat, yeah.
  </li><li>But there isn't a humbleometer out there
 where we can gauge whether we are,
 to what degree of humility are we?
 We're finally going to talk about how there's a need to be telling the truth.
 Everybody agrees with that and everybody's fine with that.
 But whenever you teach on something like physical healing or blessing, people present
 the same sort of arguments.
 And it's only natural if, for example, you've never seen a miracle, if you've never seen
 anybody get healed, or if indeed you have been sick for a long period of time, hearing
 that God wants you well automatically presents a bunch of questions before you even accept
 that truth. Right.
 Rather than going, that's amazing. That's the truth. I would love to be healed. We go,
 Oh, yeah, well, if that's true, why'd my mother die of cancer? Oh, yeah, well, if
 that's true, why am I not healed? And we don't take it as a truth to be received. We take
 it as a lie to be defended. And so we just rush in with all these arguments of what
 we do, we do, we do. And so when you teach on blessing, as soon as you start talking
 about how God wants you to be blessed, like if I said on this podcast, you know, guys,
 want you to be holy. Nobody would put up a fight because, A, we don't really have a grid for what
 holiness is. We do. But what I mean is nobody's challenged by that. If I say God wants you to be
 financially blessed, then instantly people are going to challenge that. And I think that's really
 funny because both holiness and financial blessing are both represented in the scriptures.
 Yeah. I think it's funny too, because like you were saying, we're so, our experience determines
 so much of what we believe the Bible and what we sort of, what we take in and what we throw away
 or what we set aside or don't delve into or whatever, like the Bible is subject to our experience
 rather than our experience being subject to the Bible. Right. Yeah. Which to clarify just in case
 you're new to our podcast, AJ is not saying that the Bible is subject to our experience. What she's
 saying is we tend to read the Bible with a filter based on our experience. Right. The Bible is the
 word of God and is the benchmark for all of our life. But my comment this morning was we
 tend to read the Bible in a vacuum. We tend to know way more of the Bible than we are actually living.
 And I think the challenge for us this year has been kind of putting our money where our mouth is.
 Like, okay, we say we live by biblical values. Let's do it. Let's be as biblically based as we can
 in regards to our giving, in regards to our trust of God, in regards to yes.
 I've reading Exodus this morning, and you know, the Lord comes to Moses and
 1000 go speak to Pharaoh.
 And he doesn't say yes.
 He says here's all the reasons why that won't work.
 Right.
 Which is what we all do, isn't it?
 This is what we all do.
 And I'm like, OK, God, I'm determined just to give you my yes.
 Not my reasons why it won't work, not my objections, not my ask for clarification.
 Just a yes.
 like, I want the rest of my life to be 100% just obedient to God. And that revelation isn't new
 from previous years, but I realize in previous years, I am slow to respond for fear of being
 deceived. And I'm like, I've got no time for deception. I just want other obedience to God.
 Yeah. Well, babe, correct me if I'm wrong. But kind of the whole thing started with the Lord
 challenging you with a question at the beginning of the year that we started, you know, sort of
 discussing and pondering about what would it look like for your life to be blessed?
 Right. Which is such a strange question.
 Yeah.
 Because are you kidding me? Look at our life. Like just at a basic level, we have jobs,
 we have enough money to feed ourselves, we have a house, we have a healthy children,
 of course, blessed. Right. Yes. Of course, we're right.
 Not only that, we have a really next standard of living. Not only that, we're really healthy.
 we have TVs and all the modern luxuries that you need. Of course we are. So the fact that God
 would ask that question, got me thinking like, Lord, what are you going after? Right. Have I not
 been grateful? Have I not expressed gratitude? Am I taking this for granted? Do I not think I'm
 blessed? I hope that's not the case. And I have a sneaking suspicion that what God was going after
 is we tend to classify blessing according to our metric rather than God's.
 So what I mean by that is we, I feel like I will set a limit on what is reasonable and what's not
 reasonable. And in my research, I would say everybody determines the level of blessing that's on their
 life. So everybody thinks that what they have is an appropriate amount from God. Because if you
 you didn't, you'd have more or you would have less.
 Yeah.
 So then that got me thinking, well, what is God's perspective of blessing?
 Yes.
 And you know, what I discovered in scripture is is astonishing.
 It really is.
 It made me sort of think about, I remember when I was a kid and, you know, my
 grandparents are absolutely amazing and they're now at home with the Lord.
 I was going to say, aren't they dead?
 Yes.
 You were to be rather unpleasant.
 I was sorry.
 They were.
 I was like, they were.
 Absolutely amazing.
 But I remember my grandmother used to make a point of the difference between need and want.
 And so like if you went up to her and say, "Grandma, I need a cookie."
 She'd say, "You don't need a cookie.
 You want a cookie."
 And you can occasionally ask for a want, but you can feel free to ask for a need.
 And so I remember always just sort of having to really think about if there was something
 that my heart was leaping at, well, is it a want or a need?
 And is it okay to ask for a rant?
 Or should we really only be asking for needs?
 As long as I have rice and beans, really my needs are covered.
 And anything more than that really is a want, and so don't be selfish.
 And in the light of enormous suffering that's going around the world, how dare you move
 beyond that?
 Yeah.
 It's a very, very reasonable argument.
 But it's not actually the one that God is presenting.
 I'm sure I've mentioned this before.
 I remember having family come and stay.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And we weren't showing our family anything,
 we're just driving around a neighborhood.
 And I remember we were driving past
 some really nice houses.
 And one of my family members was just like,
 look at those houses, they are disgraceful.
 I was like, I think they're quite pretty.
 And they're like, nobody needs a house that big.
 And I was like, oh, actually,
 there's some of the people that live in the house,
 they can't be believers is what this person said.
 They cannot be believers.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It is immoral to have a house that size.
 So somewhere along their line,
 their level of blessing is drawn at a certain level
 and anything above that is wasteful.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But my point was, hey, if somebody's from the slums
 of India comes and looks at your house.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Your house is massive and obscene compared to them.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Like, you know, wait, all your children
 have a separate bedroom and my house,
 everybody lives in one bedroom.
 So there is a sliding scale
 And of course, there's huge cultural implications
 of all those things.
 But when you look at scripture,
 the Lord is above and beyond any level
 of abundance you can think of,
 which makes everything uncomfortable.
  </li><li>Sure, sure it does.
 I mean, I think that's been one of the realizations
 since we've started processing,
 since January's realizing that the tie in with blessing
 Blessing can equate to shame if your poverty minded.
 So that again, so blessing can end up with you living from a place of shame.
 If you're still poverty minded, because you don't think you deserve what you have.
 Right.
 So having the realization that and we've talked about it on the podcast before, for
 example, here we are in this amazing house that there's like no earthly way.
 We should have been able to have.
 And here we are and we're blessed and we get up every morning and look around and go,
 "Oh my gosh, I can't believe we live here.
 I can't believe this is our house."
 Right.
 But still feeling like a level of, "I'll speak for myself," like I should apologize.
 You know, for- Well, because you're a pastor.
 Because I'm a pastor because, you knowYou'
 re not allowed nice things.
 Whatever.
 Yeah, those things.
 So just being like all those thoughts that are totally not godly thoughts, but they seem
 like, well, they're probably more good religious thoughts, right?
 Right.
 And then, but realizing really all of that is shame.
 Right.
 All of the end.
 And actually it's hard to be shameful and thankful.
 So.
 Yeah.
 From a place of shame, it's hard to be like, Lord, thank you for this house.
 Thank you for this blessing and, and, you know, and also be apologetic.
 I've been reading this brilliant book.
 I highly recommend it.
 Lyle Phillips got me onto it.
 It's called the Blessed Life by Robert Morris.
 It is a fantastic book, but in it, he talks exactly about that dynamic that in our,
 if our hearts aren't healed, we either run to pride or shame.
 So God gives us something good and pride says, you know, someone's like, oh, my gosh,
 I love your shoes.
 And you're like, yeah, they're imported from Italy.
 And someone says, oh, my gosh, I like your shoes.
 And if you got shame, you're like, oh, I just, I got it at Target.
 Yeah, I got the money.
 All right.
 And and so pride is always trying to make you make others think that what you got is
 is better than what they are.
 And shame is so embarrassed that you have what you have that you're trying to
 excuse away the blessing.
 Yeah.
 So, you know, we've probably all been there where you meet a Christian who's got
 something nice and you point out something like a car, house, watch, whatever.
 and they begin apologizing for it or explaining how they got it,
 not in a way that honors God.
 Like, "Oh, yeah, God told you that."
 But trying to justify the fact that they have this nice thing.
 We have a friend who's a missionary.
 And one of the first times I met him, he had a beautiful Rolex watch.
 And so I asked about his watch and he said, "Oh, it was a family heirloom."
 You know, passed down to him from his family and I was like, "Oh, it's wonderful."
 And he's like, "Yeah, it is."
 But try raising mission support when you have a Rolex on your wrist.
 Everyone's like, "So you watch."
 Right.
 And so there's this whole thing of like, oh, if you're going to live according to the Lord,
 then you have to subject yourself to poverty.
 Now, is there going to be times that God asks you to sacrifice?
 Absolutely.
 Is there times when, is there going to be times when by living by faith you have lack
 because you're believing for abundance?
 Absolutely.
 But just I just even challenged a congregation this morning with this simple litmus test
 Do you think God would have things go well for you more than you'd have things go poorly for you?
 Right.
 And people were stumped because somewhere along the lines we thought, or I'll speak for myself,
 I've thought, well, God can't want things to go well for me because then I'll get big-headed.
 Which is assuming all kinds of strange things about your heart and character as well.
 And also about the power of Jesus.
 Yes.
 That Jesus is death and resurrection.
 It's sufficient to save me, but not keep me from being big-headed if God blesses me.
 Right.
 Like think about how small we've just made Jesus a sacrifice.
 Right. And I think too, like we know quite a few people that are very wealthy and very healthy in
 that wealth. And if you were to say to any of them, "Hey, I love your watch," they'd go, "Thank you."
 Right. Do you know what I mean? And there wouldn't be an explanation coming about
 where it came from or why they have it or do you know what I mean? Like that whole, so there's,
 It feels like they can just be comfortable and thankful in the blessing that God's placed them in.
 Right. I want to get there.
 I think the other funny dynamic, and I talked about this a little bit, is that as soon as you
 just even open a discussion on blessing, and this goes back to like, if you open a discussion on
 healing, like just like, yeah, I believe that God wants to heal the sick. But before that
 sentence is even finished, people are like, oh, yeah, well, then why haven't I been healed? Like,
 We jumped to that.
 Oh yeah, well, if God wants people healed,
 why are there hospitals?
 And we've just, we've just,
 we've not even heard the statement,
 the kernel of truth,
 this nugget of revelation from scripture
 before we've tried to stretch it to an example
 to prove our point that that can't be real.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I was asking the Lord, Lord, why do we do that?
 Like why are we so slow to learn?
 Why are we so threatened by revelation?
 And I felt that the Lord said, well,
 In regards to, like, so one of the famous things is, you know, you're talking about blessing and
 people then bring up poor people in Africa, poor Christians in Africa. Oh, so you're saying that
 poor Christians in Africa, we should all be millionaires. Is that what you're saying? I'm like,
 first of all, it's not what I'm saying. But second of all, it's interesting that you've taken a
 statement that God wants his children blessed and you've taken it and you've stretched it out of
 the context that we're talking to over way over here where that no longer fits. And you've done
 that so that you don't have to apply that truth to your own life.
 And I think that's the problem because when we begin talking about blessing, we either
 a quantify what we have and just say, oh, yes, I'm blessed and highly favored among the
 Lord.
 I mean, I remember meeting somebody and they're just, oh, I'm so blessed.
 And I'm like, you have neither food for your table or money for your bills.
 Like I'm really glad that you've got a great attitude.
 I'm really glad that you're persevering.
 But is this what God had in mind for you when Jesus died on across insufficiency?
 I don't think it is.
 And I think too, like when you say, does God want people orphans in Africa, blessed or
 whatever?
 I think, yes, he does.
 I mean, there's just a whole bunch of systems in place that that's not working out so well
 at the moment.
 You know what I mean?
 But I thinkWell, 
 I mean facetious because people are like, oh, you're saying they should all have
 Rolexes.
 I'm like, no.
 No.
 And neither were we saying we should all have Rolexes.
 It's just, you know, yeah.
 It is funny.
 I think when we talk about blessing highlights the lack in our life and we'll do anything
 we can't have the spotlight hidden away from lack.
 Well, also because there's stuff to own.
 If you're actually going to press into God for blessing, I think the problem is
 as soon as you make a bold statement, like God wants you to be blessed.
 It actually indicates the areas where we're not and we challenge it.
 Yeah.
 Bill Johnson, I had Bill and it's actually this is all Bill's fault because I heard
 him preaching in Toronto a number of years ago.
 And he said this without a theology of blessing, we condemn the poor to poverty.
 Wow.
 And I was like, Oh, that's amazing.
 And it comes back to that whole dichotomy where in the church today, we want people who
 seek first the kingdom of God, but we don't know what to do with people to whom
 all things have been added.
 Right.
 And I think we're coming to a place where actually God's manifestation of his blessing
 is going to become so visible that we actually have to do some leg work to actually create
 a landing strip for the blessing that he wants to give us.
 Yeah.
 I think too, like when I think about it, like just thinking about the people that we
 know that are very wealthy, like in the category of very wealthy, right?
 They're also probably the most incredible givers we know.
 Oh, undoubtedly.
 I mean, we haven't even got to that topic, but yeah, undoubtedly there's the people
 know who've learned to manage wealth brilliantly, have really applied the Lord to that area of wealth.
 Yeah. I was just thinking because I think is it, is it Bill who says about how we're blessed to be
 a blessing? Yeah. So that's, that's sort of what I was thinking about is like that statement about
 poverty and, and condemning them to poverty is like, well, actually, if we're, if we're walking
 and blessing and we're walking in God's kingdom in terms of giving away and generosity and all
 all that kind of stuff. That's how we shift things.
 Right. Well, as Bill's other line of, you can't reap more than you've planted.
 Right.
 And we'll just...
 Brittle.
 Just brutal, but brilliant.
 Yeah, it's great.
 You're never going to reap more than you've planted.
 Yeah. Anyway, these are just ideas that we're kicking around, aren't they, babe?
 Right.
 And I actually would really recommend you tuning in. If you haven't heard the teachings that
 Alan's been doing, just go and look up Grace Center. Can we link in the...
 Yeah, I'll put link in the show notes.
 I'm just doing next three weeks of Grace Center.
 The first week is already done.
 I'll put a link to that.
 Yeah, subsequent weeks will link to those.
 Yeah.
 I mean, honestly, I found it really challenging.
 And I've been with you in the process of it, but just, I really feel like the Lord is saying, hey, but what if?
 Well, it's important to know I've been challenged by the whole thing.
 I'm not up here going, guys, I've got it all sussed and you know, you unwashed masses.
 Just don't understand it.
 I'm every morning in the word wrestling with all this stuff.
 and God help me, help me overcome my unbelief. And just watching the Lord do incredible things,
 I'm shifting from a skeptic to somebody who feels like, okay, this is a message that the
 church needs to hear. And I am loving sharing it, despite the vulnerability that requires
 and the awkwardness that comes with sharing it. All right, you ready for a listening question?
 Sure.
 Just comes from Patrick.
 Patrick.
 He says, "I am single and wanting to find someone, but there is not an apparent answer
 from the Lord yet or anyone who interests me enough to ask out.
 I experience a good bit of anxiety and unrest about this issue.
 How can I cultivate rest in this season of life and how can I ensure that a desire is
 coming out of a healthy place?"
 How can you cultivate rest?
 I think it's that whole thing of song.
 Songs do not awaken love until it's so desires.
 I think if there's nobody on the scene
 and the Lord's not bringing enemy to it,
 go with that.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, and certainly don't panic.
 The deal is like, you know, God's really good.
 God's really, really good.
 And he loves to match us well.
 And so I would say if there isn't somebody
 that you're actually seeing and feeling like,
 oh gosh, that would be awesome.
 Don't panic, just keep working on yourself,
 keep working on stuff with the Lord, keep growing.
 And when that person comes along,
 then you'll be even more fit or more ready, if that makes sense.
  </li><li>Right.
 And as for anxiety, and this doesn't help for me,
 say, you know, be anxious for nothing,
 but scripture says, when Jesus says,
 who have you by worrying can have a single hour to your life?
 Like, so Patrick worrying is not going to speed up
 the bride that God has for you.
  </li><li>Right.
 hard to hear when you're watching other friends, you know, date or get married or whatever.
 But I mean, cultivating in rest is just as talent.
 I think speaking to yourself is hugely important.
 Self God's got this under control.
 And as for the desire coming out of a healthy place.
 I think God cares about the desires of your heart and some people that are single have
 desired to be single.
 And there that's what they have wanted.
 And then people that are married typically have desired to be married.
 So I don't know if you have to be so much concerned about that.
 I think my biggest thing would be if your heart is to be married and find a wife, take
 the time between now and then when you meet her to work on you.
 And in every area that the Lord highlights to you, start working on those things.
 Right. And the whole thing about how I don't know if my desires coming out of a healthy
 place, I think whenever there's not idolatry, there's a good sign that health is happening.
 So if you want the Lord more than you want to be married, you're in a great place.
 But if you're like, Lord, I want to be married and why are you not doing this? And I don't
 even know if you love me anymore.
 Yeah. You don't bring me a spouse. I'm out of here.
 Yeah. You've moved to idolatry. And that's how you know you're in an unhealthy place.
 Yeah.
 All right, Mrs. Jones?
 Yes, sir.
 gorgeous sunny afternoon.
 -It is. It's beautiful outside.
 -I want to jump on my bike.
 -Okay.
 -I want to get some points because I'm competing
 with a bunch of people.
 -How are you doing today?
 -Today I'm failing dismally.
 -They probably didn't preach to sermons this morning.
 -No, in your face.
 -Yes, that's right.
 -You don't get points for that in your Apple launch.
 -I know, right?
 You should just be more a demonstrative when preaching
 and you get more points.
 -Yes, right.
 -Two things for you to think about this week.
