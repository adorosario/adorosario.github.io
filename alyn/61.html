<p> Welcome to episode 61 of keeping up with the Jones you send all official like a newsreader.
 Thank you I was going to throw in a jingle but I know how you're banning me from jingles you know what's new this week.
 What's new this week I've been getting up super early you have been getting up super early and i don't think super early for normal people.
 It's just super early for me.<br/>
 What's probably super early for a lot of people.
 I've been taking advantage of the fact that I was jell at.
 And I've forgotten how much I enjoy waking up before everybody else does.
 Okay, do tell.<br/>
 Well, I got this app on my phone called Sleep Cycle.
 And the premise of the app is that you plug your phone in.
 You set the time that you would like to wake up at.
 And then you put the phone beside your pillow, not under your pillow, not underneath the sheets or anything like that.
 Just rest it beside, on your bed beside your pillow.
 and then it will monitor through the accelerometer on your phone how restless you are and where you are in your sleep cycle.
 And the idea is that if you want to get up at say seven a.m.
 You give a window to wake you up typically half an hour and it won't wake you up any later than seven a.m.
 But sometime between six thirty and seven it will just monitor and when you're at your lightest period it will just wake you up.
 Now, it sounds like hocus pocus, but based on the facts of my experience, it's absolutely awesome.
 Based on five days of experience, it's absolutely awesome.
 It is.<br/>
 And here's the other thing I've noticed.
 It doesn't actually matter what time you wake up at.
 Okay.<br/>
 And what I mean by that is I've woken up at nine a.m.
 before and felt groggy.<br/>
 I've also woken up at 5.30am like I have this week and felt super alert.
 So it's not the time of when you wake up.
 It's probably how you wake up and how much sleep you've had before.
 Yes, I agree.<br/>
 I remember when I was a teenager, my friend Andy Wallace and I had this job
 where we would open up a not a coffee shop, what do you call it?
 Candy shop.<br/>
 A candy shop, a news agent, a newspaper store.
 and we would open the store at 6am which meant i woke up at 5.30am every day of the week Monday
 Monday through Saturday. Yeah i would have been 13 years old. I started working at 13.
 Okay. And worked there for five years. Wow. So for five years, six days a week,
 I'd get up at 5.30. I'd get dressed. You worked before school for five days a week.
 5.30 am and be home at 8 am.<br/>
 And there was something magical about being awake before everybody else was.
 Is it because you think you know something because you're the only one awake?
 Yeah, you feel like you're in a secret world.
 Did I say secret world or secret world?
 You said secret, but I think we all understand you mean secret.
 It is like you're in a secret world.<br/>
 I used to love it and then you'd get home at 8 am and my family was just kind of
 waking up at 8 am, but I felt like I had a head store in the world.
 And I forgot how much I loved it.<br/>
 And now here you are in your secret world again.
 Well, the other cool thing about this particular app is if you have Philips Hue,
 which every self-respecting geek should have, Philips Hue for those...
 It is possible there's no one geek listening to this show, but yes.
 So a Philips Hue light bulb is a Wi-Fi enabled light bulb that can display 16 million colors.
 So we have a bunch of them in our house.
 In this particular case, I have them in our bedside table lights.
 This little app will wake you up using the light bulbs and simulate a sunrise.
 It's the first alarm.<br/>
 You don't look impressed, but it's the first alarm I've ever had that I don't hate.
 Well, because I'm experiencing the other part of it, which is I'm on a different sleep cycle than you.
 And I experience not so much the Philips Hue waking me up as the light from the bathroom,
 making me up or you stumbling around trying to find your running shorts at
 five twenty in the morning. But typically you fall back to sleep again and I know
 that based on my research because I come in and you're like... First of all, there's
 no way you make it in the door without waking me up. So... You're drunk that
 with your tree. You don't know what you're doing. Nice trying. You called me
 our president the other day. I did not. You did. I walked in the room and you're
 like, "We've held Presidente!"<br/>
 Where the liars go again?<br/>
 Where am I?<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 Anyway, waking up felt absolutely amazing, and I've been loving it, and I've been taking
 advantage of that, of going for a run.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And by...<br/>
 A run, I mean.<br/>
 And by run, I mean a brisk walk.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 And now I walk two miles every morning.
 That's awesome.<br/>
 It's really good.<br/>
 And anyway, it's amazing.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Feet on the floor before six a.m. changes your life.
 Yes.<br/>
 He said, I've been done it for five days.
 We'll see what next week is like.<br/>
 Well, technically you didn't even do it for five days because you took Friday off.
 So you did it for four days.<br/>
 But what did I hate about Friday?<br/>
 Um, that we didn't have enough tacos?<br/>
 No, that I didn't wake up.<br/>
 I just thought, no, actually, because then you did it again on Saturday.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And I love it because you woke me up early on Saturday.
 Yeah, I love it.<br/>
 Let it go.<br/>
 Tell me about the rest of your week.<br/>
 Well, why do you sound like you're fast asleep?
 You sound like you're reading a children's story.
 Well, no one's.<br/>
 The bunny off the cross history and was eaten by the large dinosaur.
 I spoke in every day.<br/>
 What do you speak of?<br/>
 I spoke on essentially using the character of Josiah talking about.
 You're going to have to be getting audible level because I'm not a dog.
 and I can't hear you. So speak loudly.
 I spoke on Josiah. Good.<br/>
 Great. But destiny. There we go. That's a little bit more.
 And the kids were in PBS all week this week. Vacation Bible School. Yes, with Jeff's water.
 Who Tia wants to marry? Yes. I think she may have moved on.
 yeah we did have a discussion about who she wants to marry now this is my six year old daughter yes.
 Who decided she wants to marry somebody because he's kind so we're teaching her to love yeah.
 Which is very sweet no more Disney movies for the six year no the big brown eyes talking about her true love like we're in so much travel.
 Your mom is in town she is she got here last Sunday so she's been here week any awesome stories about your mom.
 I took her to experience a hundred layer donut and what was her feedback she i said isn't it kind of like eating a baby angel and she's like oh my goodness i'm so glad i can't buy these where i live.
 And she love the drip coffee from honest rest we just got like normal drip coffee course i didn't i got a cuban but.
 She just sat there and drank it.<br/>
 you know like she drew it out for two hours and just kept talking about it.
 I think it's interesting that i don't like coffee.
 Interesting how well everybody else that i greatly respect drinks coffee or tea nope just coffee okay.
 I mean the people i respect a tea drinker.
 What i mean is the people i am inspired by the people i really like the people who i follow on instagram.
 That's because awesome people drink coffee.
 And that's my point.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 I'm awesome, but without the coffee.<br/>
 What would I be like with coffee?<br/>
 Probably more awesome.<br/>
 What am I missing?<br/>
 The awesomeness of coffee drinking.<br/>
 It tastes--<br/>
 Be very careful.<br/>
 Not right to me.<br/>
 Oh.<br/>
 It's probably something I could train you to do, darling.
<strong>[LAUGHING]</strong><br/>
 It's just that you need a coffee education.
 OK.<br/>
 Maybe that's true.<br/>
 It's true.<br/>
 Because here's the thing.<br/>
 You grew up in the UK, where they drink what?
 Instant coffee.<br/>
 Yes, that's right.<br/>
 That invention from the culinary pits of hell
 known as instant coffee.
</p><ul>
  <li>That's true. - Horrible.
  </li><li>Nest coffee.
  </li><li>Ugh, revolting.
  </li><li>I had to make, when I was back in the UK last week,
 my aunt and uncle came over,
 and I was being the good host for the most,
 and said, "You know, can I make it gonna be tea or coffee?"
 Which is a fatal mistake, 'cause I drink neither.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so. - How can I make you
 something I have no idea what it's supposed to taste
 or look like? (laughs)
 So my aunt did say, no, I can help you.
 And I was like, please, I think I know how I make tea and coffee.
 And then I got in the kitchen was like, wait,
 so how do you make this stuff?
 But there was no instructions on the side of the Nest Cafe
 jar on how to make--
 Just because it shouldn't be ingested.
 It's so terrifying.
 I would like to do a blind taste test with you,
 with a Nest Cafe variant and a normal drip coffee
 to see if you can tell the difference.
 Oh, babe.
 Just even that you can make that statement
 just shows your coffee ignorance that needs to be educated.
  </li><li>I'm willing to be educated.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I just don't like the taste of it.
 So find me something I like the taste of.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>But do I really want an addictive substance in my body?
 I mean, I have enough of them.
  </li><li>I was like, why not?
 You can just add it to the coffee, the Coke, the sweet tea.
 Chocolate.
  </li><li>I like to think of them as health supplements though.
  </li><li>Wow.
 Okay.
 I'm not sure if I've mentioned this, but it's so good.
 It's worth the double mention.
 But I have, I know I'm sure I mentioned this
 'cause you said you didn't like it.
 The fish tacos at Sapphire Restaurant in the factory.
  </li><li>Yeah, well, you've had them twice.
 I only had them once and I thought they were dry.
  </li><li>But I re-had them this week and you were jealous.
  </li><li>I didn't try them but they smelled very good.
  </li><li>You did?
  </li><li>I know you tried the potatoes.
 They have twice roasted potatoes.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Those would be mine doing
 if I could get ahold of them on a regular basis.
  </li><li>I'm gonna go back for them this week.
  </li><li>You are.
  </li><li>All right, and then we saw Ant-Man this week.
  </li><li>We did see Ant-Man this week.
  </li><li>Give me your view of Ant-Man.
  </li><li>Well, he's very small and he wears a red outfit.
 He's very hard to view 'cause he's tiny,
 but he packs a punch.
 No, it was really good.
 I was sort of like, oh, I don't know.
 It sounds kind of lame.
 I don't remember hearing about Ant-Man
 the whole Marvel cinema universe.
 I used to read comics about when I was little, but you made a great point.
 So that game, but later, you made a fantastic point.
 Your fantastic point was basically with the Marvel people, you can at least trust the brand.
 Right.
 They, they put out great movies and you, you know, you had compared it to the
 guardians of the galaxy that it's supposed to be kind of funny, kind of lighthearted, but
 still a superhero movie, that kind of thing.
 And it was exactly like that.
 It was great.
 And that was the point I made about the power of a brand.
 So both of Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man,
 both based on obscure comics.
 And by that, I mean, everyone's heard of Batman
 and Superman and Spider-Man.
 Nobody'd heard of at least non-comic nerds
 hadn't heard of Ant-Man or Guardians of the Galaxy.
 And yet we went to see both of them based on the value that we'd learnt to acquire from
 watching other Marvel movies.
 Right.
 So we figured if they were good at that, they're going to be good at this and right
 enough, they were.
 And there's a lesson there for church planting, which I haven't really thought about yet.
 So you're just going to have to hold up on that church planters.
 There's a lesson in there for you.
 Well, we're not going to share.
 I think there's a lesson in there for everybody about the power of the brand.
 But I'm not qualified to talk on that.
 Okay.
 Margiponk creative conference this weekend.
 Great conference.
 Tell me all about it.
 It was just really good talking a lot about the tabernacle of David.
 I really loved.
 He sort of broke down the difference between Solomon's tabernacle, Moses's tabernacle,
 and the tabernacle of David and how, you know, scripture talks about God's heart to restore
 the tabernacle of David.
 And when he went into that, he's like, you know, the tabernacle of David, there was no
 veil.
 There was no distance between man and God and whatever.
 So I mean, he talked about a ton of stuff, but I think the main thing I took out of it
 was just another little nugget about how much God wants to be close to us.
 But he also talked a lot about creativity and, you know, God being creative and us being
 made in his image and being able to step into that creativity.
 So it was great.
 And on the topic of creativity, how amazing was worship as we can?
 So good.
 Absolutely unbelievable.
 So good.
 Didn't matter.
 Who was leading worship?
 It was all awesome.
 Didn't matter.
 No.
 Just incredible.
 And this morning's worship was just off the charts.
 That's fantastic.
 And I loved this morning we had Sarah on one side and Elena on the other side both dancing
 throughout all of worship.
 And it just, I don't know, it was amazing.
 This morning wasn't amazing.
 I keep joking about me dancing because it's an easy joke to make.
 But I am watching all the dances in our church begin to dance.
 And I'm watching people like Elena and Sarah, you know, just such an anointing on them to
 dance that is drawing something out of me that nobody needs to be scared.
 But it is like this is...
 I'm going to start wearing steel toe shoes.
 There is just this amazing anointing that's released in worship when our dance assessor
 dancers dance.
 They're dance assessors?
 I just made that up.
 Well, I didn't make up.
 I borrowed the term.
 We did dancers.
 But it is incredible.
 You know, it's the same when we have our painters painting during worship.
 There's our painterscessors.
 Our painterscessors are dance assessors.
 Our beatbox assessors.
 Yeah.
 I mean, it is the same.
 It's funny to me.
 It feels like sometimes it feels like, you know, you're at this place and you're, it's
 not like you're stuck, but it feels like worship is hit a plateau.
 And then somebody like Elena will get up or even Alice in on the violin or whatever.
 And it's like they're can opener for the Holy Spirit.
 Like all of a sudden we just shoot right through that barrier into, you know, just go to a
 deeper place.
 Incredible.
 Well done, Chris and our worship team.
 You guys did an awesome job.
 Our topic for this week.
 Nothing more than feeling.
 A topic very close to my heart.
 Yes.
 Because I've been having lots of feelings this week.
 You do.
 You have lots of feelings.
 We could talk about your donut feelings.
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong>
 There's something real about feelings and comfort
 and donuts, isn't there?
 I have found that donuts are a very effective grieving tool.
 Really?
 Mm-hmm.
 And chocolate and video games.
 No, I really want to talk about feelings this week.
 And a lot of probably what we're going to share was taught to us by Dan
 Farley from Bethel Church in running California.
 Dan's come out a couple of years in a row now to teach in our school.
 And he's just this great teacher, but his teaching on feelings, especially
 was, was superb and very, very helpful.
 But what I'm finding funny is I'm having, you know, obviously for those
 of you who are new, my mom died two weeks ago. And so, you know, when I overdid the funeral,
 I think I taught last week about how the momentum of all the events just carried me through,
 and I don't really have to feel anything. And now that I'm back, and I'm back in normal
 life. I'm aware of all these feelings, and it's quite an unusual feeling for me to feel
 these feelings because normally I'm usually not driven by my feelings.
 Yes. And this week I have been.
 And typically when you start feeling things, then you start analyzing what you're feeling
 because you're unused to feeling things.
 Right.
 And if you're not careful, you'll come to wrong conclusions because they seem real.
 They seem real, but don't believe everything you feel is a very good life motto.
 I think somewhere along the line, we can be tricked into thinking that we are what we
 feel.
 And actually our feelings are just a part of us right and you can change your feelings quite easily and they're not meant to be the dominant part of you right.
 Yeah.
 So I'm having fun this week having it feels like I'm getting home with the rest of my life and somewhere over to my right are some feelings are convincing me to try and feel the way they're talking.
 And most of the feelings are quite negative feelings.
 And i think thanks to dance teaching thanks to a bunch of inner healing i'm realizing it's not gonna be a great turn if i partner with those negative feelings.
 Right i think i'm not an expert in this but i think bro because i'm in the grieving season i would say lots of my feelings are hugely amplified and that's the trick that's kind of like the way i feel like.
 the enemies over playing his hand in the feelings i'm being offered to feel.
 Are so much larger than life and so ridiculous i'm thinking i don't think that's healthy to go over there.
 Right that make sense yeah so for example.
 So for example i'll be sitting minding my own business doing something like i've got a project coming up at work and i'm just throwing myself into that quite grateful for the project to help me.
 Hide well, not necessarily hide but have a focus. I mean, you know something to get focused on so I'll be focused on
 You know this particular thing and kind of over to my right hand side will be this overwhelming feeling of something absurd like
 You know what fine. I'm done with this and I'm gonna move to China, you know, just something so ridiculous
 Then like oh okay, you know something's going on somebody's trying to get my attention
 Yeah, so that's a thought that's trying influence my feeling sometimes. It's a feeling sometimes it's
 I might be feeling sleepy, but instead of being sleeping. It's like I'm exhausted. It's like I'm a teenager
 You know everything is magnificent everything is magnified and then my reactions
 I'm aware of are hugely magnified now
 Thankfully, I'm remembering that I don't have to control other people, but I can't exercise self control
 so my desire to like I've had a couple of funny interactions with
 servers
 Where they'll ask me a question and because I am so
 Maybe fro or stretched out. I'm super literal and I'm realizing this thing could escalate really really quickly because I'm
 There's a temptation of being really really short. Just like step away from the server
 I had many such run-ins after my dad died.
 Really?
 Yeah, I didn't process it.
 Yeah, I didn't process it as well as you are.
 So I just would snap at people.
 Like they would come up and be like, oh, you're talking to somebody.
 Why are you crying?
 My father died.
 I'm sorry.
 Why did you do it?
 Like I'd be totally like, you know, and people I'm with are like, sorry, you know.
 And I didn't see what the problem was at the time.
 Our friend Alina from Switzerland, and this morning she brought me a bag of chocolate
 that had been handmade by a Swiss chocolate ear.
  </li><li>Health.
  </li><li>No, no, no.
 And she said, "Here's a bag of chocolate."
 Because I made a joke yesterday that chocolate is a great grieving tool, so she brings him
 with chocolate.
  </li><li>Just therapeutic chocolate.
  </li><li>And so I opened up and I'm eating a piece, and somebody next to me said, "Can I have
 a piece of chocolate?"
 I was like, "Why did your mum die too?"
  </li><li>That was me.
 You wouldn't share it with me.
 I'm grieving too, you know.
 It was my therapeutic chocolate too.
 but I wasn't trying to be funny. It was just like the literal logical step, you know,
 so I'm thinking, okay, I'm having to put a wide buffer between me and other people.
 Who might not quite understand you at this moment.
 Right. But here's a good thing. You don't need to be afraid of feelings, like even these extreme
 feelings, because they do come and go like, as being members of my family, and they were talking
 about how grief is like a wave. And you know, like right now I'm talking to you, I'm laughing
 about it. I feel completely fine. I don't feel a wreck. I don't feel like I'm grieving.
 I don't feel sad. I feel quite happy.
 Later, you might want to punch a baby seal. I mean, you just never know.
 That's the thing, because feelings, they come and they go, and mostly they're temporary.
 I've found that I can change how I'm feeling by talking about them, by sharing my feelings,
 by eating a bar chocolate, by going to sleep, by going for a run, by running, I mean a walk.
 walk, by a walk you mean a stroll. But now you can do any of those things. Here's the
 lesson that Dan taught us that it seems like most people using Facebook have yet to learn.
 And that is having a feeling is reasonable, but expressing it may not be. I just read
 Facebook post over I came up here where this person had written a five point rebuttal to
 somebody who more than likely is not going to read the Facebook post. So he's posted
 to the rest of the world except the very person that needs to hear it. And I was like, dude,
 like seriously.
 Why was it to the president?
 No.
 Don't get me started on that one.
 Sorry. And the thing is too, I mean, when you're going through grief, you need to be
 be able to give yourself the grace and the space to feel how you feel and go through
 it. But you're still a person who lives around other people who they still matter to and
 their feelings matter and their needs matter. And so you're not grieving in a bubble. You're
 grieving around other people. You know, like you're, you have the challenge of, which I
 never had, you're grieving, but you have kids around you who still need a daddy who
 still, you know, they love you, they want to touch you or give you a cuddle or give you
 a kiss or whatever.
 I mean, for whatever reason, there's plenty of grace for that.
 I think the harder thing is, I'm also a public figure.
 And so I'm realizing that some things that demand an emotional input from me, I don't
 have grace for and this week certainly.
 Here's a simple example. We went to the movie theater to watch Ant-Man as we've already
 mentioned. And loved Ant-Man. It was an hour and a half of sheer nonsense. It was light-hearted.
 I laughed out loud. It was really therapeutic. The previews before it were not good. They
 were all hydramma. And I was just about in tears over fiction. I mean, that's not how
 I'm wired, but almost in tears about these fictional, overly emotional situations.
 Of course, being a pastor, for example, at church this morning, I could not be on ministry
 team.
 I mean, I'm sure I could have, but Jeff was very gracious in not asking me to be.
 But the thought of interacting with people on a deeply emotional level, that would not
 have been a pretty sight, I don't think.
 And so, you know, there's plenty of other areas I can serve in church, but that's one
 thing I'm aware of.
 And I'm sure that, you know, of course that will calibrate itself.
 It's my first week back.
 But that's a funny thing for me as well,
 'cause normally I'm not aware of that.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
 What about your whole thing about your head will lie to you,
 but your body won't explain that?
  </li><li>Well, again, that was taught to us by Dan.
 It's a great, a great lying.
 Usually your body will bring to light what you need to know.
 So usually, especially if you're a high functioning,
 for example, in that particular situation.
 Like if you're, so in my situation,
 I've got a really understanding church community,
 understanding boss. But if I was a high-powered lawyer and I'm being paid
 thousands of dollars an hour to do something, I don't have the luxury of
 crying and the you know while interviewing a witness in the court case. I just have
 to suck up and get on with all my jobs. So there's a danger if you live like
 that and you exercise high levels of self-control that you can delude yourself
 and if thinking you're not feeling things or things aren't affecting to you.
 And that's that whole thing of your your head will lie to you. No I'm not
 nervous. I'm anxious, but your body won't.
 Your stomach is turning.
 My stomach is turning.
 I can't sleep at night.
 Right.
 And so usually there's some indicators in, in the way that
 you're wired indicates your, your heart is crying for attention.
 So for example, being unable to sleep, losing your appetite, losing
 your sex drive.
 Not that that's your problem for you.
 Well, what I mean is that there'll be, you know, I remember a couple of weeks
 go, I go up to speak and I speak for a living. I am rarely ever nervous speaking. But I noticed
 I got up to speak and I was halfway through my sermon, I'm like, I can't do this. And what that
 tells me is my body is telling me something my head is trying to ignore. So paying attention to
 physical symptoms in your body is hugely important for your for the longevity of your your life.
 And the great thing for us is we're surrounded by people that get it.
 Right.
 So we could literally turn around and say, I'm just not able to do this right now.
 And it would get covered, which is lovely.
 I remember when Dan was here, he said this, he said, "Crisis, pain and loss are not optional in this life."
 And if you close yourself to these, you close your heart to opportunity, joy and love.
 These are experienced in the same spot in your heart and God often works in them to shape us.
 Yeah.
 And this is why we take notes people because when he taught that, I wasn't facing any crisis or pain or loss.
 So like, that's a great point.
 But you write it down so that when you are in a season of crisis pain and loss, you're like,
 what did he say about that?
 And you know, you can hold on to that.
 Incidentally, that's also why the Word of God is written down.
 So that when you're facing anything, it hasn't changed.
 That's right.
 He's still there. He's still the same God. He still has the same promises. He still has
 the same amount of love and comfort for you.
 And that's what's amazing about the presence of God. You can bring your feelings to God
 and say, "God, I'm feeling this. What's the truth about it?" And that is an absolute
 vital thing to do.
 God is not threatened by your feelings.
 No. And what was glorious this morning, I think for me personally, my worship was so
 amazing this morning. We probably spent a good 45 minutes singing the same song over and
 over and over and it was all about the goodness of God. Not that I doubt the goodness of God at
 all and not that I feel like my mom dying as any impact on the goodness of God, but having this
 truth and not just singing the truth but getting in touch with the truth of God's goodness and
 allowing the Holy Spirit to minister to your feelings is so powerful. Oh yeah, it's amazing.
 I think we have a couple of options when we're feeling negative emotions. One is to ignore it,
 which just is set in a time bomb, exactly. The other is to believe it, which isn't helpful.
 Well, because then you're going to partner with it.
 Right. And the last is to acknowledge it and just submit it to God and just say,
 God, does that feel? Could you give me your perspective?
 Yeah, I need some help here.
 And he's just so good at trading your sorrows for joy.
 He's so good at that. A garment of praise instead of a spirit of heaviness.
 Yeah, those are real things.
 Ah, it's amazing.
 And that's the kind of stuff when you do go through grieving, that if you haven't been
 through something like that before you realize how real that stuff is.
 That's not pretty language.
 That's a real exchange that God makes that makes the difference.
 And we have a thoughts on feelings.
 I was just thinking when I was away with YWAM, and this would have been in '93, beginning
 of '94.
 So it was about three years after my dad died.
 One day, one morning, got up and was in touch with grieving for the first time.
 I had just shoved it down for three years.
 And I was instantly angry.
 I can't remember which I know there's like five phases of grieving.
 I'm sure anger is not the first one.
 Chocolate doughnuts.
 Yeah, right.
 For your games.
 Anger and then.
 But I was instantly in touch with anger and I didn't know what to do.
 And I remember going to the bass leaders and them just saying, "AJ, give God your anger."
 And I was like, "That's not okay."
 actually, I'm partially angry at him. You know, I'm partially angry at God. And the
 bass leaders were like, "Well, then talk to him about that." He knows how you feel
 already anyway. And he's not threatened by your anger. So just go ahead and talk to
 him. And I remember thinking, "Gosh, I've never thought that was okay." But the truth
 is, if you're a great dad, you have an open relationship with your kids. You know, you
 want them to be able to tell that you how they feel so you can help them process that correctly
 and work it through. And God's no different than that. He's just way better at it.
 So I guess my thoughts are whatever your feelings are, they're safe with God.
 They're probably not safe in your own head being regurgitated over and over again,
 but they're safe to give to God and ask what he wants to do with them. What exchange he wants to make.
 Brilliant, babe.
 Well, should we go have a nap?
 Special naps?
 Mm-hmm.
 Well, whatever.
 Is that on your list of five things?
 Donuts, special naps.
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong>
 Nothing like a special cuddle to just make everything all OK.
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong>
 You're adorable.
 Mm-hmm.
 That's true.
 Well, thank you for tuning in.
