<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is.
 Hello my plaid shirt wearing beauty.<br/>
 Hello my gray shirt wearing beauty.<br/>
 I just took a photo of you both of the 10s and you look so cute.
 Oh thanks.<br/>
 But I had to make it black and white because your shirt clashes with the color of our chair.
 Well actually technically my shirt has some orange in it.
 Your shirt is pink and purple.<br/>
 What's it doing with orange in it?<br/>
 It has some orange in it.<br/>
 That's a crime against humanity.<br/>
 Well, it's a great shirt and it works for the shirt.
 No doubt, it's a great shirt.<br/>
 I'm not denying that.<br/>
 But with our orange chair, it doesn't work too well.
 Well, I could see that.<br/>
 Let's do a rundown on this week.<br/>
 Well, the SOSL started this week.<br/>
 Woo-hoo!<br/>
 And you taught on hearing God's voice, which is...
 I did, but I taught Mark Verclers material.
 Warren Verkler who taught me how to hear God's voice.
 Yes.<br/>
 I have then gone on and taught his material around the world because it's, I don't know
 if a better step, four step process to hearing God's voice than marks.
 It is a very succinct way of learning how to hear God's voice.
 If you haven't heard that succinct way of hearing God's voice, we did a podcast on that
 way back when we were just in double digit podcasts.
 If you go to Alan, if you go to Alan and AJ.com/18, you'll be able to listen to that podcast.
 way back to 18. Michelle Vouter spoke at emanate on seeking God's strength.
 She didn't just speak. She absolutely killed it. She did kill it. It was fantastic. I was
 watching, you know, one aspect of her speaking is her slides. And I was watching her slides
 and I'm like, truly, the student has become the master.
 Her slide game is on point. Her slide game was ridiculous. I was like, okay, challenge
 accepted. So I think I'm going to hire Brad Pitt to do a photo shoot for my next just to
 come up a level.<br/>
 Okay. I don't remember seeing that in the budget. Brad's a friend of mine. We can wait
 back. So it should be fine Wednesday. My dad arrived. He did. What's it like having my
 dad in the house?<br/>
 It's great. He's a super low maintenance and very good with the kids and you know, reads
 them stories and is amused greatly by their antics.
 I just went to Whole Foods and brought the chocolate apocalypse home with me.
 And you're not supposed to eat any chocolate.
 I haven't been eating any of his chocolate.
 I've all been.<br/>
 It's all for him, but I think we can agree that I come by my sweet tooth.
 Honestly, you do.<br/>
 You may not be supposed to be eating chocolate, but did you want to confess
 anything you ate this afternoon?<br/>
 That's the point of this podcast.<br/>
 I come downstairs listeners from putting MJ to bed and Alan has this look on his
 face like he's trying to appear casual, which is my first sight.
 that he's eating something he's not supposed to eat.
 The second sign, of course, is the whipped cream that's still in the corner of his mouth,
 and he's trying to just casually act like he didn't just take a massive bite.
 -I liked the whole. -Cheese cake.<br/>
 But to be fair wasn't chocolate cheesecake.
 It was lemon meringue cheesecake.<br/>
 You're still not supposed to have it.<br/>
 Good lord.<br/>
 It was so worth the punishing looks I got from you.
 I don't know how the cheesecake factory can pour out liquid meringue.
 It is so good.<br/>
 What do you mean?<br/>
 Well, if somebody would bottle that, I'd bathe in this stuff.
 Oh gosh.<br/>
 It's like liquid marshmallow.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And before everybody writes in and tells me there's this thing called fluff in the grocery store.
 I know about fluff.<br/>
 It was practically my first purchase on bond to America.
 Oh, dear.<br/>
 But it isn't good.<br/>
 I don't know what the cheesecake factor and I don't know what culinary
 sorcerers they have going on there.<br/>
 That's probably what it is.<br/>
 But it was amazing.<br/>
 Lemon cheesecake.<br/>
 Yay, dad for that.<br/>
 The kids, of course, had Oreo and we're not willing to share.
 It's very tragic.<br/>
 Um, what else have been this week?<br/>
 We, oh, I got my iPhone.<br/>
 Yeah, you got your iPhone.<br/>
 I didn't get mine.<br/>
 Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da,
</p><ul>
  <li>Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.
  </li><li>What do you think about it?
 Give us your non-techy review of the iPhone 7.
  </li><li>My non-techy review is, it feels lighter.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I do know if it is lighter, but it feels lighter.
 And I like the new shade of the blue cover that I have.
  </li><li>Good, that's an important detail.
 (laughing)
 The camera, the camera seems better, it seems good.
  </li><li>It is a much better camera.
  </li><li>Yeah, but otherwise, I mean, I'm enjoying the stickers
 the new sort of things that it does.
 Let's talk about stickers.
 OK.
 I've I thought you have a sticker issue.
 I thought I'd be an old curmudgeon who just like, ah, stickers who needs those.
 But apparently I love stickers.
 Apparently I'm stickering everything again.
 Yes.
 If you text me, you are likely to get a barrage of stickers that more than you
 were expecting.
 I go into a sticker fight with Tink and that was a lot of fun.
 That's probably a person you don't want to stick your fight with.
 Well, the thing is she didn't know how you use them.
 Oh, so you're mine.
 No, well, basically for the first half an hour, I was like,
 "In your face, in your face."
 And then it got boring because she didn't know how to,
 so I talked her through how to do it and that was my downfall.
 Yeah, you never should have told her.
 No, she just, she just rapidly acquired new sticker packs.
 Yes.
 Let me ask you about the most controversial thing about the new iPhone.
 Okay, I'm ready.
 No headphone slot.
 I don't care.
 Okay.
 But baby, there's no headphone port on it.
 But they give you new headphones to plug into your phone and that's their new thing.
 Yeah, I totally agree.
 I've just been facetious.
 Yeah, I don't care.
 What about the fact that isn't a real button?
 And that's a little weird.
 The home button is weird.
 Yeah, it's a little weird.
 Do you know why it's weird?
 It's so that it is waterproof.
 No, it wasn't the angles going.
 It's weird because you didn't listen to me.
 You've got a setting to and only a barbaric lunatic would have anything other than
 setting three.
 Really? Well, when you get your phone, whenever that will be in a few months time, they finally come to Tennessee, you can set yours to number three.
 But for now, I will take my brand new phone and set it to two if I like.
 Okay, and it will feel weird for you, but I'm here offering you help.
 Okay.
 Just come to me.
 Thank you for all you who are unclean.
 And set it to setting three and you'll be fine.
 I don't want to.
 For those of you who don't know what we're talking about, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus doesn't actually have it does have a space for a home button, but it is an immovable button.
 and instead there's something called a Taptic Engine behind it.
 When you press the button, it kind of vibrates to make it feel like there's a button, which doesn't do a great job on.
 But they did it because it's waterproof.
 It does. Yeah, it's completely... Well, it's water resistant.
 I'm not sure it's waterproof, but yes, you can.
 I'm splitting here.
 Yeah. You could drop into Thailand and you'd be fine.
 See? Fantastic. I'm going to go try that now.
 My problem is that there are no iPhone 7 Plus's in Tennessee.
 They're really hard.
 That sounds strictly speaking true.
 You could have had a pink one.
 I could have a pink one, but yeah.
 And I don't even care about the fact that this pink, what I care about is that the front of it is white.
 Because real men can have a pink phone.
 I'd be fine with a pink phone.
 Babe, look at my phone.
 It's beautiful.
 And the front of it is white.
 No, I don't like it.
 I don't like the bezel being white.
 Why?
 Look how good that looks framed in black.
 No, mine looks so much better.
 But you're a too clicky person.
 Can I even trust your judgment?
 whatever, whatever.
 I went to the Apple store and they were very kind in letting me.
 Basically my argument was, look, there's no iPhone 7 Plus for T-Mobile, who's our carrier
 of choice, but you do have an iPhone 7 Plus for AT&amp;T and they're technically identical
 phones.
 And so they said, well, sir, we'd be happy to sell you an AT&amp;T one if you think it would
 work.
 But as soon as we started to check our process, it was tied to AT&amp;T's inventory and the only
 with it sell me is at full price.
 Sorry, did I bore you already?
 Yeah, I was a little bit.
 Okay, I'm so sorry.
 Sorry.
 I think maybe it was a sign that we should switch back to AT&amp;T.
 Well, I don't think you want to do that for so many reasons.
 Oh.
 Like having good signal.
 Well, the thing is we do get good signal with T-Mobile as long as we're not in a remote
 part.
 As long as you're in a city.
 Yeah.
 You don't have any stuff on the highways.
 But what's my backup plan for that?
 Okay.
 You're a nerd.
 My backup plan was to buy a Verizon mobile hotspot.
 I'm married a nerve ladies and gentlemen.
 So we always have internet wherever we go.
 So we have a little Verizon backpack for when we're in hard to reach areas.
 We can just tether to that and it does five devices.
 Or we could have just been with AD&amp;T.
 But it would cost us a fortune.
 Sadness.
 There's our iPhone update.
 Wasn't that exciting?
 I sat in a dentist chair for three hours while you were off getting an iPhone.
 Yes.
 I sat in a dent.
 as well. For three hours. I wave a wonderful dentist. And I'm currently having all my amalgam
 fillings removed. Yes, why? To get rid of all the mercury. Because it's. And my T-third
 not structured it. He was like, yeah, I won't tell you what he said, but basically my T-thre
 like Swiss cheese. So he's patching the map so I can get some orthodontic works so that
 my teeth don't look like a graveyard that's just been hit by a tornado. Yes. So good idea.
 But in the process of sitting in the chair for three hours, having my teeth drilled out,
 I didn't follow my dentist's duration and he ended up hitting my tongue with a drill.
 So as a result, my tongue got cut when it's not very pleasant.
 Oh, I'm sorry, babe.
 May you say that, but...
 I tried to put a bandit on for you and you're all like, "I didn't want to bandit in my mouth."
 Anyway.
 What else did we do?
 We went to the belonging conference this week.
 friends, Henry and Alex, see the run amazing church in Nashville called the
 belonging. It was the first conference this weekend and you went to more than I
 was able to with my dad in town. He's only here for seven days in the years.
 Some try to prioritize time with him. Yeah. How was your time of the conference?
 It was great. I wanted to make sure that I got to hear at least all the
 speakers that I hadn't heard or do my best. So I got to hear, I think his name
 was Jurgen on Thursday night. He was excellent. Really good.
 Was a name like that. He's definitely from Kentucky strangely enough. He isn't yeah
 but anyway, he passed was a church in San Diego and
 Brilliant, I think it was probably one of the better
 Salvation messages I've ever heard it was just excellent good and lots of people got saved. Oh, yeah, yeah
 and then
 Didn't make it there on Friday
 But made it back on Saturday and we heard Chris Durso. Mm-hmm. Who's from New York City?
 Well a fun little part about Chris Durso. I really enjoyed listening to him. He was a very funny guy and had some great points
 I tweeted out, but what I didn't realize was when I was younger so much younger than before
 Wait, that's a song. I just sorry. I got sidetracked into Beatles
 When I was younger I read an amazing book called Fresh Wind Freshfire by pastor Jim Simbala about the Brooklyn
 M. Bernackel Church from whence Comes the Brooklyn Temonoech Choir. It was a profound
 book. When I was still in the brethren, it was one of the first books that I read that
 helped me understand that there might be more than my current understanding. It was a really
 pivotal book for me to read. Well, I didn't realize that Chris is from that church and
 Misfit, which is the church born out of that church, is their young adult church. So that
 a nice little like, oh, it's really, it's so cool. Yeah, it was a nice little kind of join the dots of
 meeting him and getting to hang out with him and his crew that he brought from New York.
 And his wife was lovely as well. So they were super fun and very well dressed.
 Very well. And he smelled amazing. I sat next to him. I was like, good lord, he smells good.
 I'm impressed anytime people can pull off those flat-bell trucker hats, you know, and make it
 look like yes.
  </li><li>There's only a certain group of people
 who can pull off those flat bill nylon trucker hats
 and look cool and not scary.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And he definitely managed to do that.
  </li><li>He did it.
 Yeah, he did.
  </li><li>I would look scary in one.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
 I think really the next time that the Blowingy
 has a conference, we're gonna have to invest
 in some skinny jeans for both of us.
  </li><li>Nobody wants to see me skinny jeans.
 (laughing)
 We have to invest in a lot more black clothing.
  </li><li>And black clothing, yeah.
 Well, I was thinking black skinny jeans.
 And those long t-shirts that kind of like a bib at the back, you know, they're longer
 at the back than at the front.
 Yeah.
 Lyle was wearing a lot of those.
 I was just like, I'm so out of touch.
 It's true.
 And I just got a bunch of like UK baby boy clothing for MJ when dad came over and it
 all looks like Lyle clothing.
 Basically, MJ looks like a mini Lyle for Lyle.
 He does.
 Yeah.
 Except without the beard.
 Yeah.
 You know what?
 While he's asleep, that's sharpie on a beard.
 Let's go pencil it in.
 And then state church, an interesting announcement was made, wasn't it?
 Yes, we're going to start carrying gluten free muffins.
 They're just kidding.
 I just like to be fun.
 Oh, good side.
 That was awesome.
 Yeah, we had an exciting announcement.
 May Jeff and Becky, our senior pastors, announced drum roll, please.
 Go ahead.
 No, you have to crescendo it.
 Oh.
<strong>[LAUGHING]</strong>
 I'm sorry, that was the sort of horrendous in your car,
 Stairio.
 But basically announced that you and I
 are now the senior associate pastor at Grace Center.
 Yes.
 What does that mean?
 It kind of acknowledges some of what
 we've been doing already.
 Let's just cut to the chase.
 It doesn't mean we get our own parking space.
 No, it doesn't.
 I've been lobbying for a parking space since we got here
 at year now.
 It's very sad.
 It will not happen.
 No parking spots.
  </li><li>Just a helipad.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>Sorry I interrupted you by being funny.
 What were you saying?
  </li><li>Well, I mean, in some ways it acknowledges
 what we've already been doing,
 in many ways in the last couple of years
 in supporting Jeff and just trying to help make things happen
 and probably empowers us a bit more to serve better.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think that's a wonderful thing about authority.
 is it allows you to serve with greater emphasis, which I think is amazing.
 It's really funny because Jeff and Becky and you and I, the four of us have been talking
 for a couple of years now about what the Lord's been speaking to us about the direction
 of our church and where we're going.
 And so it's really exciting to see after a number of years of prayer us moving, beginning
 to move somewhat in the direction that we felt like the Lord's leading us in.
 And we feel super loved and super honored that Jeff and Becky and our church trust us
 in this role.
 And anyway, I'm super excited for what happens at Grace and are super excited about what
 happens in our city.
 I just loved two weekends ago being with Legacy Nashville and then this weekend being with
 the belonging.
 And then of course today being at Grace Center.
 I just love what God's doing in our city.
 Yeah, God's doing amazing stuff in our city.
 And I love that we're all connected to each other and we're all for each other and championing
 each other and that kind of stuff.
 That's super exciting to me as well.
 Yeah, I love what God's doing in our city.
 I think it's amazing.
 All right, our main topic.
 As I mentioned, two weeks ago, we were at the Legacy National Conference.
 And we were on a leadership panel and Pastor Lyle got to ask us questions along with Ask
 this moment, that questions about leadership. And then this weekend, I was leading a panel
 where I got to ask Pastor Henry and Pastor Alex a bunch of questions about leadership.
 But there were some questions we didn't get asked on the legacy national panel. And there
 were some questions I didn't get to run out of time before I could ask Alex and Henry these
 questions. So I thought we could discuss some answers to the questions I didn't get time to ask
 on this podcast. Everybody confused? Because I am. Are they hard questions?
 They're super hard questions.
 Are they about the Nephilim?
 They are.
 Excellent.
 That and women in ministry should be fine.
 Okay.
 How about this?
 I was going to ask them, but I'm going to ask you instead.
 Talk to me, and some of these aren't even questions,
 they're just thoughts with a question mark at the end.
 I was like, that's probably why I didn't ask them.
 That's going to be really helpful.
 Talk to me about the difference in skill sets between leading and serving.
 I mean, when you're leading, you're probably more in a visionary role
 and you're looking for, you're talking a little spirit about a direction and how to take whatever
 you're responsible for in that direction and that sort of thing. When you're serving, you're really
 finding out from your leader what the direction is and then trying to empower their vision.
 That's great. I thought of putting it in those terms as a brilliant answer.
 Oh, thanks.
 Well, why on a roll do you have any other thoughts?
 I think it would be wisdom for anybody who wants to be a leader to get really good at serving first.
 Because for one thing, you're sewing into having great people working with you later
 that are going to help you go after the vision that God gives you.
 And it's just good to have experience of not being the top guy and not getting to
 do everything you want to do and still staying and sticking in it and that kind of thing. One of the
 things that I really love about Alex and Henry's testimony is that in their previous incarnation,
 they stuck with it. Whether it was going their way or wasn't going their way, they were committed
 to, "All right, I'm going to stay where you've put me God." And I think that you learn stuff in
 those seasons that you can't learn by reading a book.
 Right. I think people look at Alex and Henry and look at what's happened at the belonging
 and think that happened overnight. For those of you who don't know the belonging, it's a great
 church in Nashville that's been around for about two and a half years and has grown to a couple of
 thousand people from just a bunch of people meeting in their basement. It's a great call
 and quote success story. And the trouble is people can look at what they've done and just think,
 "Oh, well, if I just do what they've done, I'll get what they've got." But that's not the case.
 There isn't an overnight success story. It's 20 years of serving really, really well.
 Faithfully serving.
 And then this is the fruit of them serving others.
 Right.
 It's that old line that I forget who said it, but it's a brilliant line that you only have as
 much authority as you choose to currently submit to.
 Yeah. That's awesome.
 Yeah. A lot of our, I view our upgrade to senior associate leaders at Gray Center is really
 more empowerment to serve Jeff and Becky's vision better.
 Yes. We can get a lot more done with authority than we can with influence.
 So Bill Johnson has this great phrase which I think ties the serving and the leading thing
 brilliantly. He says, "You want to lead with the heart of a servant and serve with the heart of a
 king." And in one way, leadership is still service, but you're serving a much larger group of people,
 typically. Yes. And I think good leaders will recognize that.
 When we come to speak, when we come to prepare a message, when we come to speak at the school,
 for example, I have in mind the will of God, obviously, Lord, what do you want to teach these
 people? But primarily, I'm thinking I am coming to serve these people with a message the Lord's
 put in my heart. I don't tend to think I've got amazing revelation. Please sit down, be quiet,
 listen to everything I have to say. It's really like, oh, here is something I think will impact
 your life. And if I don't have something that I think is a substance, I'd rather not speak.
 Right.
 And I think that's, I very much view that as serving that I want, I want what I prepare
 to be good because I don't want to waste other people's time.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I like that part of serving.
 So do I.
 Any other thoughts on serving versus leading? I think it's the same skill set
 but you aim at different places.
  </li><li>I think there's probably, yes, I do agree with that,
 but I think probably in the serving season,
 as opposed to the leading season,
 there's a different kind of dying.
  </li><li>Go on.
  </li><li>Well, I think in the serving season,
 you're really dying to yourself and your vision
 in order to serve someone else's vision.
 When you're actually the leader,
 you're probably more dying to what other people think
 about you and that's profound.
 You know, that sort of thing.
 So I think it's, I think God brings refining
 in different areas when you're in different seasons
 of leadership and of service.
 And that's part of why I think it's really unwise
 to short circuit it.
 Just, you know what I mean?
 I always get a little nervous when anybody's like,
 well, you know what, I'm just gonna go start my own church.
 And I'm like, gosh, I hope you learned
 whatever you needed to learn in the last season.
 because if you didn't, then you don't probably have
 what you need for the next.
 I've watched people be called to start a church
 and under the blessing of their current leadership,
 start a church and it go really well
 and I watched the opposite happen as well.
 So some of it I think is gonna still come down
 to letting leaders speak into your life.
  </li><li>I've got another question.
 Which I'm not sure what the question is
 but we'll see if one comes out.
  </li><li>Okay, to get another one.
 Talk about the ingredient timing, favor,
 anointing and gifting when it comes to leadership.
 Well, I think often you're gonna see gifting
 and anointing long before you're gonna maybe get the timing
 in the favor part of it, right?
 So I think when you think about sort of fledgling leaders,
 when you identify, oh, wow, I can totally see
 either the anointing on that person
 or the gifting on that person.
 But you know, it's not the right time to release that person.
 And they're not, you know, God's favor isn't on the moment for them right now for
 them to step into leadership or whatever.
 Like I think that's what those are the four things you're looking for them to
 align before actually release somebody into leadership for sure.
 But I'd probably throw character in there as the number one, you know, I think it's
 definitely important that they have, you know, gifting and anointing, but gifting
 you can train people to do most things. And the timing of God is, I suppose you can
 four stores open if you want to, but if you're going to wait for God, then you're going to
 get his timing. But character is your number one right there.
 One of the strangest dynamics I've seen is people who have a gift for leadership,
 that are gifting on them, am anointing to lead. But they want to lead where they're going.
 and they don't want to lead where they're at.
 So I remember reading a young man in Toronto
 who got something called me to lead a mega church.
 And I was like, that's awesome.
 What are you doing with it now?
 He was like, well, there's no mega churches hiring.
 So I was like, yeah, but if you started a small group,
 and he's like, you know, I'm not called to small people.
 And I'm like, how are you thinking
 that's going to work in your life?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Our friend David Campbell, who's a genius
 in his own right, and we did a podcast with.
 We'll put link in the show not to his episode because it's really worth while listening to me to one of the wisest people I know.
 He has this great phrase that if you're too big to serve, you're too small to lead.
 I've seen in our life, in the leaders that we've raised, that we've seen, they've had favor on them in our eyes,
 and it feels like the timing to release them, but they don't feel like they have the gifting, but we see the anointing.
 Yeah.
 So, in almost all of our small group leaders,
 for example, when we ask them to be small group leaders,
 they might have a desire to lead,
 but they might be like,
 I don't know if I'm gonna do a good job.
 And we're like, oh, we're not worried about that.
 Right.
 We're confident you're gonna do a good job.
 And we can train you to do that.
 Mm-hmm. Yeah.
 We recognize an anointing on your life to lead,
 and the gifting might not be there.
 And maybe for a while, the gifting isn't there.
 There's just the Holy Spirit going,
 you know, invest in them.
 Yeah.
 And you give them an opportunity
 you watch the gifting grow and that's like a tremendous joy to see.
 It's really fun.
 And then I think Josh and Sarah have talked about this publicly.
 But Josh and Sarah Parsons, who are worshiping creative arts pastors at Grey Center, I remember
 asking them initially when we were starting the school, would you come and be small group
 leaders and them having this reluctance in their heart?
 I don't know if we can do this.
 I'm not sure that's what our gifting is.
 And they would be an example of people that we felt like the timing was right and they
 clearly had favor for it.
 And favor doesn't make sense of course because they're like, "Well, you've never seen this
 lead.
 Why do you think it would be a good leader?"
 And I don't know if they would agree with us on our perspective.
 Maybe it took a little longer for them to see the gift of leaderships on their life than
 it perhaps it was for us.
 It was kind of obvious for us.
 I've loved watching them say yes to every opportunity to lead from the leaders and I love where they're at now.
 I love like this morning Elena was dancing on stage and I'm thinking Elena is dancing on stage because Josh and Sarah are her leader and they've created a creative arts program at Gray Center.
 And they're there because Jeff and Becky put them in leadership and they saw the leadership thing on them because we saw leadership thing in them and they started at the school.
 And you can trace it all the way back to them sitting in our breakfast room saying,
 "Would you come and lead a small group of six people?"
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I just love that.
 I love that whole process.
 That's very cool.
 So to everybody who's listening right now and you feel a sense of purpose, well, there's
 leadership or not, start where you are right now, start doing whatever is small because
 you're investing in where God's taking you and even though you can't see it.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Next question.
 questions. All right, go for it. No, go for it, please.
 So how do you balance ministry and kids?
 I was thinking about this because I once heard Dave Ramsey talking about,
 he wasn't talking about ministry, but he's like, how do you bring balance to your life?
 And he said, I have a different view of looking at balance. And it really helped me. He said,
 I think that we think balance means that every day has an equal portion of our responsibilities.
 He said, "But life doesn't fit itself well into a pattern like that."
 And he said, "If you think about when you're in university or whenever, there would be times
 when like finals, your balance would go out the window for a couple of weeks.
 You're like, "I've got my finals, so I'm going to say no to just going out with my friends
 and party and I'm going to say yes to being unbalanced for a season of doing a ton of
 prep work and getting stuff ready.
 And if you think about work, you might have a deadline at work and you might scale back
 on some things to say yes to finishing this deadline.
 And that really helped me with thinking about life because, for example, this weekend, we
 were away at a conference in the morning.
 But then, so we spent the morning at a conference, but we spent the afternoon, the evening solidly
 with our kids.
 We stack that.
 You're going away this weekend to go speak at a women's conference.
 So I'm going to counterbalance that by this weekend.
 I'm not going to do any ministry.
 I'm just going to be with my kids all weekend.
 So I think as long as you're addressing the imbalance, it doesn't have to be everything
 equal.
 You can have fits and starts in your schedule as long as your kids get the message that they
 They are more important than the ministry.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>What do you think?
  </li><li>I totally agree.
 I think if I don't view everything in seasons,
 I'll go crazy because there's part of me that wants,
 well, I think as parents,
 you want your kids to have the perfect childhood.
 And I don't know that that necessarily exists
 as long as your kids know that they're loved
 and they're prioritized.
 That's the residue that they're gonna take away
 from their childhood.
 So, I mean, we definitely have seasons where
 I don't feel like, oh, I didn't get enough time with them,
 you know, today.
 And then we have seasons where we get more time with them.
 And I think we just try and take advantage of each,
 you know what I mean?
 And then in the seasons where things feel really busy,
 really make sure that we're checking in with them
 and aware of how they're feeling.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think there's ebbs and flows of busyness.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I think as long as you have a great foundation
 of your kids feeling secure, then you can,
 if you have a norm, you know,
 like we have a fairly rigorous schedule.
 We know that since they've been born,
 they know that Monday night we go to emanate,
 they have a sitter that isn't weird to them,
 that isn't anxious.
 But if any of one of them was to throw a wobbly
 need us, I'd not go to emanate. I would just stay home.
 Well, we have done that. We've just been able to. Even on Friday, I was thinking about going
 to the conference, but MJ was talking about how he hadn't seen me. I was just like, "Okay,
 if you're feeling like you need mummy time, then you are the priority today, so that's
 fine."
 I think the hardest season was last year, starting year two. We knew it was going to
 be a big job. I don't think we underestimate how big it was going to be.
 I think that we hadn't realized the toll it was going to take on us. Yeah. So maybe that is underestimating it.
 And it was heartbreaking towards the end when our kids were like, is it almost over? Because we told them, hey,
 this is going to be a hard season. And I think it was the kindness of God that this summer was an amazing summer.
 summer. Even though we were moving house, that we got so much time to spend with our
 kids.
 Yeah, we did.
 And getting to go on vacation was such a big deal.
 Our kids had prayed all year, we want to go to Disney. Being able to go to Disney this
 year was such a reward for them.
 It really was, yeah.
 It just absolutely filled their love tank and having non-stop time.
 That's one of the things I'm thinking about in our new role of being this senior associates,
 How do we make sure our kids aren't sacrificed for a ministry?
 Because that's not our goal.
 And Jeff and Becky are so good at letting us time shift our hours.
 Oh, they're great at it.
 One of the things that Jeff's been so great at, like I do a lot of work in the evening
 so that in the afternoons I can be with our kids like we try and are home to get them
 off the bus.
 Yeah.
 And I try and spend between the hours of 4pm and 7pm with them.
 Where we can't?
 Like Monday that doesn't work.
 but the rest of the week we try and I'm there you're cooking I'm doing homework with them at the table
 Yeah, and because let's face it they're a school all day
 So they don't care what we're doing right and they go to bed at seven
 So I don't care what we're doing after seven right so we give them those three hours or make sure that they're focused on them
 and we all try and have one of us put them to bed yes, and
 And then you know they they're all fast asleep at seven
 They just boom, out like a light.
 And then we're usually working at night and that feels great, like our kids are getting
 to see us.
 But it honestly, it's one of the things I worry at the back of my head because I'm sure all
 passive things are doing a great job at balancing life.
 And we're the worst people to be able to determine that our kids are the most important
 people to be able to tell us that.
 Or in the case of, I mean, we're this kind of non-traditional, we're both in ministry together.
 But one of the saddest things is seeing a husband more typically driven in ministry,
 thinking he's doing a great job of balancing life and ministry, but his wife looks like a corpse.
 Right.
 And their kids just take the church and Lord, I don't ever want to see that happen.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 I mean, I think the key there is, you know, talking with your kids and letting your kids know that they're allowed to.
 And you want them to let you know if they're feeling like
 they've fallen off your grid or stuff like that. Our kids can say to us,
 "I just need a cuddle. I just want to sit and be cuddled," or "I just need to talk," or whatever.
 And that's what we want to make sure that you respond to.
 Well, here's a really practical thing. Our kids up until this year have never
 minded coming to both services at Grey Center. They've loved being able to see their friends
 both services. But about a month ago, they started saying, do we have to go to two services?
 It does not help anybody if my kids begin to resent going to the place that I love going to.
 Well, I think what I love is that Jeff doesn't want them to be sent to.
 Jeff is like, "Okay, we need to find a way to make that work." So your kids are not raised
 to loathe going to church on Sunday. So we're currently trying to work out a schedule of how
 How is it that our kids can come a one service
 and we can still do our jobs?
 And we're trying to work that out,
 but I love that there's discussions like that
 at the senior level, it's a grace and aware
 the priorities our kids are not sacrificed.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And yeah, I just think it's amazing.
 I have a question for you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I don't even know if this is a question, I'll read it out.
 You lead like you are not a stage version of yourselves.
 How did you arrive at that?
 That's wow.
  </li><li>That's how my brain works, this is the caddo.
  </li><li>Wow, look at that, that's terrifying.
 I think honestly, I watched John and Carol
 be the same people off the stage as on the stage.
  </li><li>So wonderful.
  </li><li>And they, I mean, you, they didn't put anything on
 when they got on the stage,
 they didn't have to take anything off
 when they got off the stage.
 You know what I mean?
 Like they just, the way they spoke,
 the way they treated people,
 the way they talked about the Lord,
 the way they prayed, everything was the same.
 And to me, that was authentic.
 And so that's, that was our, what do you call it?
 That's our grid.
  </li><li>It is our paradigm.
  </li><li>That's what we're used to.
 So it's easy to lead like who you are
 because that's how I was told to lead.
 You know, I was shown leadership
 by just people being authentic.
  </li><li>And what I love about that is you never caught off guard.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 You never have to forget to be a different version.
 Yeah.
 I love that we were being prayed for this one by the staff and the elders at Grace
 and we were being commissioned in this new role.
 I love what Tony Wakefield, who's our family life pastor said.
 He said that I'm paraphrasing here.
 We basically want you to be the best versions of yourself.
 Which is so lovely.
 And we've talked about that at length.
 Like in this role, it is not fair to us to be anything less than who we are.
 That's how people hit burnout.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And it's not fair to other people
 if we're not who we are.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And yet the truth is we have serious limitations.
 We do, there's stuff that's good about the way we lead
 and there's stuff that could be better
 about the way we lead.
  </li><li>Sure, absolutely.
  </li><li>And of course the solution is to help strengthen
 your weaker parts.
 But, and I'm not abdicating personal responsibility
 in saying that.
 Of course we wanna be working on our weaknesses.
 But there's a point when we try and massage
 weaknesses into being something we're really not. And the solution to that is the body of Christ.
 The solution is to have other leaders who have got the strengths where we're weak around us.
 Which is typically what we've done up until now is be able to identify where
 our strengths are and where our weaknesses are and then higher for our weaknesses.
 And not be intimidated that you have people around you that you can identify. This is
 definitely my weakness and they are awesome at this and let them be awesome at it.
 Right. Yeah.
 When I was a school teacher, before I ever started my first day, the city of Edinburgh paid for us
 to have a day of training, all these brand new teachers, and they picked some key teachers who'd
 been teaching for years to say, "Would you spend a day with new teachers and tell them what you need
 to know?" And without any sense of exaggeration, and not distaining the training I had received,
 But I would say that one day I spent actually one session of one day.
 Well, I received more practical training than I did in my whole year of teacher training.
 And basically, this teacher said, the only way you're going to be successful teacher
 is to have a relationship with your students.
 And the only way that you're going to have a relationship with your students
 is to be authentic.
 He said, because if you fake it and if you become a version of yourself,
 there's going to come a day in your life when your version cannot be sustained.
 your spouse is critically ill. One of your children has just died. You can have a serious cold.
 The day that you can't be yourself, if you haven't built any authenticity with your students,
 you've basically alienated them and they'll become hostile. When they see a chink in your
 arm or they'll pounce on you. So he said, "The alternate is teach from where you're at.
 Notch away from yourself." Of course, you have to have this finier as a teacher.
 be authentic who you are because honestly i promise you after a couple of months
 there's gonna be days when you can come in and you can say guys you know i have a headache today
 we're just gonna have a knuckle down and and do some book work today and i promise you next week
 we'll go back to schedule and they'll respect you because you've spent months being authentic
 and teaching them what will and won't work and and i love that and so even today when i'm teaching
 If I'm tired, I'm going to dial down my teaching and teach what I'm tired because it doesn't help anybody for me to be more tired by faking that I'm not tired.
 That's right.
 If I'm energetic, I'm going to go with it and I'm just so powerful. So that's how we lead.
 Yeah.
 What avenues have you created in your lives or what avenues have we created in our lives to ensure that we get fed and cared for?
 We're presumably being spiritually because Chick-fil-A lives to make sure I'm well fed.
 And the sort of part B to that was, do you seek it out or are there people coming to you?
 I think personal responsibility is that you're always responsible for feeding yourself unless you're an infant.
 Amen.
 So whether you're a leader or not, it is your job to be fed.
 Yeah.
 start demanding that other people do that for me. I'm going to be malnourished.
 You totally agree. And as for, I think it is my job to go get that, but I've also welcomed
 people into my life to spot when I'm spiritually malnourished.
 Yeah, identified bald spots. Right. Right. And it's never pleasant when people come and
 go, "It doesn't look like you're flourishing." Yeah.
 or hey, it kind of probably feels like you need to time out, like, you know, you are
 hangry.
 Yeah.
 So, yeah, I, you know, there's, there's, I, I want to round leaders, I'm asking them,
 you know, what's impacting you and I'm, I'm always interested.
 Whenever I'm around leaders, like we had the privilege of having lunch with banning
 leap share from Jesus culture two weekends ago was it when legacy national.
 And you know, I've tried to honor the fact that he's having lunch and that, but I just
 through a bunch of questions his way. The whole session that I was doing with Alex and Henry,
 basically, I just asked some questions I'd be meaning to ask them anyway.
 Constantly trying to glean from other leaders who are ahead of me, just to help me understand
 my Amazon list of books that I'm buying at the moment, to help me grow in areas of understanding
 is great. God bless us with such rich relationships where we get to ask brilliant people, brilliant
 question. Yeah, it's a really good. What about you? How am I getting fed? Yeah. I don't know
 that I'm doing a great job of getting fed new and challenging information at the moment. I think
 if I'm honest, I'm probably in a season where I'm sustaining and processing more than I'm
 eating new stuff. But I am thinking, oh, yeah, I want to read that. I want to, you know,
 so I think last year, because it was so intense, it probably took me the whole summer to decompress.
 Right. And we learned a lot last year.
 Yeah. And so there's still a lot, because of, because we did so much, even just research
 for new weeks of teaching and all that kind of stuff. There's still a lot of that that I'm thinking
 about and pondering constantly, but I think I'm heading towards wanting to chew on some new stuff.
 So, yeah, I'll probably be looking for some new stuff to read soon.
 -Babes, about that time in the podcast when we need a listener's question.
 And we have a fantastic question this week from Kevin.
 He writes this, "I've heard you speak about boundaries and relationships
 and got the idea that you personally and also teachers encourage people to say no to too many
 relationships. I have found myself an agreement with this for months the last seven plus years of
 my life. However recently I changed churches and had a fresh look at how attempting to gain new
 relationships can be so hard when other people are already set in their current relationships.
 My question is this, do you have any advice on this for the person seeking to be included or find
 find some people to share life with within their church community that may have many
 well-established connections that can seem hard to penetrate.
 I was like, "That is an amazing question.
 Do you want to know my first thought when I read that question?"
 I do want to know your first thought.
 Well, I was thinking about our life.
 We have some very well-established relationships in our life.
 The reason we encourage people to say no to too many relationships in their life is you
 can either go for depth or breadth.
 you're not going to get both i see people with hundreds of quote unquote relationships but they're not really relationships are like acquaintances that are an inch deep in substance.
 So it is impossible to maintain significant relationships.
 What without without care and without diligence so i you know we have existing relationships that we're working on.
 but they're not bolted down because i understand that all relationships are fluid
 their fluid with life their fluid with timing their fluid with all i just got a new job
 all i just have kids and so everybody's watched their friend get engaged for example and you suddenly
 realize oh my time allocation to my friend who just got engaged has adjusted slightly as they're
 spending more time with their fiance well that's supposed to happen yes and then when they get married
 you're getting even last time. That's a good thing. And then when Mary couples have kids,
 suddenly they might be finding that they're connecting more and more with people who also
 have kids in this life stage. So that's what I mean about fluid. I mean, my best friend in
 Edinburgh to this day, I mean, this was the person we spent vacation with on summer, but
 I used to spend every Tuesday night with Glenn, and I used to see him several times a week at
 church. Now I maybe see him once a month via FaceTime. And our relationship has had to change
 given the fact that there's time zones we live on the other side of the world. And it would be
 weird to exclusively maintain that relationship while ignoring all the great relationships that
 are available to either one of us in real life. So without understanding that relationships are
 always fluid, I'm always interested to see who the Holy Spirit is highlighting in any different
 season. For example, this weekend at the conference, we got the conference, we're at the belonging,
 we're having lunch, and there is somebody at that table that I'm having lunch with that I'm like,
 "Huh, if they were in the city, I would pursue a relationship with this person because the Holy
 Spirit is resting on them." No, they don't, so I'm not going to, and because that wouldn't make
 sense. But I think my encouragement to you, Kevin, is let the brilliance of who you are shine out.
 There's a verse in Proverbs that says, "A gift makes way for his giver, and ushers them into the
 presence of the great." I'm kind of taking that verse slightly out of context, but the great there
 in this, in the way of meaning is, you're looking at these people thinking, "Man, I'd be great to
 be friends with them," but they already look like they have great existing friendships. That doesn't
 manner, the greatness that God's put in you will shine out. So my encouragement to you is just be
 yourself, be brilliant, and respond to every invitation to go anywhere with anyone. Initially,
 when you're in a new place, it's, "Yes, I would love to have coffee." "Yes, I'd love to."
 You're not committing to anything, but basically you need to get known. You need to get connected
 if they're doing mixers, if you're doing socials, even if it's stuff you're not interested in.
 Small groups going there exposes your brilliance to other people and will usher you into the
 greatness of the people that God's you know, cause you to be in relationship with that happens to me
 weekly. I'm around people, new people, and for whatever reason, the Holy Spirit will light
 upon people and will be like, "Oh, that's interesting." So it got me thinking that that's my best thought
 first glance, AJ Jones, any thoughts on that?
 I would also say be persistent because sometimes I think we can
 think out of our own insecurities that somebody doesn't want to be
 friends with us because we, it hasn't happened yet. You know,
 like we haven't had coffee or we haven't, whatever. But like, just
 thinking about us, when I look around, there's, there's tons of
 people that I think, Oh, man, I wish I had the time to really get
 know that person because they seem amazing, but it's just not what this season looks like
 for us right now and that needs to be okay. And so I would say just pursue like go ahead
 and risk it and pursue relationship if you meet people that you're like gosh I think
 we would you know I think we get along or maybe don't open without law.
 Yeah maybe don't open with that. I have a joke with my friend Shannon because we came
 time to visit Grey Center at to do a conference there.
 And you know, about a year or so before we moved there and Shannon came up to me and she
 said, "Hi, I'm Shannon and if you lift close, we would be best friends."
 And I was like, "Wah, wah, wah, wah."
 You know.
 In terms of she wasn't a psycho, she was just being prophetic.
 Turns out it was pretty dead on, but you don't do that.
 I'm in spite of that terrifying comment.
 She made it through your armor.
 She was funny because when she tells the story, she said, you know, she's thinking in her
 head like, "What am I doing?" You know, so don't do that. But yeah, go ahead and just
 risk it with a couple of people. You know, if you find people that you're like, "You
 know what, I think we get along." And if for some reason this isn't the season of the timing
 for that, don't give up on people. Just keep pursuing interesting people.
 There's also seasons of hiddenness and manifestation in our lives where we're genuinely invisible
 some people for some reasons and were highly visible to other people. And so learn to navigate
 the favor that you have in different people's eyes. And I'm sure we're repeating stuff you've
 already heard of sake, but such a great question. I'm glad you asked it. And it caused me to think
 on it. And if you want to write in and tell us your experiences later, I'd love to hear
 any more wisdom on that situation.
 Well, to wrap up, 'tis the season for conferences in Nashville. We have Heaven Declares
 conference coming up in October. It's the 27th through the 29th. We have about 70 tickets left
 at our early-bird pricing, which is $59. Then it'll start going out from there. It's $100 at the
 door if you-- I would hate anybody to pay $100 at the door. There's no reason to pay $100.
 Especially when you get a ticket for less than $60. If you haven't got your ticket for our annual
 up for Vatican for the grace and we would love you to come life.
 Hetland is speaking Jamie Galloway speaking and Andy Squires is leading worship is going
 to be super amazing.
 It is it is and I'm also reminded that it's only 12 more Sundays until Christmas is it
 to use me.
 No, you will kind of I think it's got to be close to 12.
 Let's ask Siri.
 Let's ask Siri.
 Hey, Siri, how many more Sundays is it till Christmas?
 three months until then.
  </li><li>Ha ha.
 12 Sundays.
 So I don't know what my point was in that, but you said 'tis the season.
 And so I-
  </li><li>And you started thinking about Christmas.
  </li><li>I did.
  </li><li>I have a question for you.
 How excited are you about Christmas?
  </li><li>I'm excited about Christmas.
  </li><li>Is it too early to play in Christmas?
  </li><li>It isn't.
 It isn't too early.
 It's never too early.
  </li><li>Have you been thinking that maybe this year is the year we decorate the outside of
 our house?
  </li><li>Let's do it.
  </li><li>We need to see what kind of craziness.
 We need to pitch the level of craziness relative to our neighborhood.
 I want to see what our neighbors do at Christmas.
 I'm thinking that our neighbors are going to be fairly impressive at Christmas, but we
 could maybe launch some sort of competition, a light competition, like that movie with
 the snowman.
 Yeah, it didn't end well for anybody.
 Oh, you're right.
 Never mind.
 Well, now you've totally sidetracked my thought life.
 All I'm thinking about is exterior lighting.
 I want to decorate the outside of her house.
 Okay, get me some fireworks.
 I'm going to need plenty of fireworks.
 Wait, wrong season.
 All right.
