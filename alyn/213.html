<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Welcome to episode 213 of Keeping Up With The Joneses,
 where this week I'm especially glad to have
 this little snuggle buckle all the way back
 from Toronto, Canada.
  </li><li>I'm back, baby.
 Life can return to normal.
  </li><li>Ah, it can.
 I realize that normally we do like a weekly catch-up,
 and then we go into our main topic,
 But there's so much blur between the main topic
 and the weekly catch up that why don't I do
 our weekly catch up from the first half
 before you went to Toronto?
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And then the main topic can all be about
 your time in Toronto.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>First off though, we need to apologize.
 This episode is probably gonna be coming out
 on a Wednesday, they normally come out on a Monday.
 You'll probably understand why it didn't come out
 on the Monday as I start talking.
 So last week, if I remember correctly,
 we had our dear friend, Dan Farrelly,
 from Bethel Church in Reading, California,
 come out and be with our students in first year,
 teaching on brave communication.
 Meanwhile, I was teaching in second year
 on the coming judgment.
  </li><li>It's a nice fluffy subject, the coming judgment.
  </li><li>Well, no, there's nothing.
  </li><li>There's nothing fluffy about it.
  </li><li>There's nothing fluffy about it.
  </li><li>Monday I taught on the doctrine of predestination
 and repurvation, which is just horrible.
 We started talking about Calvinism and Armenianism.
 And if you don't know what either of those are,
 just be thankful.
  </li><li>You're fine.
  </li><li>Two ends of one spectrum that anyway,
 then we started talking about the, oh,
 Soteriology, the doctrine of salvation.
 I put myself to sleep here.
 Then we talked about how, that it's a very real place.
 You've heard us talk about this stuff before.
 We'll put links in the show notes.
 Then the very last class we taught on
 the coming judgment, the judgment of Christ.
 So all of being said, it was intense, but it was a lot of fun,
 but it was a lot of teaching for sure.
 And then at the same time,
 I had a friend in from Scotland,
 a pastor from Scotland who came over to hang out with us.
 And so he was staying with us.
 And-
  </li><li>Only us was only him and children.
  </li><li>Because on Tuesday.
  </li><li>Because I left.
  </li><li>You flew up to Toronto, which we'll get to in a second.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Tuesday, Wednesday, it's all a blur.
 It was our six-year-old son's 100th birthday.
 I was gonna say that.
  </li><li>No, 100th day of school.
 Right.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>100th day of preschool,
 so I had to dress them up as a 100 year old man.
  </li><li>Except it's not preschool, it's kindergarten.
  </li><li>See?
 This is what happens when I wipe me.
  </li><li>He needs me, he needs me.
 You just remember that.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>So basically, I was running the show,
 which historically has been a very easy thing to do,
 but for whatever reason, I don't know whether it's
 because we were hosting guests
 and it's particularly busy week at work.
 And, you know, I'm dealing with the kids,
 but don't ask me what the kids ate.
  </li><li>So here's the thing.
 You know how you confess to killing my balloon on camera?
  </li><li>I didn't confess to killing your balloon on camera.
  </li><li>Well, on the podcast.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So I have a confession for you.
 Normally when I go away,
 I like make muffins and make sure that the groceries
 and the food is all sorted out for you.
 But when I said, I'm going away and I need to get things
 ready and you're like, oh, no, no, I'm fine.
 I don't even notice when you're gone.
 I thought, all right, then I'll just let you do it.
 And I left.
  </li><li>And it was fine.
 If I find you need the children, one day for lunch,
 I made the kids banana sandwich with Cadbury's buttons
 in them.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Ooh, health food.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And then twice, twice I let Abigail
 buy her lunch because it was easier than making her lunch and yeah I need you I'm sorry I
 repent yeah we didn't have any laundry either because you hadn't done any laundry so it was
 an interesting week anyway oh I'll show you where those machines are as soon as we're done here
 you swarmed around in in Canada land while I just slave and looked after the kids I did I just
 swarmed around and then as soon as you landed on Friday we went straight into a weekend conference
 with Danny and Sherry Silk also from Bethel Church in Reading California.
 All that to say, by the time we normally record our podcast on Sunday night, by the time we got
 to Sunday night, it was literally 9.30, by the time we were 9.30 pm that we were free,
 and we sat down on the sofa and we're like, "No." We don't have the energy to record and edit and
 upload. So that's why this episode is late, but I still know it's going to be a good one,
 because we're going to be talking all about Toronto.
  </li><li>You? - Toronto.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I'm gonna look and see what was there anything else
 that we were supposed to be talking about?
 Oh, I forgot that also in addition to Friday
 being the 100 day celebration of kindergarten,
 my third grader had to bring in 25 things
 that she created at home.
  </li><li>To sell.
  </li><li>I discovered that we had a hot glue gun,
 a hot glue gun, which is an awful lot of fun to use,
 but hurt like you would not believe when it gets on you.
  </li><li>So like, it's nine, eight minutes.
  </li><li>It's not glue gun.
  </li><li>And I'm gluing, she wanted to make pet rocks.
 So I'm gluing these little pom-poms on top
 and just questioning my life choices.
 I'm wondering why my wife just left.
  </li><li>Well, you said you had this, you know,
 so I did mention that the rocks had to be done
 and you were like,
  </li><li>I got this, babe, I got this.
  </li><li>I don't think I was that dismissive, was I?
  </li><li>You really were.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So I just left you a flounder.
 I even told Stuart what I had done, my friends.
 I was like, well, he said he's got this.
 So I didn't even just do the extra things to like set him up.
 He said he was, you know, an adult.
  </li><li>I'd like to help the flu repain.
 I am no longer an adult.
 I need your help.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Our main topic is all about the reason you went to Toronto.
 Tell everybody why you're in Toronto
 and what was going on.
  </li><li>They had the 25th anniversary
 of the revival starting in Toronto,
 which, you know, was, I was part of that church
 before the revival started.
 So our whole senior team, minus Allen, and then, oh, baby.
 And then actually Becky ended up not being able to go either
 because of some family stuff.
 But the four of us went up for the 25th anniversary conference.
 So it was awesome.
 The worship was great and the speakers were all people
 that were connected with the revival.
 So like Randy Clark.
  </li><li>Well, hold on, 'cause I was thinking about this.
 I was thinking, they were very, very clever in who they invited.
 Yeah.
 So for those of you who don't know your really modern church day history, 1994, January 20th,
 Randy Clark visits the small little church in Toronto, Canada at the end of a runway
 of the airport, and John and Carol Arnott are the pastors of the church, and the Holy
 Spirit historically visits this church in incredible power.
 So they had the current
 So they had the current speakers correct me if I'm wrong with John and Carol, the founding
 pastors.
 You had Stephen Sandra, who are the senior pastors.
 You had Randy Clark, all those guys were right there at the beginning.
 Yeah, well, Stephen, Stephen Sander didn't speak.
 Oh, they were just hosting.
 They were hosting.
 Okay.
 So you had speakers from the, from the main of, you know, from the historical event, Randy
 and John and Carol.
 Yes.
 invited Heidi Baker and Bill Johnson, who arguably would be two of the most well-known
 present-day ministries who were greatly impacted by that revival.
 Yeah, it just, yeah, it sort of turned everything on its head for them.
 And then they had the next generation leaders.
 Benning and Sean.
 And then you had Brian and Jen Johnson leading worship.
 Yeah.
 And then Duncan and Kate, who oversee Catch the Fire.
 Yeah.
 I mean, it was a standup conference.
 It was great.
 It was also super fun.
 Well, it was great.
 I mean, Randy kicked it off and it was typical.
 Randy is very approachable and, you know, he's, he just, when you teach, when he teaches,
 you're just like, wow, this is for me.
 Oh, he's a phenomenal.
 He's so good.
 So good.
 And then they prayed for everybody and they had it all organized.
 Like if you came here from the U S, you go to this room.
 If you came from Europe, you go to this room.
 if you can't, you know, and they had all the teams
 and the different, it was so well organized.
 It was just really good.
 So you have like however many thousands of people
 'cause it sold out just being able to get prayer
 every single one of them.
 So it was great.
  </li><li>What was it like going back to your church
 as a visitor when you used to be a,
 like a member of the fabric?
 Was that bizarre?
 Because you posted one photo to your Instagram feed,
 are you lining up to get in the building?
  </li><li>It's the first time I've ever lined up ever.
 So even at the beginning of the revival,
 I didn't line up, I had keys.
 And so it's kind of funny that on the 25th anniversary
 is the first time I ever lined up.
  </li><li>Beautiful.
  </li><li>To get in.
 So there you go, I lined up.
 It was, I mean, on one level, it was cool to kind of see it,
 how everybody else saw it, I guess,
 and sort of go through, they had planned it so well
 and it really ran like a machine, you know, just everything.
  </li><li>A bunch of geniuses up there
 who've been running conferences for 25 years
 and are brilliant at it.
  </li><li>Yeah, so in many levels it was super fun and educational
 and then I saw tons of people in the lineup
 that maybe I wouldn't have seen
 once we got in the massive room.
 So I got to hug lots of people.
  </li><li>I was gonna say, did you forget just how many people
 you know from 25 years of being in Toronto?
  </li><li>I was, well, there were some people
 that definitely knew me and I didn't know them at all,
 but I had some random huggings.
  </li><li>Right. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Well, you just are like,
 "Hey, it's so nice to see you, man."
  </li><li>You know, thanks for that great big hug.
 Do I know you?
 But for the most part, I mean, it was just really fun
 to be with people that I've known for 25 or more years
 and being a place where we're all just sort of giving God glory for what he's done and what he's
 doing. And it really was like a global meetup, wasn't it? I mean, you ended up, you'd send me
 pictures like, "Look, I just found people from all over the world." All over the world.
 Friends family connection. We had some friends that came up from New Zealand and
 I saw people from Australia that I know in England bumped into like Paul Oakley and people like that.
 That's just like tons of people from all over the world
 that came home to the place where they got impacted,
 if that makes sense.
 So it's very cool.
 And then Wednesday, John spoke,
 and I mean, I think I could probably listen to John all day.
 He's just so calm while talking about amazing things
 and just super encouraging.
 And then they did like panels and stuff.
  </li><li>Like a Q and A panel?
 Q&amp;A panel that were all sort of mediated by Ben, which was great.
 And then Sarah spoke, which was amazing.
 Sarah Jackson and actually Ben Jackson, they've been on our podcast before, put Link in the
 show notes to their episodes.
 Yeah.
 So, honestly, Sarah was off the charts.
 She's so good.
 And then Duncan and Kate spoke.
 It was just sort of, it was really fun to just see all of these different people doing what
 they're built to do and just think, wow, 25 years has impacted so many people and just
 their testimonies and didn't hide in Carol tag team and obliterate the place.
 Awesome.
 So I think that was on Thursday.
 Heidi had spoken the morning and it was sort of half staying half speak, but it was great.
 And then in the afternoon, Carol and Heidi were talking about the Holy Spirit and basically,
 what does the Holy Spirit do?
 Why do you want them to be your friend kind of thing?
 And then what hinders him?
 But it was funny because Heidi would share different stories from her life.
 And Carol's one of these people where if you share a touching story, she wants to touch
 you.
 She just wants to go, "Oh, oh."
  </li><li>And connect with you.
  </li><li>And connect with you.
 And so Heidi's sharing some deep things
 that she's walked through or experienced
 and been healed of and that kind of stuff.
 And every time she'd share something
 that was super deep or super sweet,
 Carol would be like, oh,
 and then Heidi would hit the floor.
 And so then we'd have to like,
 a couple times Carol was like,
 all right, stand her up.
 We wanna hear the rest or whatever.
 And sometimes she just left her
 and Carol would teach for a bit.
 And then Heidi'd finally get back up the floor
 and Heidi would teach a little bit,
 and then she'd share some sort of story,
 and then Carol would reach for her and down she'd go,
 and it was pretty fun.
 It was lovely.
  </li><li>What would you say your top three moments
 of your trip was?
  </li><li>They're probably all relational things,
 just getting to connect with people I've known for ever,
 and just sit next to them, or be in the same room,
 and just experience God together kind of thing.
  </li><li>You have two more.
  </li><li>Just getting some time with Carol,
 sneaking away and doing that.
 And then number three,
 we'll probably be being with our Grace Center team there
 and just getting to experience all of that there with them.
 Kind of like, hey, let me introduce you to what was my home.
 You know what I'm surprised that you didn't give in an answer?
 What?
 Was decent ethnic food?
 Well, yeah, I didn't want to seem too shallow by putting food on my top three, but let's
 say it comes in at three and a half.
 Yeah.
 Yes.
 We actually took Tony and Jeff and Danielle to Fomi 99, which is like a...
 Fafmi 99.
 Wow.
 That's about Faux.
 uh, for me 99, uh, which is a Vietnamese place and it's great. I mean, you go in there and
 you kind of order by number and you're not really sure what you're going to get and this is still
 six dollars a bowl. I'd have to like eight dollars or something. It used to be our after church venue.
 Every every week, every week, Sunday, soon as church was over, it would go there because it was
 cheap and it was filling and very tasty and.
 Yes, and so I think Tony liked it, but Jeff loved it.
 So for every meal until they went home, he was trying to figure out if we could make
 it back there, which we had gone down in the middle of the day on a Tuesday, but normally
 traffic so bad in Toronto that during the lunch breaks or dinner breaks, it wasn't
 really a feasibility.
 So we never made it back.
 So I think I'll be able to get him back to Toronto for Vietnamese food at least.
 It is amazing to me that 25 years later, the power of the Holy Spirit is still being poured
 out in that place.
 Yeah.
 And lives are still being touched and lives are still being transformed.
 And I just love that about John and Carol.
 I love their faithfulness to just give away everything that they've been given.
 And they've just stewarded it brilliantly.
 I think church history is going to smile really, really well on this season of church history
 and John and Carol's contribution.
 I was wondering, would you pray for all of our listeners to experience the touch of the
 Holy Spirit as someone who has spent much of her life in Toronto whose existence predates
 revival in that church, and somebody who's been saturated in that, and somebody who's
 just been there?
 Would you?
 Hey, you could do the thing where you stretch out and touch the TV screen.
 You want them to touch the TV?
 I love that.
 You know what?
 I'm a sucker for all that.
 Let's do this.
 I know some of you are going to be watching via video and so you're going to have a visual
 and others are going to be listening.
 But why don't you put out your hands like you are ready to receive a gift?
 Just imagine somebody's going to put a big box.
 Let's all hope they're in Teslas right now.
 That Tesla is all a pilot.
 Okay.
 So if you're driving, please don't do this until later.
 You can just open your heart to receiving a gift.
 But it's just sort of, position yourself in a posture of receiving is basically what
 I'm saying.
 I'm in the receive mode.
 Holy Spirit, I ask for every single person that is listening to this podcast, that is
 watching the video cast, Lord, that you would fill them from the top of their heads to the
 tip of their toes, Lord, that you would wash away everything of anxiety, everything of
 of fear, everything of sickness.
 And Lord, that you would fill them so much with your presence
 that they would overflow in their families,
 they would overflow in their workplaces,
 wherever they go, that you Holy Spirit
 would sort of splash out of them
 and affect the environment and the places where they go.
 Lord, I ask that you would come and touch them
 in such a powerful way that they would know
 that you've answered their prayer.
 So I thank you, Lord, for what you're about to do
 and what you're continuing to do in each one of us
 because you're good.
  </li><li>Oh, I love that.
 Yeah, I totally feel the Holy Spirit with your pray.
 It's about time for a listener's question.
  </li><li>Oh! - Are you ready for them?
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm ready.
 Wait, slurp of coffee.
  </li><li>Okay, yeah, it's freezing in here.
 I did try to run a heater.
  </li><li>My coffee's not even hot anymore.
  </li><li>Well, I did try to run a heater in our studio,
 which is in our basement right now and...
  </li><li>If you could see it.
 It looks like a better in 10.
 And then we just put up a wall behind it to make it look good.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>It's sorry.
  </li><li>There's lots of lights.
  </li><li>There's lots of all sorts of things.
  </li><li>Lots of electricity, lots of lights.
 So I think we're maxing out the panel that,
 everything's run off like one, one 10 outlet
 and about 16 different boxes.
 Like we need to get Neil out here.
 He'll probably have a fit when he sees it.
 But when I put like an a heater,
 it cuts the power to everything.
 I'm like, okay, we just need to be cold till we can figure out why that's happening.
 Which is why you can also hear, which is AJ's ski jacket.
 I can't.
 It's so cold down here.
 All right.
 This is a great question.
 This is from an anonymous listener who's written in.
 High anonymous listener.
 And they have said, I've heard you say that the more healing a single person gets,
 the more healed up the people they attract will be.
 So our whole theory is that you attract the level of emotional and
 relational health that you currently possess.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I've also heard you say to go hard after God,
 then just look around and see who's keeping up.
 Okay, if you're looking for a boyfriend or girlfriend,
 move her somebody a day, just pursue the Lord.
  </li><li>The whole visual, like you're running in the news.
 Oh, look, there's people with me, okay, yeah.
  </li><li>I'm wondering though, if you have any advice
 for discerning whether it's wise to pursue a relationship
 without judging the other person's walk with God,
 I imagine your first answer would be to look
 fruit, but are there specific earmarks of maturity you would be looking for in particular?
 I think you're asking two questions there.
 The first question is, if we have any advice for you to discern whether it's wise to pursue
 a relationship without judging the other person's walk with God, no, that's not wise.
 Right?
 So scripture says, don't be unequally yoked.
 So in order to be equally yoked, you have to be able to assess the level of maturity
 of the person that you're pursuing.
 And again, you're not judging the person, you're just sort of judging the fruit really,
 more than anything else, right?
 Yeah, you're just wanting to assess, is this person going to be compatible with me?
 Are they running in the same direction?
 And remember that a judgment is an observation with attitude.
 So you're not sort of going, "I can't believe they blah, blah, blah," but you're just being
 observant to say, "Hey, is this person actually who they say they are?"
 Right.
 mind, you ask what are there specific earmarks of maturity that we should be looking for in
 particular? What kind of earmarks would you be looking for? So when you're considering whether
 it's the date me or not, what were some of the hallmarks of somebody you wanted in some of you
 were going to be in relationship with?
  </li><li>Well me, I guess knowing that I just needed you
 to be good looking baby and have a pulse,
 not just kidding.
  </li><li>You're welcome.
  </li><li>I was very aware that I didn't want to shrink back
 and pretend that I'm not who I am, say I am,
 or not be who I am.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So I knew I was looking for somebody
 that would be able to lead me and not give in
 to like fear of man or any of that kind of stuff.
 So I think some of it is,
 you need to kind of know yourself enough to know
 for a female who could lead you.
 'Cause I think it's really important
 that you got to lead, does that make sense?
  </li><li>Yeah, but even then, you know,
 we should do a podcast on this
 'cause I don't think I lead per se,
 I think we lead our marriage.
  </li><li>We do, I do agree that with that,
 But I, as a female, just needed to be able to trust
 that you could lead.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Does that make sense?
  </li><li>I'm fine to lead as long as you don't go to Toronto
 and lead me with like groceries or, you know,
 bed linen or clothes or 100 year old makeup
 or pom-poms on a hot glue gun, right?
 I think we've established that fact.
 What are some of the other characteristics
 you'd be looking for?
 I'd be, I mean, just a no-brainer,
 simple devotion to Christ.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Is the person you're looking at fully devoted to Jesus?
 Does their relationship with God cause you jealousy?
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>You just did?
 Like when I met you, I was like, "Dannning!"
 Thought I was devoted and then I saw you
 and I was just like, "Okay, no,
 "in terms of a spirit of competition,
 "but are you inspired by their connection with God?"
  </li><li>Yeah, would being with them want you to get closer to God
 or sort of lull you into apathy?
  </li><li>One of the pieces of advice that we got,
 which I didn't like at the time,
 but now I see his wisdom,
 Fred Wright, who's one of AJ's spiritual fathers,
 I asked, "Hey, could I, I'd really like to date AJ?"
 And he said, "I think that's a great idea.
 Just do me a favor, don't get married
 until you've seen four seasons together."
 And at the time I was like, four seasons,
 that's like a year, which isn't really, okay?
 'Cause you know, you've got spring, summer, fall, winter.
 I mean, anyway.
 The point was, it's really, really important
 to see people in different seasons,
 not just natural seasons, like what are they like in the winter and what are they like in the summer,
 but seasons of stress, seasons of challenge, seasons of hope, seasons of disappointment,
 what are they like with power, what are they like with people, what are they like around their family,
 what are they like under pressure, those sorts of things are things you want to pay attention to.
 Yeah. But I also think seasons are important because the whole season of seasonal effect of
 disorder thing, like people do change in different seasons. You get super grumpy when it's wet.
 I get grumpy when I do it.
 You don't like rain.
 They're nobody likes rain.
 Okay. See, that's called justification of sin.
 My hair gets fuzzy.
 That's why I get grumpy.
 That's a silly company.
 I don't want fuzzy hair.
 So, I hope that helps.
 Those are the other things you're going to think of
 that you look for.
 I think you look for somebody who's willing
 and is demonstrating that they're dealing with their own stuff.
 Yes.
 So, I mean, I think the reason that so many people
 get married and you have this whole, you know, thing going around about, "Oh, the first year
 of marriage is the hardest," is because all your stuff comes to the surface and if you
 haven't dealt with it, of course it's hard. But if you find someone who's already working on their
 stuff and working on their forgiveness issues and pressing into God and that kind of stuff,
 then I think that that makes that whole thing a lot easier.
 Mm-hmm. Agreed. Agreed. Yet. Do they go after stuff? What's it like when you give them feedback?
 Can they apologize? Oh, important things that you will find out one way or another,
 are better to do your research before you have matching rings. On the topic of matching rings,
 we had a very important kind of query that we sent out to the internet last week.
 Okay, so the query was, I was asking if people once they're asleep, so married couples, when you're
 in bed. It's not. I'm not talking about during special cuddle time or any of that. I'm just
 talking about when you're going to sleep. Do you want to be touched as you're falling
 asleep? Do you want to be touched or or are you don't touch me people and unanimously
 people said don't touch me, which just goes to prove that you're all freaks because the
 The correct answer is, you fall asleep, snuggled up with somebody and it's amazing.
 It was so funny.
 I had so many different people come up and go, "Hey, I didn't see the poll on Instagram."
 I think that's because we forgot to put it up.
 No, it's because I deliberately didn't put it because by that time, that time I had so
 many people say, "I'm Team AJ.
 I'm Team AJ.
 I'm Team AJ."
 And I'm just thinking, "There are so many weirdos out there."
 No.
 And on Sunday, it was really funny.
 The Zofals came up to me.
 And the Zofals be in their 70s or late 70s.
  </li><li>You can't say that the Zofals
 are a gorgeous couple in our church.
 Who have got much more wisdom
 and much more years of marriage than we had.
  </li><li>And they don't want to be touched either.
  </li><li>And they come on there like, no.
 And lots of people said we have an invisible line
 with a bed and you do not cross it.
  </li><li>Well, I actually have come up with an invention
 that I'd like to make based upon this,
 such I think many people would purchase.
  </li><li>Go on.
  </li><li>Basically, I want to somehow put a taser strip
 down the center of the bed.
  </li><li>Spice things up.
  </li><li>So that once activated,
 and it would just be activated when it's sleeping time,
 it would like light up and just give a small bud.
 Well, motivating shock to those people crossing the line
 so that you get your own space to sleep in.
 I would like to revise my answer.
 You know what you're saying?
 What do you look for in a person
 that you're interested in pursuing?
 Make sure you're compatible in the cuddling
 as you fall asleep thing.
 That's an important thing.
  </li><li>Good luck to you that wanna be touched
 because most people don't.
 So you're looking from a very small pool.
 So as we're wrapping up,
 I wanna say hi to our friends in West Gaggenich.
 I got to see you in Toronto.
 It's so nice to see you.
 I'm so glad you're listening.
  </li><li>Explain what a West Gaggenich is.
  </li><li>A wascagan-ich is a Cree reservation up on the James Bay.
 And it was a place I got to go and minister a few times.
 They're an amazing, amazing group of believers.
 And that was really fun to see you
 at the Revival Conference.
  </li><li>And a Cree is?
  </li><li>Cree are North American Indians.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I'm just, when I age you said, hey, we're gonna go
 with scaggin' it, I'm like, we're gonna go wear it out.
 And you're absolutely right, it is absolutely beautiful.
 It was one of my most memorable trips ever.
 So I'm so glad that we can still be with you,
 at least electronically in your ears or on your TV screen.
  </li><li>And thank you for feeding us moose.
 I loved the moose.
 Not so much the moose lips, but the moose, very good.
 (laughs)
 We also wanna thank one of our patrons named Shannon.
 Thank you so much for helping us do this show.
  </li><li>Yeah, our patrons are wonderful listeners
 just like you who support the show financially
 from as little as a dollar an episode.
 You can become a patron yourself by visiting
 allen and aga.com/support.
 In addition to funding the show,
 you can actually watch the video version of this podcast.
 You can watch a shivering.
 Apparently, Edgy said everything I'm wearing today
 is wrong and none of it matches.
  </li><li>You need to watch the video.
 It's not right.
  </li><li>Don't tell them.
  </li><li>It's not right.
 Okay.
  </li><li>It's just a nun's outfit.
 It's nothing weird about that.
 So nun's outfit with a cowboy hat.
 I don't know what's wrong with that.
 So until next week, thanks for tuning in.
 We pray you have a glorious week.
