<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>AJ Jones, how the heck are you?
  </li><li>I'm okay, how are you?
  </li><li>Episode 242.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Weekly catch up.
 Last week we were in--
  </li><li>North Carolina.
  </li><li>Had a beautiful time.
  </li><li>We did?
  </li><li>Yep, visiting family, which was great.
  </li><li>My sister and her husband and their two kids
 live in North Carolina.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 advantage of the fact that we're still working from home.
 Mostly mostly. Yeah.
 And just asked our boss.
 Yeah.
 The Reverend Jeff Dollar.
 Can we work from home in Charlotte?
 And he was like, sure.
 So we drove over.
 Ma, he assisted her.
 God bless her.
 Has put a pool in her backyard.
 So largely my office was.
 Now, I'm not sure that Cara's actually put the pool in herself.
 I'm pretty sure they purchased that, you know, you made it sound like she was out
 there with a shovel making a pool in her bag.
 I'm very sure from context.
 See, I always didn't assume that.
 Yeah, so they, yes.
 The dentist is in 101.
 Yeah, yeah, sorry.
 I would, for various reasons, time change, I don't know.
 I would be awake early.
 I was awake at 6 a.m. every morning.
 And so I would get up, I'd go downstairs,
 fix myself some breakfast.
 Then I would work outside on their back patio,
 which was in the shade from about,
 or seven a.m.
 Well, most of the day at 7 a.m.
 Yeah, but it got too hot for me,
 but midday I would come in.
 Yeah, that's when I wanted to go out.
 'Cause it was just getting warm enough for me.
 Yeah.
 So thank you to my sister and her husband
 for great accommodation looking at dressed.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And it was so great.
 The kids getting to just swim and have fun while we're working
 as opposed to they're in the house trying to take care
 of like coming up with ideas.
  </li><li>I think our kids have adopted your fish like nature
 and they just want to be in the pool all the time.
  </li><li>Well, yes, they would come by it, honestly.
  </li><li>My sister also has three fairly big dogs.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I mean, one a chocolate lab.
  </li><li>They're not fairly big, they're big.
  </li><li>Well, the lab's not that big.
 The lab's a normal size,
 but then they have a German shepherd
 that's the size of a chantlin.
 a long, a long haired German Shepherd.
 And then they have another dog that's across between a St.
 Bernard and a, uh, Rottweiler?
 Uh, no, what's a dog like a Rottweiler?
 Pitbull. No, it's a Rottweiler.
 Is it? And it just, it's all through the bermies.
 Something, isn't it?
 It's a bermies.
 Anyway, we should have paid more attention.
 They shed a lot and they're very, very, very, but they're gorgeous.
  </li><li>And we were trying to prime our kids like,
 hey, listen, dogs will feed off the energy you give out.
 By the end of the week, my kids were just--
  </li><li>Oh, they didn't want to leave the dogs, yeah.
  </li><li>So, North Carolina was beautiful.
 Great food ate some great--
  </li><li>Italian food. - A tiny food.
  </li><li>Is that how you pronounce it?
  </li><li>Yeah. - Gonotchi.
  </li><li>They live like less than a mile
 from a really good Italian restaurant.
 So we had great food.
  </li><li>I had a mango cheesecake that was maybe one
 of the best cheesecakes I've ever had in my life.
  </li><li>I had a weird lemon dessert,
 which I still don't know what was in it,
 but it was so great.
  </li><li>We have a birthday party coming up in a couple of days,
 our 11 year old turned 12.
  </li><li>She does.
  </li><li>You know what that means?
  </li><li>We have a 12 year old?
  </li><li>Well, yes.
  </li><li>Good?
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>That also means she gets an iPhone.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Curious though, she didn't care, she didn't want one.
  </li><li>Well, I'm sort of in great debate
 about whether she didn't want one or not,
 She's wanted one for the last two years.
 I think she's never brought it up to me.
 We were just adamant.
 You either get an apple, Walter, you get an iPhone.
 Yeah, we need some way to be able to get ahold of you while you're now switching
 to a school that's much further from our house.
 Her bus drive on the school bus is like 45 minutes in a remote place.
 I was like, I want to be able to track and check that you're OK.
 Yeah.
 But also you're going to be bored for 45 minutes.
 Yeah.
 So did it arrive?
 Yeah, has arrived.
 Yeah.
 I need to set it up.
 I took her to the Apple store. We went on a little daddy daughter date to like one of my happy places went to Apple store for her to try all the
 phones out. You're sanctuary. And I was just like she just walked straight in and just walked to the most expensive phone. I was like,
 she is your child. She is my child. Who can blame her? And then I was trying to steer her ever so gently towards cheaper options.
 And she was quite pragmatic. She realized, I like this one. I was like, what do you like about it? She's like the color. I was like, you guys,
 you're gonna put a case on it and you'll never know what color is. Yeah, okay. Well, what do you
 think about this one? Yeah, like this one too. So she went back and forth. She went back and
 forth and she was very tactile holding them in her hand. But yeah, I like that edge. Yeah,
 I like that one. And so yeah, that's 12 year old. Good night. I remember when she was born.
 Do you remember when she was born? No, I do. Yeah. I remember it very well, actually. Yeah.
 Yeah. She came out weird.
 What do you mean?
 She came out fast.
 She went like an unright banana.
 She was yellow, wasn't she?
 No, she.
 Well, yes, because she had John this, but she turned yellower
 because she came out with this big bruise that sort of turned her.
 John, she looked like she'd been in a bar fight.
 Do you remember?
 Because people would be like, what happened to her eye?
 And I was like, you should see the other baby.
 Like, yeah, I just remember we had to put her in the daylight.
 Yeah, a lot.
 sunlight rather yeah they like yeah it's a vampire we try to actually hurt normal living
 but i just remember yeah we do we do all this babies are coated in fur when they come out
 fur
 can i do yeah this kind of little it's like it's like peach but yeah but it's kind of like fur
 I remember it.
 Listen, if she listens to this podcast,
 which is like Tony and dad said, I came out of the car.
 Well, you used to give her the black eye.
 She did.
 And a full head of hair, like full head of dark hair.
 She was the cutest little thing.
 But do you remember her head was like enormous?
 Her body was little.
 So her head was in the 90 something percentile.
 her body was in the first percentile.
 And so I'm looking at her and thinking, gosh, this seems not good because I hope she's
 growing into my head.
 She grows into her head.
 Well, she has.
 So sorry, sweetheart.
 Have you ever listened to this episode?
 Oh, my gosh.
 Yeah.
 It was like Sputnik or Jenna toothpick.
 I'm very excited.
 I made a purchase that I think is a theoretical joy giver.
  </li><li>Oh, do I know about this purchase?
  </li><li>I think so, I bought a pressure washer.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
 Yeah, I did.
 I was like, what is our theoretical joy giver?
  </li><li>Oh, it's like there's some satisfaction in pressure.
 I've only ever pressured washer something once,
 and that was the deck.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Do you remember that?
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>I wrote "Holly" from "The Broke" immediately.
  </li><li>That's right.
 Well, did it break?
 Don't say that on the podcast, I think they listen.
 (laughs)
 I'm just kidding.
  </li><li>I couldn't get it working.
  </li><li>Okay.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>I remember we did get it working
 'cause we ended up using it.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think we just had to ask her
 how there was something that, yeah.
  </li><li>Anyway, Amazon, I'm such a...
  </li><li>Sucker?
  </li><li>Well, I bought you something the same way today
 and you don't even know about it.
  </li><li>Really?
 You thought me a kid?
 Is it a theoretical joy gift or whatever you just said?
  </li><li>It's the most practical gift ever.
 So Amazon has something called the treasure truck.
 And every day about 10 a.m.
 They text you, it's a limited time deal.
 It just happens that day.
 And it used to literally be a treasure truck
 that would show up in Nashville at various spots.
 And you would say, yeah, I wanna buy it.
 And then you'd book your time of where it's gonna be.
 And it would just drive around Nashville and park.
 And it used to park in Whole Foods near our house.
 And we'd drive over and you'd just pick it up.
 They're usually deeply discounted.
 With COVID at the moment,
 they're not obviously doing a physical location,
 but they're still doing the treasure truck,
 which is a one day sale on a specific thing.
 And you got a date buy and then you delivered to it.
 So yesterday it was a pressure washer,
 which I don't know if it was a good one.
 So I went to the Sweet Home or Wirecutter.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And it was, it was a good one.
 And it was, it was deeply discounted.
 And so I said to you, hey, can we buy this?
 And you were like, why do you want a pressure washer?
 And I was like, well, we have a deck, we need to maintain,
 we pay somebody to do our driveway.
 And it might be that I get bored with this
 within about half an hour.
  </li><li>I imagine you will.
  </li><li>But I quite like the line.
  </li><li>Well, see, maybe I can do a little bit of filming
 of you pressure washing and we'll see how far you get.
 There is satisfaction.
  </li><li>Well, I remember, I remember it being very difficult
 'cause it wasn't as fun as I thought it would
 and I got really wet.
 I was also started in flip flops
 and I learned really quickly,
 do not pressure wash in flip flops
 Oh, your toes will be gone.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But yeah, I'm looking forward to that.
 Anyway, so I bought it, it just arrived just now.
 But today, do you know what today's treasure truck option was?
  </li><li>No, is this what I'm gonna be excited about?
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>I'm gonna come out for you.
 You know that oat milk you like?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Well, they're selling a six pack of it
 for a deep discount.
 So I thought you use it all the time.
 I bought you a six pack of oat milk.
 Don't ever say I'm not good to you.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Thanks, darling.
  </li><li>You're welcome.
  </li><li>Can I tell you what's in my drive market pack
 it just came like right before the podcast.
  </li><li>We should be sponsored by all these people, but go on.
  </li><li>A six pack of oat milk.
 So I should be good for like, you know.
  </li><li>I don't know how much you paid
 and then we'll compare how much I paid
 and bet my producer won.
  </li><li>I paid about $25.
  </li><li>Oh, I paid way less than that.
  </li><li>Good.
  </li><li>Either $11 or $17.
  </li><li>That's awesome.
  </li><li>See, you've done well.
  </li><li>I'm looking down at, oh, you know what else
 that came out this week?
 Apple had their worldwide developers' comforts.
 It's not too much stuff that's interesting.
 But you know how I know there wasn't too much stuff that was interesting?
 Because normally when there is a worldwide app on developers' conference, I come home
 and I must listen to all the newest things that I need to know about.
 My retelling of it.
 Yes, your retelling of it.
 Usually in real time.
 And then I am subjected to watching the clips of the things that you feel that I really
 must watch in order to understand fully how wonderful this thing was.
 And you didn't do any of that.
 And you know what else I haven't done?
 What?
 solve any of the beta software on any of my devices. I can't tell if that's lazy
 for maturity. Well, let's go for maturity. Yeah. What did I make you do last night
 though? Because that was the other thing they announced this week. I was
 thinking like have a bath. Oh, listen to the music. Yes. So, Apple have released
 two new things. If you're an Apple music subscriber, which we are, they've
 released two things, one which is meh, and the other which I thought would be
 Mac, but it's actually quite cool. The first one is lossless music, which to be honest,
 99% of people can't tell the difference between lossless and compressed music anyway, so that
 doesn't make that much difference. That's all you get ish. All right, go ahead.
 The other one is spatial audio, which they don't really release for movies. So you're
 probably familiar, you go to a movie theater and they're surround sound. Well, they managed to
 put that into their tiny little headphones that if you're watching a movie on your iPhone or your
 iPad, it would do virtualized surround sound, which I thought would be
 now, but is actually surprisingly great.
 Yeah, it's really cool.
 But I don't tend to watch movies on myself on my iPad because I have giant TVs in my
 house.
 Well, they took that same technology and they
 re-bundled it into their music, which makes a lot of sense.
 But I think a lot of people were skeptical about how good it would sound.
 It just so happens that last night we in our living room, we actually have a Dolby
 mouse surround sound, which is not just front, left and right and rear, but also height,
 you know, so it's sound everywhere. And they've remastered some tracks. And so I thought,
 I'll just try, I'm used to listening to it in my headphones, but by golly, it was quite
 impressive. It was lovely, wasn't it? Yeah. So I'm just now waiting for some of my favorite
 worship people to re-release tracks or release feature tracks encoded in Dolby Atmos. If you
 We have no idea what I'm talking about on your own AirPods and you're an Apple Music
 subscriber.
 Try it out.
 Pick one of your favorite songs.
 Make sure it's encoded in Dolby Audio.
 And away you go.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Nerds delight.
 There you go.
 Our topic for this week came out of a question that we got asked a couple of weeks ago.
 Do you remember the question we had from one of our listeners all about revival?
 Yes.
 And I was thinking about what I was thinking about and how we ended up in this topic is
 how revival can't save you and how revival won't save you.
 Only Jesus can save you.
 And I was thinking about maybe one of the curious things was when I moved to Toronto and
 you introduced me to friends or family or family, friends or you know, and I would say,
 oh, how do you know them?
 And you would say, oh, I knew them in the revival and there would be like a past tense
 sadness in your voice and I would ask a little bit about that. And these were people who grew up
 in revival with you, who encountered the same things as you, but now, you know, 10, 15 years later
 are no longer walking with the Lord. Yeah. And I remember being so confused because surely,
 surely, if you saw the miracles that you saw, surely if you're in the presence of God,
 you would dedicate your life to following Him and like, if anything's going to lock you in,
 Yeah. It's going to be revival. Yeah. And I realized that's not the case. No, I mean,
 when you think about some of those people, we literally saw deaf ears open, blind eyes see,
 AIDS getting healed, marriage is getting restored. We all saw the same things, heard the same
 testimonies and the miracles weren't enough. The what weren't enough? Miracles.
 Well, I was also thinking that as weird as that was for me, I realized that, biblically, it's not
 unsurprising. Okay. Because if you think about the people of Israel who were rescued out of Egypt,
 and literally saw signs, wonders, and miracles. And then, you know, a couple days later, they're like,
 build us an idol, you know, build us a golden car so we can worship it. Like,
 literally saw the stuff that we're all longing for, and it wasn't enough to keep them.
 And then we've been here.
 But also, often it wasn't a couple days later.
 Sometimes it was a generation later.
 That it was the generation that didn't experience it,
 but just had the hand me down stories.
 But sometimes it was the very people who had experience.
 Who just walked away and you're like,
 what is going on?
 Yeah.
 And then we've been here 12 years.
 We've run a school for 10 years.
 It's our 10 year anniversary of SSL.
 And I think the other curious thing is like,
 SSL is interesting in that it's an incubator where you've got hands on
 Involvement with students for eight months and you watch them flourish and there's this curious dynamic. That's not unique to our school
 But I think it's I think it's consistent with Christian experiences
 You I've now learned that I have an inability to predict who's going to quote-unquote make it as in who's going to continue
 walking with the Lord. That you give me a hundred people, it's folly of me to even think,
 "Oh yeah, they're sold out." They're all going to make it. Yeah.
 I can't tell who doesn't, who doesn't make it. And so I was thinking about that, I've been
 praying about that, I've been considering that for years, it's something that we've processed a lot.
 And I was thinking about some of the key ingredients that I've witnessed in the lives of people who
 have got 20, 30, 40 years track record walking with a Lord. And then coincidentally, what's the
 word similar, the people who have fallen away from the Lord who are currently no longer welcome
 with the Lord, there's some predictable patterns that you could see emerging the lives of people
 who are going to begin to take a hard left. And I wanted to talk a little bit about that and kind
 kind of unpacked some of that.
 Okay.
 So that's largely where we're going.
 Okay.
 Also, these are like kind of the collection of thoughts
 that brought us to this topic.
 A couple of years ago, Chris Valleton from Bethel
 was in town and he did a, I don't know,
 like a Wednesday evening or a Thursday evening
 with our staff.
 Remember he wasn't in town for the weekend,
 but he was in town and so we hung out with him.
 He did like a Q&amp;A for our staff and ministered to us
 for a bit.
 And he talked about the same thing.
 He said that 'cause Bethel school has been running
 far longer than ours. But he said, what I learned is that those that shine the
 brightest burn the fastest. So he said, for years, you know, you'd have these
 superstars who always had the most amazing testimonies and were all seen
 amazing miracles and signs and wonders. And what I learned is don't pay too much
 attention to that because that's actually not an indicator of long term fruitfulness.
 Right. Yeah. There's got to be more to it than that. You're right. It was the
 people who were just quiet and unassuming and who just kind of lack
 class or just did what we asked, just were on time to class, did their assignments and
 were just kind of like quiet, but they just long term produced more fruit over the course of,
 you know, 15, 20 years than the people who were like, you know, saving a loss and doing signs,
 100 miracles in year one, but by year two or year three, they had just completely left the Lord.
 And I was just, the whole thing's fascinating to me, like, how does it work?
 Yeah.
 So I've got some thoughts.
 I have some thoughts too.
 Do you want to go first with your thoughts?
 Um, sure. Well, I don't know what your thoughts are in order, but we're just having fun, aren't we?
 We're always having fun.
 We're always having fun, but you probably have a list.
 Well, I have a little, well, this is all I thought of is I thought about some things
 that well, here's what I thought. I thought the key component for people who've made it with a
 Lord is they've made their connection with Jesus. Because by the way, Jesus is the only person who
 can save you and can continue to save you. It's not your effort, it's not your discipline,
 it's not the kind of church you go to, it's none of those things, it's Jesus and your
 connection to Jesus. And so I... And it's not even about what he does for you either,
 because I think sometimes people get lost in that as well, is well, we were good. I mean,
 we had relationship, but I asked for this, or I went through this horrible season, and so now I'm
 I'm confused as to who he is.
 So it's no longer about relationship.
 It's about, you know, well, being fair with our friends,
 but that's not how we view when we go through it.
 You know, like I, I think I sort of,
 I think one of the things for longevity,
 and I don't know where this is going to be on your list,
 is going through difficult seasons,
 going through things where it looks like
 I'm getting answers to nothing,
 not in the space and in the tension of that,
 writing a new theology that God is different
 from who you knew him to be when you were happy
 and having a good day.
 You know what I mean?
 That Jesus is actually the same yesterday, today and forever,
 that he's still good and he's still kind
 and he's still faithful
 in the midst of whatever circumstances you're in.
 I think one of the things that I've watched happen
 for people that fall away is they start to write a new theology
 or they start to question what they've always known.
  </li><li>Do you read all my notes?
 Is this where we're going?
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>Just being super revelatory.
  </li><li>When your heart is hurt,
 It's the most natural thing to start writing story.
 And just as much as I can write story about you
 or anybody else, I can start to write story about God.
 And I think it's probably a protection mechanism thing,
 but it leads us to a place where we start to question faith.
 And I think that's one of the things that's difficult.
  </li><li>Point number five on my list.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>All right, no, you're--
  </li><li>No, it's got a point number one, I'm sorry.
  </li><li>No, no, no, no, no, apologies, it was absolutely brilliant.
 All I thought about was,
 is our connection to Jesus as paramount.
  </li><li>Oh yeah. - So I thought about things
 that help strengthen connection,
 and then I thought about things that weaken connection,
 and you just nailed number one of the things
 that weaken connection.
 So the things I've got for strengthening connection,
 can I start in concentric circles?
 Is that right?
 Like little circles that begin to go out now?
  </li><li>Sure, let's call it concentric.
 I'm sure that's what it's called.
  </li><li>Is that what it's called?
 I'm looking at it.
  </li><li>I don't know.
 I think that's right.
  </li><li>Okay, I'm looking at the intro.
  </li><li>Let's go with that. - Yep.
  </li><li>He has an English accent.
 He must be well educated.
  </li><li>He must know.
 Yes. - That works.
  </li><li>Well, so let me make it very, very clear that
 your connection with Jesus is the thing that saves you.
 It's not even your connection.
 It's the finished work of Christ's death
 and resurrection that saves you.
 So it keeps us safe, but staying connected
 and living out of that truth and that reality
 that theology is so vitally important.
 So what are the things that help you stay,
 the help connection to Jesus?
 Number one that I've got,
 which is your personal responsibility,
 nobody can do this for you
 is your own devotion to Jesus.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And that was the thing I'm so grateful for
 that was impressed upon me from an early age,
 that your devotion, and by devotion,
 I mean, you've gotta feed yourself.
 The reason that people grow in ministry schools
 is that someone feeds them for them.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>We say this all the time, like when you come
 to our ministry school, we will ensure that you have worship
 every day that you come.
 We will ensure you get taught,
 we will ensure that you are discipled,
 We will ensure that you're challenged.
 We will ensure that you're reading your Bible.
 We will ensure that you are praying to Jesus.
 Like we create an environment
 that fosters all of that for you.
 But the truth is if we don't learn to do that for ourselves,
 if we don't learn to feed ourselves,
 if we don't learn to read the Bible,
 if we don't learn to pray,
 if we don't learn to worship,
 if we don't learn to take communion,
 and if we don't do that on a regular basis,
 we will spiritually atrophy.
  </li><li>Yes.
 And that is the mainstay of Evangelicism.
 Like in the brethren where I grew up is
 that was your bread and butter.
 And when I became a charismatic,
 I just assumed everybody had that as a foundation.
 And I'm shocked to find out
 people don't have that as a foundation.
 That is not a norm for most non-evangelical churches.
  </li><li>Right, but I think that's why
 Evangelicals make such great river people
 is because they have that firm foundation.
  </li><li>Great foundations.
  </li><li>And then you add in the Holy Spirit to that
 and there's actually something to house it
 and maintain character.
  </li><li>That's a great kindling for the fire.
 But let me be, if you're listening to this,
 please take this as a wake up call.
 I don't mean this in condemnation,
 but if you have not cultivated the fine art
 of feeding yourself, the reason they're called
 daily devotionals is it's an outward act
 of your devotion to Christ.
 Rehearing the Bible, pray,
 I was taught as a child,
 read your Bible, pray every day and you'll grow, grow, grow.
  </li><li>It's a little song, isn't it?
  </li><li>Yeah. - Which I don't want to say.
  </li><li>I think I remember your mother singing it actually.
  </li><li>But again, I looked like devotion so important.
  </li><li>And to be honest, I'd hit some one of my pet peeves.
  </li><li>Tell me the pet peeves.
  </li><li>Well, this is like sort of side by birth, sort of not.
  </li><li>Is this about me being in the bath
 and letting the water out?
  </li><li>No, it's not about that.
 So you're talking about like feed yourself.
 One of the things that I remember hearing,
 and not so much recently,
 but I remember hearing a lot when I was,
 you know, just a new Christian is people
 that would skip churches or go to different churches
 and they'd say, "Well, I just didn't feel fed there.
 "I'm not feeling fed here."
 And I remember thinking, "What are you talking about?"
 Like, it is not your pastor's responsibility
 to feed you on a Sunday morning.
  </li><li>And furthermore, if you're only eating once a week,
 you're a malnourished.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And don't be picky.
  </li><li>Right, so be feeding yourself,
 I don't wanna shut on anybody,
 but be feeding yourself every day.
 And on Sunday morning is a time to come together
 in fellowship, right?
 To actually experience the Lord together
 and have like community and get challenged or whatever.
 But if you're looking for the only place
 that you get fed on Sunday morning,
 no wonder you don't feel fed
 because you're basically fasting.
 You know, you're fasting six days a week
 and then expecting somebody else
 to do the feeding for you on the seventh.
  </li><li>Pet peeve over.
  </li><li>Pet peeve over.
 All right, well that's the central circle
 of my concentric circle diagram.
  </li><li>I like it, next one.
 The next one out slightly broader is community.
 Like pay attention, first of all, you need community,
 pay attention to the type of community you have.
 I forget who said this,
 but some brilliant person quipped this.
 But basically you become the lowest common denominator
 of the people you hang out with.
  </li><li>Yeah, okay.
  </li><li>And so pay attention to who you hang out with.
 I don't just mean like relational hanging out.
 Like that could be your community,
 but I've noticed it's so much easier
 to have a virtual community too.
 like pay attention to the community
 that you're introducing your spirit to.
 What podcast are you listening to?
 What websites are you reading?
 Who are you following on social media?
 Even if you don't know them.
 Like we get emails all the time from people who are like,
 I feel like I know you because podcasts
 are inherently relational.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Like we're having a conversation here,
 even though you're not talking, we're just talking.
 And you feel like, oh, I get to know these people.
 In one sense, there's an element of community
 where you're connecting yourself to your,
 pay attention to that level of community that you have,
 what are you listening to, what are you feeding yourself?
 Remember, Booker Prover says one man's way seems right
 till another presents his case.
 If the only source that you are in regular connection with
 is a critical one, it's gonna weaken your connection to Christ.
  </li><li>Yeah, and I think too, like I don't know
 what the technical term is for this,
 but I think there isn't there a thing where,
 this is gonna, you're gonna really have to help me
 with technical terms here.
  </li><li>Okay, here we go.
 where you're surfing Instagram or whatever.
 And basically the kind of stuff that you choose to watch
 produces more of the same kind of stuff.
 So--
  </li><li>The algorithm serves up what you engage with.
  </li><li>What you tend to engage with most.
 So you can end up actually with a really faulty perspective
 of what's going on.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And thinking you have a great worldview
 where actually you don't, you have a worldview
 that's created by an algorithm
 that is sending you the same information.
  </li><li>And what's worse is if--
  </li><li>That's affecting what you're bringing in to yourself.
  </li><li>Well, also, if you're not devoted to Christ,
 then your biggest source of influence,
 and you know what a source of influence to you
 is how you spend your attention.
 Where you spend your attention--
  </li><li>And your frustration.
 Where do you spend your frustration?
  </li><li>Like, so if you, like, you know,
 you have two people browsing the same feed.
 If you're anchored in Christ,
 you're gonna know what's coming up is nonsense.
 But if you don't, you might be like,
 Well, they make a good point.
 And so much error gets introduced by us thinking
 they make a good point.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>If we're not anchored in Christ.
 All right, next bigger circle.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So you've got the motion. - Number three.
  </li><li>You've got community.
 Then I want to scale it up to your church community.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>The probably number one predictor of spiritual calamity
 in your life is you making a decision
 to stop going to church.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I say that with 10 plus years of experience
 of watching the downfall of believers.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Is for whatever the reason I'm taking a break,
 I'm just not getting fed,
 I just think there's more to the Christian life than church.
 But whatever the reason, no matter how good it sounds,
 it is the number one predictor of-
  </li><li>Falling away.
  </li><li>Spiritual falling away.
 And so I'm not talking about just bum and seat.
 I mean, find a church that you can be involved in,
 that you can be committed to, that you can be connected with,
 Because that will anchor you.
 There's like safety in numbers
 and you finding your tribe,
 finding the people that you love,
 the people that you wanna be with.
 It's harder to make dumb decisions
 if there's other people there
 to call you on the consequences of your dumb decisions.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
 But then that also involves allowing people,
 other people to speak into your life
 and be able to be truthful
 without having to step on eggshells with you
 and things like that too.
  </li><li>Well, that's also the thing.
 If you belong to something,
 much harder to fall for anything. If you've got connection, I remember being in
 Belgium Chapel in Edinburgh. On the one hand, my spirit is experiencing all
 this supernatural stuff. I remember being really hungry to be around
 believers who knew how prophesying dreams and visions and angels and all
 that sort of stuff. I didn't have any of that, but what I had was incredible,
 secure attachments in a healthy community. Every Thursday night, or I think every
 or every second Thursday, we would have our Bible study together.
 And it was beautiful and there's like a tribe of six or seven other people who know me,
 who are walking with me, we're studying the scriptures together.
 Some of the fondest memories I have of my Christian experiences being in small groups,
 part of a larger church community. And so I want to encourage you, find a church that you can
 belong to, that you can connect to, that you can get yourselves in life groups, the
 discipleship groups, friendship groups or whatever it is, because that is absolutely pivotal.
 Yeah.
 You ready for my last concentric circle?
 What is your last concentric circle?
 It's obedience.
 It's a lifestyle of obedience.
 I think it was Eugene Peterson that wrote the book about long obedience in the same direction.
 I wish I'd written that book just for the title alone, along obedience in the same direction.
 I've found that if we walk out our faith, if we work out against a backdrop of constant
 obedience to God, it reinforces our connection. Your faith does not work in theory. I mean,
 theoretically, it's correct, but it's meant to be lived out. If you believe one thing, but live
 another, you actually believe the other. You believe the other. Scripture says that if you only read
 read the word and don't do what it says, you deceive yourself.
 So one of the key aspects of deception
 and erosion of connection with God
 is not obeying what he has asked you to do,
 but because we're talking positively,
 one of the ways that you can strengthen your connection
 to the Lord is to be obedient in all areas of your life.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Thoughts, comments, criticisms, observations.
  </li><li>Well, my biggest thought with that is again,
 sometimes we say things like,
 well, actually God isn't speaking to me
 about anything right now. - Oh, I love that.
  </li><li>And my thought is what we often say to people,
 then go back, figure out what the last thing
 was he asked you to do and do it.
 Because I don't think that he's gonna keep asking us
 to do things while we keep not listening and not,
 eventually he's gonna wait for us to just do,
 do what I asked you to do the last time I asked you to do.
  </li><li>Right.
 The notion that we don't have current revelation
 when we have a book of it sitting next to our bedside
 is laugh about it. - Right, yeah, but you have
 exactly, yeah. - I have a book.
  </li><li>You have a guide book for everything.
 And sometimes the problem is what he's asking us to do is not the sexy thing we want to
 do.
 No, it's usually the hard thing.
 It's usually stuff like forgiveness and restoration and...
 And let your gentleness be evident to all.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 This stuff that we're like...
 No, it doesn't feel so much fun.
 Yeah.
 Well, that's my concentric circles of staying connected.
 I like it.
 Would you like to hear my concentric circles?
 I don't even know the concentric circles.
 Would you like to know my ingredients that weaken your connection?
 Uh, sure.
 I mean, if it sounds sad, but let's...
 Yeah, let's go there.
 Well, it's sad in that here's the things that gets passed off as freedom of choice,
 as opposed to ingredients that will absolutely shipwreck your faith and destroy your life.
 Okay, good.
 So, like, if you're doing any of the things I'm going to read out next,
 please, for the love of all that has wholly stopped doing them.
 Yeah.
 No matter what intellectual reasons you can come up with that make it sound good.
 These are terrible life choices, and I say this as a pastor who's invested in the lives of people.
 Yes.
 I'm serious.
 I'm a serious as a heart attack here.
 All right, hit me with your list.
  </li><li>Well, the first one is exactly the one that you said,
 that allowing obstacles to talk you out of promises
 is one of the most dangerous things
 that can happen in life.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So things come along, you get sick,
 your job promotion doesn't come true,
 your prophetic words don't come true,
 obstacles that are designed to strengthen your faith
 actually allows you to dismantle your faith.
 And it's a horrible thing to do.
 And we need to know, and I, again, I don't want to be critical of charismatic church,
 because I love charismatic, and I am a charismatic, and I go to charismatic church,
 and I help lead a charismatic church.
 But I don't hear a lot of messages about navigating sucky things in life.
 Whereas I heard a lot of that going on.
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong>
 But James chapter 1 verse 2, "Consider it pure joy whenever you face trials of many kind."
 No!
 Let's not consider it.
 Let's just quote verses at it.
 So those trials go away and I'm more than an overcomer in Christ.
 Listen, if all of your faith amounts to bookmarks that you can quote,
 but you actually have no experience, you're, you're a baby Christian and you're
 susceptible being tossed around by, you know, every new teaching, which also happens.
 So obstacles, things that get in the way of your promises are designed by God to
 make you mature, complete and lack nothing.
 But too often they seem to be reasons for people to tap out.
 Yeah.
 I don't want to say it too harsh.
 I think that's true.
 And again, I mean, that that brings me out and we talked about this a couple of
 weeks ago, but that brings me back to, to things like Ben Farley and things like
 that where it's like, I, my number one lasting, uh, I mean, there's lots.
 I remember about Ben obviously was just an absolute joy, but I just remember, you
 know, here he is sick, so sick and him saying I will not, like I will not allow
 myself to be convinced of anything other than the goodness and kindness of God.
 And I think too often when things aren't going well and we are allowing, we allow our hearts
 to go there and again we start to write this story.
 The then I think that that what that does is we think it gives us a freedom to examine
 or deconstruct but actually it's just introducing death and destruction essentially to some
 something that could have actually supported us through this.
 Right.
 And the tragedy is those obstacles are supposed to strengthen our faith, not giving us permission
 to dismiss our faith.
 Yeah.
 And I see it time and time again, people talking themselves out of something because the obstacles
 were too big and the obstacles were too big.
 And usually around that time they've distanced themselves from community and connection so
 they don't have the support that they need.
 Yeah.
 For people to come along and go, "I've been through this.
 I know how hard that is.
 Let me help you with that."
 I was also thinking about, if you think about the Hall of Faith out of Hebrews, you know,
 by faith, and then there's this list of people that actually didn't see the promise that
 they were believing the Lord for, but it was accounted to them as righteousness.
 And they endured the suckiest situations like being fallen in the earth.
 It's just horrible, horrible, right?
 So granted, none of us want that to be our testimony.
 No, no, that's not going in my Twitter.
 That's reality.
 Yep.
 That's how we want.
 The Lord sees everything, you know,
 and he's present with us in everything.
 If we will allow him to be,
 I think he's never the one that steps back,
 it's always us.
 So.
  </li><li>All right, number two, on my hit list
 of things that are gonna weaken your connection to God
 and prevent long-term fruitfulness.
  </li><li>Sugar.
  </li><li>Get behind me saying,
 sugar certainly won't help, for sure.
 My second one is false teachers and false teaching.
 Yeah.
 I've said this many times that the biggest threat to the early church was not persecution
 but false teaching.
 And the trouble is that some of the worst false teaching is the one that sounds most
 true.
 Yeah.
 It's usually taking God or what the Lord has said and twisting it, which by the way
 is the first thing that you see Satan doing Genesis 3 isn't it?
 Yeah.
 Did God really say?
 Yeah.
 So whenever you have a teaching that's calling into account, yeah, what God has already said,
 you want to slippery slope, but actually
 or the legitimacy of the Bible or
 deconstructive world.
 Yeah.
 It sounds like intellectual pursuit and
 it's actually a slippery pathway to hell.
 Yeah.
 And so we all think that would be great
 at spotting false doctrine and false
 teaching.
 Yeah.
 But actually, you know, Paul had so much to say
 about it.
 And it usually this is what's scary.
 It usually comes from the people who are among you.
 Yeah.
 So it is sugar.
 I missed it.
 I missed the lead.
  </li><li>Well sugar, it's sweet going down, you know,
 usually offered to you by somebody that you trust,
 but it feeds cancer.
  </li><li>I feel like that this.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I'm not writing a story here, but I feel like
 this might be a commentary on.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>No, but I'm like, I'm thinking,
 I'm just thinking about the stuff that we actually,
 anyway, we know about sugar, but I'm thinking,
 it is kind of like that, like it seems like a great,
 it seems like a great idea as you're ingesting
 whatever this thing is, you know,
 whatever this new thought is.
  </li><li>Well, my new thought is I'm gonna throw in a bonus one
 that ties one and two together.
  </li><li>Oh, good.
  </li><li>Is that be where about never being content with mystery.
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
  </li><li>So you have a disappointment, you have an obstacle
 and if you're not content to leave it in the hands of God,
 like I don't understand, but I'll trust you anyway.
 If you need to know that's usually a doorway to deception.
 People who are not content with mystery,
 like that's where most faulty doctrine starts.
 people who are not content with mystery.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Oh, all right, my last one.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>This is blindingly obvious, but not.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>It's allowing sin to be in your life.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I'm amazed like how quickly that we can justify sin
 we won't do and sin that we tolerate.
  </li><li>Okay, I've expound on that.
  </li><li>Well, obviously I am not tonight in any danger
 of refinancing a house, spending all that money
 on cocaine and hookers, and going to Las Vegas
 on a big blowout.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Right, that's just not
 something I'm gonna do, right?
 And that's a big obvious sin I'm not going to commit.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But I'm fine at times to just be critical
 and judgmental and call it discernment.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Or to eat too much sugar given we seem to go that.
 Or be gluttonous and think,
 well, at least I'm not like those people,
 but the sin of gluttony is as bad as, you know,
 insert whatever sin that we're all angry about.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So when we,
 don't realize that sin is crouching at the door.
 God said, "Sond as crouching at the door,
 "desires to master you."
 So any sin that we tolerate or justify
 as we're in control of, we're on the wrong side
 of righteousness. - Yeah.
  </li><li>So like envy, boastfulness, pride, jealousy,
 like the things that are commonplace
 and celebrated in our culture that we think are okay
 because we're fighting bigger battles.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 in deception. And so again, if there is sin that the Holy Spirit is speaking to you about,
 but you're ignoring, because you can point to all the right things you're doing,
 a little bit of leaven works its way through the whole batch. And so again, in the personal
 experiences that I've had with people who have fallen away, here's the other, this is the hardest
 thing, both sin and destiny start in seed form. Yeah. So, and the leaders in your life are given a
 gift to see into your life from a vantage point that you don't currently hold. So that's why the
 Lord Jesus could come along and say to Nathaniel, here's a true Israel in whom there's no guile.
 Yeah. Is that Nathaniel or Nathan?
 Jesus could meet this person and the guy was arrested like, how do you, how do you know me?
 I saw you sitting under the fig tree, you know?
 Yes.
 What?
 Jesus, now Jesus has an advantage in that he's God, but the principle remains the same.
 The reason prophets can call out destiny that nobody else can see is we see destiny in seed form.
 Leaders have that gift.
 That's why when leaders are building their team, they call people that other people are like, why would you pick them?
 There's something about them.
 And, you know, with the shepherd, the shepherd can look at their flock and inspect the flock.
 But in the same way that you can see greatness and call out in people, you can also see sin.
 And here's the problem. You have to trust your leaders who can see something that you are blind to.
 Yeah.
 So remember Jesus and Peter and he said, "Hey, you know, get behind me Satan."
 Peter thought it was being helpful and the Lord correctly identified that thing.
 That thing is from the pits of hell. It's not a good idea. So in our experience where we've walked
 with people where we've tried to bring confrontation to sin and p.s.
 Miners in not that there's any such thing like hey here's an area where you excel at here's an area
 I have to tell you this causes me concern. Yeah, and people don't want to pay attention to it
 I've seen that thing blossom and eat people up. Yeah, and it's so hard
 It's so hard to trust your leaders pointing at something you can't yet see. Yeah
 But that's one of the gifts that God gives leaders and it's a gift for you. Yeah, it actually
 reminds me of something that's we bear with me.
 Is it a sugar analogy?
 It's not a sugar analogy.
 It's not.
 Remember when we were living with John and Carol and they had like gardens everywhere
 and they were totally into their gardens.
 And I remember this, you know, they had been away for a few weeks and we came out, I came
 out one morning and John was pulling out of the garden, something that looked almost
 the size of a tree, like reefing it out of the garden.
 And I remember thinking, oh, I've watched that grow for the last couple of weeks.
 And it was really pretty.
 Like it had flowers on it, whatever.
 And I thought Carol had planted it.
 And he was reaping out.
 I said, you know, oh, did you not like that?
 You know, and he's like, well, this is a weed.
 I mean, it's going to choke out everything else.
 It was the prettiest weed I'd ever seen.
 I mean, I was just like, and it was huge all of a sudden.
 Like it grew really fast.
 But my thought was like, oh, like first of all, left a huge hole.
 If I'd known what it was when I first saw it, I would have pulled it out, you know, because
 they were away.
 But I didn't know.
 I just looked at it and thought it was, you know, it was pretty.
 But he knew exactly what it was because it was something, it was an area he was responsible
 for and he knew he didn't put it there.
 And so, yeah, it just sort of made me think about that.
 Like, if you have leaders around you that you trust, then let them help you with the
 weeding process, you know, because actually it's going to leave a much smaller hole if
 gets dealt with when it first comes through. Well, you're right. If the leader is seeing in
 seed form, your only other option is to say, well, I don't actually believe you and allow it to get
 to the point where you can see the fruit of the sin in your life before you deal with it. But by
 then, it's a much bigger deal. Yeah. Yeah. So it's like, uh, yeah. Can I read you a Bible verse?
 Yme. I thought this verse, which I love the book of Jude, but I thought this verse summed it up
 brilliantly. It's called a call to persevere. Okay, says this, but dear friends, this is verse 17
 of Jude. Dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold. They said to
 you, in the last times there will be scoffers who follow their own ungodly desires. These are the
 people who divide you who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the spirit. But you,
 You dear friends, by building yourselves up in the most holy faith and by praying in
 the Holy Spirit keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord
 Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life.
 Be merciful to those who doubt, save others by snatching them from the fire, to others
 show mercy mixed with fear, hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh, to him
 who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his glorious presence
 without fault and with great joy. To the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and
 authority through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages now and forevermore. Amen.
 And I just thought that covers everything we've talked about and ends with the whole
 thing we started with. Listen, it is only Jesus Christ who can keep us. Long-term fruitfulness
 Actually, it looks boring.
 Yeah.
 But it's a life of satisfaction.
 Don't concern yourselves when it feels like other people are getting ahead or they're getting promoted in a fashion.
 Just being faithful is so overrated.
 Yeah.
 Underrated.
 Being faithful is not sexy.
 So underrated.
 Underrated.
 But actually it produces long, long, long, long, long term fruit.
 Yeah.
 Steady on.
 All right.
 I'll listen to this question for you.
 I don't know if we can answer this because I don't think we've ever actually experienced
 the thing that they're asking about, but let's just answer it theoretically.
 How do you resolve a conflict with each other after a fight?
 So let's just imagine that we've ever had a fight as a married couple.
 How do we resolve a conflict?
 How do we resolve a conflict?
 Yeah, go and take it away, Dr. Phil.
  </li><li>Well, usually you are faster to get to where you can do that than I am.
  </li><li>Stop, stop.
 Say that again.
 Slow, but louder and use my name.
 Go on, Tarnas.
  </li><li>Sweet, Alan.
 You usually are looking to resolve it faster than I am.
  </li><li>I usually need some space and I need to get away.
 Chat with the Lord.
 Figure out what I'm feeling that usually takes me a while.
 I contemplated before I could come back and actually even look at whatever it was we were upset about.
 Thankfully, it doesn't happen that often. But, and then usually you help us do it because you're so much better at
 helping identify needs and things. That is very generous, but I would say that very generous
 description is only true of the last two years. That's true. I would say that, you know,
 Prior to that, I was very good at helping you understand what you did wrong and I would win the argument in a very eloquent way.
 That is true.
 I was more interested in being right.
 Historically.
 Yes.
 But the last two years, totally different.
 And I still think it's way too generous, the description that you can.
 But you know, I'm going to take it because you abused me about sugar earlier.
 So Chris, if you could add all the stuff that's sugar out and then maybe put like big echo delay on her words, that would be beautiful.
 Usually you are faster to get to where you can do that than I am.
 Sweet Alan.
 You usually are looking to resolve it faster than I am.
 So you have to go away.
 Like what happens when you go away?
 Like when you have to go away and contemplate and think and calm down.
 Like what's going on inside you?
 Well, so I'm usually not good at identifying what has just happened.
 Like if you were to ask me in the moment, are you sad?
 Are you angry? Are you I'd be like, yes, I'm all of it.
 And they're all like playing together in one big ball.
 And you should back away slowly so that I can actually.
 But I mean, it's all pretty internal.
 Yes, I'm aware of that.
 But I I often have no idea why I'm now feeling the way that I'm feeling.
 And so I actually have to get away. I need Holy Spirit's help.
 And sometimes I actually just need to get away and vent a little bit.
 And then I can ask the Lord to help me with.
 I don't know what I'm upset about.
 I don't know.
 You know.
 This is not a trick question.
 It's just a genuine curiosity.
 How often would you say when you're in that feeling where
 you're aware that's a burning hot lava core inside you?
 But you don't know what's causing it.
 Is that in hindsight, is the issue that you're upset about,
 not really the issue?
 Oh, probably 100% of the time.
 So 100% of the time when your emotions are really big
 and you're fizzing.
 I would say it's probably anytime that we've gotten there.
 And I am thankful it's not often.
 There's usually been a number of little offenses along the way that I haven't
 identified or I've identified and went, oh, it's fine.
 It's fine.
 And never actually come to you and say, Hey, babe, I felt really hurt when you
 bow, you know, and so haven't done any of that process stored up the,
 whatever.
 And all of a sudden this little thing is like, that's, and I've done, you know,
 And then at that point, it's you're like the worst person ever
 and whatever.
 And I know all the things that I'm thinking are not actually true,
 but I'm so--
 Fizzing.
 You feel fizzing, yeah.
 And so I actually know, oh, I need to get--
 I need to be away.
 Because I don't want to say things I don't mean.
 Or do things you don't.
 Like, you literally threatened to poop in my shoes once.
 Yeah.
 Which is still fine.
 Faze for it.
 I don't know why.
 It might be like 11 years ago.
 And you were awful.
 But anyway, I did.
 I was awful because I was literally
 the guy who I do this.
 I'm so angry.
 How would that get me back because you
 would end up having to pay for new shoes?
 I think I was thinking in my head, we had no money
 at that stage.
 So you wouldn't get new shoes.
 I have to explain what happens to my shoes.
 I don't know why, but I still think that's the funniest in such out of character.
 I was so mad.
 I was so pregnant.
 I remember that.
 I remember that day.
 I remember like I was so bad.
 Yep.
 I'm trying to teach your lesson, but I wasn't going to come home and then the Holy Spirit
 was like, where are you going to sleep?
 I'll get a hotel and the Lord is like, you can't even afford a Starbucks right now.
 Are you going to afford a hotel or no shoes?
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>Yeah, so you called Jeff.
  </li><li>Yeah, when he was like, okay,
 whoever apologizes first wins.
 I'm not apologizing.
  </li><li>Yeah, that whole, you know,
 whenever the reaction is larger than the event warrants,
 the issue is not the issue.
  </li><li>Yeah, but the question was about
 how do we resolve it, right?
  </li><li>How do we resolve it?
  </li><li>So we take time if we need time,
 and usually I'll have to tell you, babe, I need time.
 I just need, you know, sometimes we can go the right away.
 Sometimes I just can't.
 I need space.
 I need, you know, whatever.
 So we will usually agree.
 Okay, we're going to talk in an hour.
 We're going to talk.
  </li><li>We need to agree.
 So I'm so like polite and calm.
 Yes, none of that sounds great.
 Yeah, I'll have my people sketch.
 Usually it's a fun, fun.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Again, usually I'm sitting here right now
 and I can't think of the last thing that we have.
  </li><li>I can't either.
  </li><li>You can't?
 I remember a couple of days ago,
 but that wasn't even an argument.
 I snapped at you or you snapped at me.
 I think it was I snapped at you.
 You said something and I snapped at you and I'm just like,
 "Hey, I'm gonna be sorry for snapping at you.
 This is what happened."
 But that was in the space of 30 seconds.
  </li><li>Yeah, I don't even remember it.
  </li><li>I can't remember the last time we had a big.
  </li><li>But anyway, whenever that does happen,
 whenever we come back and talk, we're usually still--
  </li><li>Well, let me just clarify.
 I'm not trying to make a sense.
 Like there are plenty of them.
 And we've talked about a lot of them on the podcast.
 When that has happened.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>So I'm not trying to suggest it.
 'Cause I can't remember anything.
 It's so rare.
 We are absolutely human and we do have fights.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 But we come together and we usually both sort of use the format
 when you said whatever I heard and we talk about
 how did that make us feel and then you usually lead us
 in a hole like what do you need, what do I need?
  </li><li>Usually, I don't, I mean, but the only times I can think
 that's worked well is when Europe set and I'm not upset. So I've got enough
 presence to go, babe, I know that you're upset. And I'm curious what's happened.
 And you exercise huge levels of trust in those moments. Because historically, I
 would be leading you through those questions to prove that you're just an
 over emotional, super dramatic. And I'm just the innocent part in this. And look,
 I can prove it. Yes. Right. So the amount of trust that you have to demonstrate that
 I'm not doing that is really humbling for me and I am trying with the the flummoxing
 tools I have
 Because I am genuinely curious like why is my wife in pain? I'm missing that
 I don't think I've ever done that when we're both upset that usually only works when you're upset and I'm not yeah
 And probably the other way around probably usually most of the time it's one or the other of us that's more upset than the other
 Yeah, well usually when I'm upset I come to you with I've done that process on my own
 Yeah, and I've come to you and I've said babe here's what's going on and I remember having lots of fears that that sounds like
 Hey, here's an excuse for all my behavior
 Can you come I don't think we ever talked about this usually when I've gone away and I've realized why I triggered
 Why I got so upset I come back and say
 Here's what was going on. Here's what I thought you said. Here's what I believed
  </li><li>Here's the story I wrote. - Yeah.
  </li><li>This is where I went, you know, would you forgive me?
 And I remember initially that I was worried
 that that might sound like I'm trying to make excuses
 for my behavior.
 As in, if you could understand why I was upset,
 then I don't have to be accountable.
  </li><li>Right. - Did I ever feel like that?
  </li><li>No. - Okay.
  </li><li>No, because usually you're still apologizing
 for whatever the thing was, or you're saying,
 "Hey, I actually need to hear from you.
 Is my story true?
 Is that what you were thinking?"
 'cause often I think historically for both of us,
 when we have gotten really upset with each other,
 it's been that we have assumed that we know the motivation
 of the other person's heart or why they said X,
 and like 99.9% time we're just not right.
 But we just think, well, I've known you for 15 years
 and I know that you had you said this, you meant--
  </li><li>So crazy the confidence that you and I have
 in thinking that we're right.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But equally how fastly--
  </li><li>And we're both typing personalities.
 So we're pretty.
  </li><li>But also how fascinating that even though we're confident
 we're right, we're willing to be persuaded we're not
 without much persuasion.
  </li><li>That's true.
  </li><li>So if I come and say, "Hey, I thought this,
 "is that true?" and you're like, "No babe."
 I believe you, I don't go, "Oh yeah, blah blah."
 So yay in our healing for that one.
  </li><li>Yay in our healing.
  </li><li>But usually it's go away, think, process.
  </li><li>Come back.
  </li><li>Come back with our part that we need to repair.
 And usually we don't come with a,
 sometimes I was gonna say,
 sometimes we don't have a laundry list
 of what we need from the other person,
 but sometimes we do.
  </li><li>Sometimes we have.
  </li><li>It's like, hey, I need to own this.
 And if the other person's like, okay, good.
  </li><li>Yeah, but I actually need you to own this.
  </li><li>I also need you to own this.
 Which I think is healthy in terms of bringing,
 here's what I need.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Here's what I need to do,
 and here's what I need from you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>All right, well that's, I think that's the best.
  </li><li>I don't even know if that answered the question.
 There we go.
  </li><li>How we solve conflict.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 All right.
 We're done.
  </li><li>All right.
