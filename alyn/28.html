<p> Mrs. Jones.<br/>
 Mr. Jones.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 I'm good.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 I'm good.<br/>
 Tell me about Romans.<br/>
 Romans.<br/>
 Well, I spoke on Romans last week at emanate.
 Romans 4.<br/>
 You did.<br/>
 I intended to speak on Romans 5, however, but Romans.
 That was a sequel.<br/>
 Romans 5 starts with one word that messed the whole plan up and that is therefore.
 So I had to go back to see what therefore was referring to and then I just ended up
 So enjoying Romans 4 that I decided to teach on Romans 4 last week.
 So I'll teach on Romans 5 this week.<br/>
 You did a great job.<br/>
 Thanks, darling.<br/>
 I know you're my wife and I should say stuff like that.
 But you and I both know I don't say stuff like that because I'm your husband.
 I said stuff because it's true.<br/>
 Thank you, sweetheart.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Um, we did a crazy thing this week.<br/>
 We took our staff from the school of supernatural life and we went to Nashville
 escape.<br/>
 So fun.<br/>
 which if you don't know what that is, they seem to be popping up all over the place.
 I saw a friend of mine posted something about one in Portland, but basically it's a,
 it's not a house, but you go to a building and in the building, like there are four
 different rooms and each room is a game and you basically get locked in the room and
 you have half, you have one hour to get out by falling a hole to close.
 Yeah, puzzles and t-building game.<br/>
 So we took our staff split ourselves up into two different rooms.
 Our small group leaders played one game.
 Our school staff are, uh, we played a different game.
 And I thought, this is so lame.<br/>
 I'm just doing it like teamwork and exercise.
 They're all even so boring and I always just want to cheat and get it over and
 done with, but within about 30 seconds, 30, I was going to say 20 seconds.
 I was like, Oh, I am so into this.<br/>
 This is amazing.<br/>
 You got so excited.<br/>
 It was so cute.<br/>
 And the premise was, at least for our one, we were hired to steal the painting from someone's office.
 And first of all, we had to break into their office and then saw the holder clues.
 And it sounds lame because I'd heard other people explain it to me, but I can't.
 It is so fun.<br/>
 It is.<br/>
 It's so I can't overstate how much fun it was.
 Like, I mean, it was adrenaline high.<br/>
 We got out with a minute and 30 seconds to go.
 Yeah.<br/>
 But we did hear that the success rate for the one that we did was only 27%.
 So 27% of people who go in actually do it.
 Yeah, actually complete it.<br/>
 That's amazing.<br/>
 So that's pretty cool.<br/>
 And it's there.<br/>
 They're quite clever in that you can't buy any of their stuff, like their stickers
 or their shirts or anything unless you actually escaped.
 So if you didn't actually escape your scenario, they won't sell you anything.
 But I did have to say it was a little bit lame.
 And because the lady was like, and if you beat it, you get to buy one of our t-shirts.
 I'm like, you don't give us a t-shirt.
 We have to buy one.<br/>
 He became eligible to be able to buy one.
 But it was awesome.<br/>
 I'm going to put a link to that in the show notes.
 This is big week for food because your air fryer.
 Arrived.<br/>
 I don't know if I'm just getting food cynical in my old age.
 And I don't know if it's because you have a Williams and Sonoma shopping addiction.
 I do.<br/>
 in that you buy almost, you know, or you're at least interested in every
 gadget. Thankfully, you don't buy every gadget.
 I don't buy every guy. I'm not. I wouldn't even say I'm interested in every gadget,
 but I'm interested in gadgets that would facilitate the kind of food that I make.
 That's the first step in denial, baby.
 You're unaware of how addicted you are. But nevertheless, you have a fine collection of
 cooking utensils. I do.<br/>
 And I wasn't sure why we needed an air fryer. And then I was even skeptical that it would work.
 but talk us through it. The air fire arrived and it's stinking amazing. You can cut up
 like two large sweet potatoes worth of french fries and I just put them in like a large ziploc
 bag and add less than a tablespoon of oil. Well, with two huge potatoes, I'd probably do
 more like two teaspoons of avocado oil or coconut oil or sesame oil, you know, something with
 a high burn temperature and mix it up with some salt, whatever, and just shove it in the air fryer.
 And that's the, there's no other oil involved. Like it is taking less oil than when I was baking
 it on sheets. And in 15 minutes. And 50 minutes you have crispy, gorgeous fries on the outside that
 that are like taste like they're like fluffy potato on the inside.
</p><ul>
  <li>Or even if even warm to the temperature,
 it needs to cook in 15 minutes.
  </li><li>Well, that's slightly over exaggeration.
 But yeah, we'd still be waiting another 20 minutes
 after that for our stuff for sure.
  </li><li>And then we're not gonna deep fry it.
  </li><li>No.
 But it tastes like it's been deep fried.
 I mean, it's just like, oh.
  </li><li>But then we're experimenting with everything
 we can make in the air fryer.
  </li><li>Yeah, potato wedges.
  </li><li>Yoga.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Yoga.
 -Well, Alan made bacon in it.
 -I'm not sure we're allowed to mention I ate bacon
 in case my physician listens to this,
 but yes, we made bacon and it was amazing.
 -But it's smoked out the house.
 -We made sweet potato hash, some fried eggs,
 and some maple syrup cured bacon, and it was delicious.
 -It was very yummy.
 -And I'm not apologizing for that, unless my physician--
 -You shouldn't.
 -He is, and then I apologize to say I'll never do again.
 Oh, I know what I wanted to say.
 I wanted to talk about honest roasters.
 So I went there for coffee this week
 and they make coffee with cashew milk.
 And it was amazing.
 I mean, I went back two days in a row, amazing.
 And-- - The cashews,
 how smaller nipples are larger nipples and almonds?
  </li><li>Larger, definitely larger.
  </li><li>So it's easier.
  </li><li>Yeah, much easier to milk with cashew.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And then I also went to the Thrive Cafe,
 which is next door to it, which is fantastic.
 And I had some Franklin juice.
 I mean, I was just healthy and juiced up.
  </li><li>You're just regular hippie.
  </li><li>I'm a hippie.
  </li><li>One other piece of information.
 We have a Frankel-Sare Parsons, a friend and a colleague.
 She and her husband are the pastors
 at the School of Supernatural Life,
 but she, in addition to being a great friend
 and a wonderful pastor, is a phenomenal painter.
 And we've been on and on at her for ages
 to put her artwork on display.
 And so she now has a website.
 If you go to parsonstudio.net, parsons, plural studio.net,
 you can have a look at some of her artwork.
 She's an oil painter.
 If you've ever been to any of our conferences at Grace Center,
 if you've streamed online and you've seen somebody painting,
 the chances are is probably Sarah Parsons
 and her paintings are absolutely beautiful.
 They're stunning.
 One of our most treasured possessions is one of her paintings.
 We, everybody who comes in and sees it as like, oh my gosh.
 Would you like some listeners questions?
 I would love some listeners questions.
 All right, Brandon wrote in and said, how do you survive in between the time that
 God starts revealing core pain and the time that he heals you?
 Um, Brandon, I think if God's revealing core pain, then that's because it's God's
 intention to start to heal you now.
 I don't think he reveals something that he isn't going to start working on right
 away.
 He's, you know, it's just that wouldn't be in line with the kindness of God.
 So I don't think you have to survive until he starts to heal you.
 I think that his revealing of it is his invitation for you to actually enter into healing now
 and pursue that.
 Rodge and Shell, so this, we're loving our podcast and enjoy listening to them out here
 in India.
 Yay, we love India.
 We live out in India and can't get to church so we've found listening to podcast teachings
 and reading books incredibly helpful.
 When we ask you what books have influenced you the most and what books you are reading
 just now, we'd love to get your Finding Father book, AJ, but it isn't available on the iTunes
 store here in India.
 Any chance of you changing that?
 Well, let's, three questions there.
 With regard to iTunes in India, I checked.
 I went into iTunes and Finding Father is available on every store that iTunes has worldwide and
 I didn't see India listed, so I'm not sure what's going on there.
 I mean, like India doesn't have a book.
  </li><li>Doesn't have an iTunes bookstore.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So, sorry about that.
 If you knew otherwise, then please just get in touch
 and we'll see if what we can do to make it available.
 Maybe it's a rights issue.
 Amazon definitely has India.
 You can get a finding father on Kindle, Amazon.
 But just shoot us an email if you have any problems
 and we'll love to help.
 But babe, back to these two questions.
 What books have influenced you the most
 aside from the Bible, I'm assuming,
 and what books are you reading just now?
  </li><li>Just now I'm reading a book called,
 a girl named Grace, or a girl called Grace,
 and written by General Le France, who's actually my cousin,
 which I'm super enjoying.
 I'm just beginning that book, and it's a fiction.
 What books have influenced you the most, babe?
  </li><li>Easy.
 Probably the most influential book I read outside of the Bible.
 The book that absolutely changed the course of my Christian walk with God is Dr. Jack
 Deers' book, Surprised by the Voice of God.
 It's actually a second book because first book was Surprised by the Power of the Spirit,
 which in itself was absolutely superb.
 But when I read Surprised by the Voice of God, I couldn't believe what I was reading.
 I remember being a guest and literal jaw drops at the stuff he was documenting in his book.
 And that's the book that got me started on the journey and the prophetic.
 And it was so well written, I read everything else that Jack's ever written.
 And his other, you know, his other book, "Surprised by the Power of the Spirit," was very, very
 helpful for me, especially from a conservative evangelical cessationist background in helping
 me understand that the things that the Spirit were for today, it absolutely reassured all
 the fears I had that I was being deceived, very, very helpful book.
 And then another book that I loved that just made the prophetic accessible was "You May
 all prophesied by Steve Thompson, which was really, really helpful for me.
 And interestingly, Book and Reading now, we, we, this is our two year anniversary being
 in this house babe.
 It is.
 And we have not unpacked any of our books.
 That is shocking.
 So all our books are still in our garage.
 And last night, I thought this is ridiculous.
 I'm going to start unpacking some books.
 I'm not last night a couple of days ago.
 And so unpacked them.
 And I found a very, very old book that is out of print.
 I actually had to buy a second hand because I was out of print when I wanted to buy it
 years ago. It's called "Some Set It Thundered" and it's by David Pichy's, Pichy's, David
 is a bishop in England. He wrote this book after his personal encounter with some of
 the prophets out in Kansas City. The book was written in 1991, 23 years ago. I started
 I'd read it many years ago, but I started rereading it the other day and was just
 chuckling about it. It's amazing book.
 It's amazing. It's really, you can get your hands on it. Um,
 but I'll tell you why I was chuckling about it later.
 I'm jumping head to what I want to talk about in the session.
 Did you ever tell me what your influential books were? Um,
 I'm just trying to think, I mean, I guess one of them would be just a tiny
 book called the importance of forgiveness by John and Carol Arnett.
 And, uh, I mean, it's life changing.
 I think in its first edition, it was 36 pages.
 It might be up to like 42 now, you know, with the subsequent editions, but it's an amazing
 little book that if you, you know, read it and do what it says, it changes everything.
 It's amazing.
 I also loved God's Generals.
 I always loved researching stuff anyway, but I loved reading about God's Generals and,
 No, Smith Wigglesworth and Mariah Woodworth,
 Edder and all those guys.
 So I like all that kind of stuff too.
  </li><li>Very good, I hope that helps,
 Raj and Shell.
 All right, baby, I'll talk about it for discussion this week.
 If you are an American, this week or the week
 that this is recorded in ACE Thanksgiving,
 and as a Canadian, you have a Thanksgiving,
 but as a British person, we never had Thanksgiving.
 So when I moved to Canada first,
 I didn't quite understand what the fuss was
 about Thanksgiving,
 I hope this doesn't offend any Canadians, but Canadian Thanksgiving versus American Thanksgiving,
 there seems to be more effort put into it in America than there is in Canada.
 I would say there's more effort put into every holiday in America than there is in Canada.
 Right, okay.
 Because Americans are really great at celebrating things.
 I would say Canadians are probably a little more low-key.
 So what is Thanksgiving in Canada?
 Thanksgiving in Canada. First of all, is much earlier. It's the first Sunday in October.
 First or second? I've been away too long. I can't remember.
 And it's the same idea. It's still celebrating the same thing, but it's basically celebrating
 the harvest. You had pilgrims in Canada? Well, it must have been settled at some point in time.
 Okay. That's not where your Thanksgiving came from though, right?
 It's the exact same idea.
 I mean, we would see things with like pilgrims and North American Indians and all that kind
 of stuff.
 But mostly it was a celebration of the harvest was coming in.
 So that's why it's earlier in the year because obviously being further north the harvest
 would come in earlier.
 And it's just a family thing.
 It would be maybe not as big a family holiday as Christmas.
 What do you do in Canada?
 Giving I guess the day is on a Monday, but typically you get with your family on Sundays
 So would is it an actual halt? Is everybody get Monday off? Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah, you get Friday and Monday off
 Okay, so you get a long weekend
 What's Friday called the Friday before Thanksgiving? Yeah, I mean nothing, you know
 so
 It was a long weekend and we used to just go up to the cottage and you know with all the cousins stuff
 So there'd be like 26 of us up there and they'd get a absolutely enormous turkey and then you'd have all kinds of other food
 Corn on the cob and you know, whatever and it was just basically a weekend of eating
 Playing games and stuff. Yeah, it was weird when I got there and everyone would be excited about Thanksgiving
 And I didn't know what it was or why you did it. It just seemed like a dry run for Christmas more
 More so than a meal. Yeah. Yeah, and then we got to America and
 Our first couple of years everyone's like, well, you're doing for Thanksgiving and we're like wait what now?
 And we weren't doing anything
 Part of it because we don't have a family here to celebrate Thanksgiving with and the other there was three of us
 We're the other part was we didn't have a heritage or a history of having Thanksgiving
 But now in our fifth year
 Well, we got invited and went to some other people's houses for Thanksgiving. It's great. We didn't understand why yeah
 But slowly we've begun to realize oh, this is a big deal and it's a nice
 concept, you stop and you think about what you're thankful for and it's a chance. It seems like
 and Americans, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but from the people I interconnect with, the people
 I connect with, it seems like Thanksgiving is a bigger deal for getting together with your families
 than Christmases. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's my observation.
 Well, or at least as big a deal, because it seems like when we married couples, we know
 they'll be like well we're spending thanksgiving with the wife's family so we're spending Christmas with.
 The husband's family you know whatever and it seems like there you know it's a good deal no matter what where.
 You know in Canada would be thanksgiving wouldn't be a good trade off for Christmas in terms of family time if that makes sense because it's one meal you know what the things are saying about is i think about how.
 It's fine we have no.
 History from Thanksgiving, right? Because we're new to it. But I'm thinking about how it's probably important that we introduce our children to Thanksgiving, given they're being raised as Americans.
 Yes.
 And it's a little tricky because I don't know any of the history behind Thanksgiving. I mean, sure the kids come home from first grade and can grade dresses.
 We just saw two Thanksgiving shows this week.
 They're buying pay attention during either of them because they're small children singing in air quotes.
 Yes.
 I need a good book on American history that's short.
 [laughter]
 So if anybody could write that, that would be awesome.
 Preferably with lots of pictures.
 [laughter]
 Maybe cartoon pictures.
 Maybe cartoon pictures.
 Because I was thinking the other day, like I was watching my kids eat quesadillas for dinner.
 And I was like, I don't know what quesadilla was until I came as an adult to America.
 You've never had a quesadilla in Canada?
 Well, I'm sure, but I could say North America, but still I was 30 by the time I knew what quesadilla was.
 And so I was thinking about all the common experience that I had growing up.
 My kids will never be on the receiving end of that.
 they will never be below the case of the poverty line.
 That's not what I'm saying.
 I'm just saying the stuff that's normal for me that I can remember from my childhood that we could joke about and that we have a natural bond about because I did that when I was a little kid and you're going through that same rite of passage is completely different over here.
 Right.
 So I need to go through a crash course of Americanism.
 Like, for example, our children haven't had to eat haggis.
 Right.
 They probably don't know who Ravi Burns is.
 No, nor do I.
 And I've never played a game of baseball in my life.
 But I know who Guy Fox is.
 Yes.
 They don't need to know that.
 It's interesting, being away from the UK and, of course,
 the 5th of November, just passed.
 But we celebrate Guy Fox night by building an effigy
 of a terrorist and setting him on fire.
 And that's a yearly celebration that we celebrate with children.
 Yeah, burn him.
 Wait, how's that good again?
 Remind me why we do this, yay!
 But anyways, thanksgiving.
 So I didn't want to be too cliche, and I didn't want to be too sappy,
 but I wanted to know what you're thankful for and why.
 What I'm thankful for and why can we go back and forth?
 Like I'll pick one thing that you do one thing, that sort of thing.
 I am thankful for living in America.
 And why?
 Why?
 I guess because...
  </li><li>quesadillas.
  </li><li>Yes, it's all about the quesadillas and the air fryers.
 No, because God awakened my heart
 to wanting to be here,
 and it seemed an absolute impossibility.
 And so like even before we got married,
 there was part of me that was always like,
 "Huh, I'd love to live in America at some point."
 So to me, it feels like, God, you're so good.
 You know, I'm so thankful that you not only awaken things
 our hearts, but then you open doors for us to be able to walk through them.
 I think that's a brilliant answer.
 Thank you.
 I'm in the season of life right now, personally with the Lord, where I feel like if we rewind,
 so if we rewind, I don't know, 10, 15 years ago, and I'm reading Jack Deere's books on
 surprise by the voice of God, and I'm reading about the prophetic, which I have hitherto
 never heard anything about. It's alien and foreign to me to think about God speaking
 to people through dreams and prophets and prophetic experiences and encountering angels
 and all that sort of stuff. That was so alien to me, so bizarre. So it took me so long to
 even believe that was real. And I remember being at the point of not desperation, but
 well, I guess desperation, but just real hunger for God to be able to even access any
 of that. And now fast forward 10 15 years, all of that is a very normal part of my experience.
 And I'm so thankful and so grateful that a God put that hunger in me for the prophetic
 for the supernatural. And then be not only put the hunger in but answered it, even when
 I didn't even know where to find it, if that makes sense. So I felt like, like God, I'm
 not even sure if I'm right to be hungry for this, like I'm not even sure if I'm stepping
 deception. I have no idea if this is real. I'm not sure if I'm spending, if I'm wasting time
 praying and fasting and seeking and studying all this stuff, what if it isn't even real
 only to find out which is more real than I could possibly ask or imagine.
 So, you know, that was 15 years ago. I find myself in a similar spot now where I'm hungry
 after things of God and I'm desperate for things of God, but I don't actually know the road map to
 get from my hunger to satisfaction. That makes sense. And I'm actually enjoying that process
 really because I'm looking back 15 years ago and going, "Lord, you did that then." And so I have
 confidence for you to do again. So I think I'm very, very grateful for the faithfulness of God
 and for the hunger of God and that there's always more that our life gets to be about plumbing
 the depths of God's affection for his people and us getting carried along in that. I think
 that's just phenomenal. And I spent much of my waking days just thanking God that I
 get to live life like that. I think it's amazing. Tag, you're it.
 Well, this is probably an obvious one, but I'm thankful for our kids.
 I'm thankful that they're healthy and they're fun and they're, you know, I don't know.
 I just, I think I'm enjoying all of them at the stage that they're at right now.
 It's fun to watch them grow and not only in their understanding of God, but just just grow and be
 fun. I mean, I suppose particularly MJ right now is just because he's a boy and he responds so
 different to everything. He's just super resilient and just so stinkin' cute.
 But I'm just super thankful for the kids and just how amazing they are and how much grace they
 give us and they're just awesome.
 Mm-hmm. This may feel like a repeat of what I just said. But I was talking earlier about that
 book some said it thundered and I was fascinated by a passage in it where David gets around
 a bunch of prophets. Some of who are now friends of ours, but in that room he just sat down
 with him and was just like, it was fascinating for me to read about a time that I didn't live
 in. But it was a time where the prophetic I guess was so new to church culture that he
 He sits down and asks these really rudimentary questions, a very valid question, but basically
 things like how do you get a vision?
 How do you hear from God?
 How did the gift start?
 And I was just thinking Lord, in 23 years you've got somebody who, this is David pitches
 or pikes, I don't know how you pronounce his name, I'm sorry if I'm butchering your name
 David, you know, who's a bishop, who's a, you know, somebody who loves the Lord dearly,
 who is a leader in the body of Christ.
 And yet, like an infant,
 and I don't mean that in a patronizing term at all,
 but like an infant is sitting at the feet of these prophets
 saying, "Please, this is so incredible.
 "Tell me how it works."
 And now to think 23 years later,
 that's normal for the culture we live in.
 Like it's normal in our church that we have a prophetic team
 where we have teams of people who've been raised up
 to be able to prophesy and hear the voice of God.
 And it's second nature is normal.
 I just think, God, that's amazing that we get to be part of that.
 So I think I'm thankful for that.
 I don't know how you'd file that, but I'm so thankful for Grace Center and for
 Jeff and Becky Dollar.
 You posted that on Instagram this week, but what a joy is to serve under
 healed up leaders and humble leaders.
 Amazing.
 It's amazing that climate that Jeff and Becky have created for their staff to
 follow in.
 I'm thankful for technology.
 And this is not a paid announcement from Alan Jones, but I just, I was just thinking like,
 even though we are here and really the only, you know, family that we have in this area,
 my cousins, which are amazing.
 But, you know, I miss people from Toronto and, you know, we talked to our friends Stuart
 and then they from New Zealand this week and stuff.
 And it FaceTime has just made it so much easier
 to be where God has you to be
 and still be able to be connected
 and feel like you're part of life with your mom
 and just the kids still getting to see her
 and she stings them over the phone
 and all that kind of stuff.
  </li><li>It does.
  </li><li>So I was just thinking I'm so thankful
 that we can still connect with your mom and John and Carol
 and all of our friends around the world
 And it feels like they're close because we can connect with them through a device.
 We're getting to see Tobias and see him get it bigger and all that kind of stuff.
 I'm super thankful for that.
 I'm super thankful for Franklin, Tennessee.
 Yeah, I love it here.
 I love living in this town.
 Is it a town?
 City?
 City of Franklin.
 Yeah, I love living in this city.
 I don't know what it was.
 Small city, maybe.
 It's a really small city, but I love, I love, you know, the other day I was driving to work and I had to stop in the care practice
 And so I love walking to our care practice and seeing you know, I'm thankful for our chiropractors
 Yeah, seeing our friends at the care practice office seeing our doctor getting adjusted hopping a car
 I had to go meet you or GP
 And so I love walking to the GP and everyone knows who we are in the practice
 So we can say hi to all them and then I get to drive through the rolling hills of Franklin
 which is just gorgeous.
 I just, I never thought I would love living partially
 in the country, but we drive in the countryside
 on our way to work.
 And then I love that, I've already mentioned grace,
 and I've got to love that we have an amazing staff,
 an amazing team, and I love that we get to, you know,
 lead the school and just watch lives get transformed
 in front of us and witness miracles.
 I just think that's amazing.
  </li><li>Yeah, and I would add that like,
 there's so many people that just help us
 get done what needs to get done that aren't even necessarily staff.
 You know, people that just come over and watch our kids and clean our house and do, you know,
 just so grateful for, um, wow, just it's, yeah, the family that God's put around us here.
 I'm grateful for you. Thanks, baby. I'm grateful for you.
 Well, you have to say that now. No, I don't have to say that now. I have great boundaries.
 Oh, you do. That's right.
 No, but I think about that verse in Proverbs as a wife of noble character who can find
 she's worth far more than rubies.
 And I just think about like all the things I want on the wife that I never thought existed
 because I didn't see anybody in the landscape that I lived.
 There was nobody like you.
 And I just think it's funny that God had me fly to the other side of the world literally
 in order to meet you.
 And here you were like somebody said to me, Alan, you've married in the spiritual equivalent
 of money. You don't have people like, you know, marrying the money in their life
 changed because they're now married into like old money or something like that.
 And they have access to family funds. Well, that's what it's like marrying you.
 You know, you're just so in love with Jesus and so robust and so I had journeyed
 through so much stuff that just made you this incredible diamond of a woman.
 And I love that I get to be married to you. And I love that you chose me.
 I love that we have three beautiful children.
 When we got to practice having three brilliant children.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Yes, yes we did.
 I'll leave it at that.
 (laughing)
 I see your cheeky grin over there, Mr. Jones.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm doing my best to keep this PG-13.
  </li><li>Yeah, keep it PG-13 for a certain thing.
 Thanks baby, that's really sweet.
  </li><li>That's totally true.
 I just honestly, you know, I look around and of course,
 you know, it's not hard to look,
 it's not hard to find evidence of horrible marriages
 in the world around.
  </li><li>No, it is.
  </li><li>And I'm just so thankful, you know,
 we were talking to a friend last night and she was asking,
 like, how do you guys navigate disagreements?
 And I'm like, well, we've had 10 years of practice at it.
 But as I was answering that,
 I was thinking about how gracious you are
 to see past my, like you know me,
 and you know certain parts of me way better
 than I know myself.
 As in, the timeline of me understanding
 what's going on with me may take me longer to figure out
 than it takes you to figure out.
 And so I've noticed how patient you are
 and how skilled you are at bypassing some of my dysfunction
 and loving me through that.
 And I just think that's really, really precious.
  </li><li>Oh, thanks, Dan.
  </li><li>You're so welcome.
 Are you kidding me?
 Yeah, it's amazing.
 Well, I'm, I, yeah.
 I mean, I'm, I'm thankful to God for you for so many reasons.
 I always think back to that list that I made with him that day on the beach, you
 know, when the Lord said,
 Oh, you have a Greek God.
 Yeah.
 That one.
 Yeah.
 When the Lord said the man that I have for you will, you know, pursue you and he
 will wear you with kindness and he gave me this list.
 And I remember reading this list and thinking this man does not exist.
 Like, and if he does, he's married, like, how could somebody, this
 awesome exist. And then what do you know? I met you like a week later and you did exist.
 And you do exist right there. But yeah, I love it that we get to do life together and just,
 I get to do life with my best friend. I mean, that's pretty fantastic.
 It's very fantastic. You know what else I love? What?
 What I'm so grateful for. I'm grateful for the potential
 for life to change because of the goodness of God.
 Like I love looking at circumstances and situations and then the natural looks pretty definitive.
 But because we're in a relationship with Jesus, we have access to supernatural resources we may
 not be aware of. It's the but God. I beg your pardon? It's the but God. Oh, yes. This thing happened,
 but God did not. Right. And we need to find a better way of saying that. But you're absolutely
 right, it is. And just, you know, watching God be creative and do miracles. And that's
 just a phenomenal thing.
 It is fantastic.
 Well, let's, let's wrap it up there. I'm sure that there's other things that we can,
 we could probably go on at dozium. I mean, I could talk about what foods I'm thankful for, but
 then it will just make me hungry.
 I could talk about what Apple products I'm most thankful for.
 All of the above. Well, listen, if you're an American, have an incredible Thanksgiving.
 Happy Thanksgiving and if you're not American have an amazing last week of
 November and prizes being thankful anyway and you could just grab a turkey and
 have it anyway and just make your own holiday. That's right or not.
