<p> I live in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Welcome to episode 205 of Keeping Up With The Joneses.
 AJ Jones, how the heck are you?<br/>
 I'm good.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 Could you put your phone down because it feels like you're
 playing a video game while trying to have a podcast?
 I'm looking at our notes.<br/>
 You know what?<br/>
 I repent.<br/>
 You should repent.<br/>
 Why?<br/>
 Why might I be suspicious that you're playing a video game?
 Listen, you are more addicted to that video game
 than I am.<br/>
 And whose fault might that be?<br/>
 Well, it might be mine because I introduced you to it.
 Yes, the game is called bricks and balls.
 You like aim a laser and then it shoots all these balls and you just watch it and you just see how many you get to destroy it once.
 I'm pretty sure it's a spyware app from a foreign national country embedded in a really bad app.
 It's a terrible app from any angle.<br/>
 It is terrible, but it's highly addictive.
 So you mean you think it's like programming us for something?
 I don't know.<br/>
 It's probably listen to our conversations and send it to Facebook and Google and China.
 I don't know what it's doing, but you know what?
 I'm going to keep.<br/>
 Awesome.<br/>
 Because it's awesome.<br/>
 So those of you who are brave enough, I'll put a link in the show notes for it.
 But anyway, this week we're continuing our back to the basic series.
 Yes, we are.<br/>
 Our back to the basic series is age and I sat down and distilled what we think are the 10 most important things for the Christian life.
 And we put them into series.<br/>
 And this episode is all about the father heart of God.
 But before we get to that, let's talk about our week.
 Okay.<br/>
 You taught, didn't you, on year two?<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 I got to teach them brain science.<br/>
 So what's that about?<br/>
 Uh, I get to wear a white lab.<br/>
 Go actually, I have a white lab coat and I've never worn it.
 I should totally wear it.<br/>
 It's actually kind of creepy.<br/>
 The one time I get to attend, I'm a doctor.
 Right.<br/>
 I get to use words like your basal ganglia, empty or single,
 it gyrus prefrontal cortex, limbic system and temporal lobes.
 Wow.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 I'm so turned on right now.<br/>
 Well, at least my brain is.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 No, we're talking all about how God made the brain, how our brain works with our relationships
 and our emotions.<br/>
 And I love all that stuff.<br/>
 I, I, I really love it.<br/>
 Yeah, it's super interesting, isn't it?
 And there's a ton of great videos.<br/>
 If you would like to watch the videos that I use while teaching, not the videos of me
 teaching, if you go to <a href="mailto:ellen@ag.com">ellen@ag.com</a>/brain, you can watch some of the videos I include
 in my teaching.<br/>
 But anyway, that was a lot of fun.<br/>
 And then I got to be with second years all this week.
 I got to teach on historical and literary context
 in our Bible study, which sounds dry and dull,
 but is fasting, I love it.<br/>
 I love all these things.
</p><ul>
  <li>It's really fun, isn't it?
  </li><li>Yeah, whenever you infuse the Holy Spirit into topics,
 they suddenly become interesting.
  </li><li>I totally agree.
 I think normally I teach the historical
 and the literary context, or I have the last,
 maybe two years or something.
  </li><li>Well, I was happy to do it this time.
 I'm sure you did an excellent job.
  </li><li>Thank you, baby.
  </li><li>Yes.
 We also have friends that have come to stay.
 They arrived on Tuesday.
  </li><li>Wait, the way you said that sounds like,
 we also have friends this week.
  </li><li>We do, I promise you we have friends.
 No, we have friends that came to stay.
  </li><li>Yes, our dear friends, Gary and Sarah Morgan,
 all the way from Melbourne, Australia, landed on Tuesday.
 And God bless them, basically,
 they've been looking after us.
  </li><li>They really have.
  </li><li>They have two little ones and basically arrived
 into one of the busiest weeks that we have this year.
 And so they've been like making all the food,
 managing all the kids, doing the laundry,
 cleaning the house.
 I'm just like, I feel horrible that you're doing all this.
  </li><li>We are terrible hosts, but wonderful family.
 So we appreciate them greatly.
 I don't think we would have got through this week
 without their help, but lovely to have them.
  </li><li>Very true.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Wednesday we got to have a birthday party
 for our little boy who is now six.
 Are you kidding me?
  </li><li>I can't even believe it.
 Yeah, he turned six on Thursday,
 but because we were gonna be in a training course all day,
 Thursday, we had his birthday party on Wednesday
 at a jumping place.
 So he was well and truly ready for bed
 by the time he got off.
  </li><li>I was so happy.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was really sweet.
  </li><li>A little boy in his class,
 bought my national predators hat.
 For those of you like me who don't know
 who or what the national predators are,
 I think it's our NFL, n-h-l, n-h-l,
 are they hockey?
  </li><li>Any
 Yeah, so it's like ice hockey team.
 Yes, MJ is not in the least bit athletic or sportsy, but because it was his friend who gave him this hat.
 He has not taken that hat off the whole time.
 Seriously, he's had it on every single day.
 So we probably need to take him to a game.
 You know what?
 He would love that.
 I'd actually really love it.
 I quite like hockey.
 Well, at least I understand it.
 I understand it much better than football and football.
 I'm like, what's the first day on the second?
 I don't know.
 But hockey makes sense to me.
 Basically, it's just a puck.
 They put it around the ice and then they punch each other.
 It's perfect.
 All right.
 Stay tuned for MJ's first ice hockey fight.
 It'll be awesome.
 Yeah.
 Thursday, we started a training course.
 Well, we continued a training course that we've been doing.
 We have a wonderful organization here in Nashville called Sage Hill.
 They do a bunch of amazing work.
 They're a group of doctors and counselors and therapists.
 And they have a number of different outreaches to our community.
 They have the Center for Professional Excellence, which is an addiction rehab treatment center.
 They have state-wide counseling.
 They run different group therapies.
 They also run this incredible training program that we're doing.
 It's a year-long training program for weekends a year, and this is the second weekend of
 us being there, this bunch of our leaders from our church are going through it.
 And it's half lectures with just amazing content, and then half experiential group work where
 you're processing everything you're learning in the lectures and a bunch of other homework
 that you have to do in real time in a coed group with leaders leading you through it.
 Is that a good way of describing it? Yeah, that's a great way of describing it.
 I thought it was interesting that this week they're, you know, one of their main lectures with
 on brain science, which is what you had just taught. Yeah. So that was quite fun to just see
 the same information. It's like, yes, that's what we're familiar with. That's amazing, you know.
 I really enjoyed the reading that they gave us to do as well.
 They give us in between the weekend sessions, we have a bunch of homework to do and a bunch of
 books to read. I think the emotional fatigue you endure on a weekend like that is probably how
 our students feel. So it's nice to have a bit of our own medicine.
 Probably is actually.
 Did you enjoy what's been your perspective?
 It's interesting. I think my realization this week was that I'm not really sharing stories,
 or I mean, I've shared a lot of trauma with people in the past because of what we do, you know?
  </li><li>Free before living.
  </li><li>But you don't normally get feedback like on people's response to your trauma.
 And so it is really interesting when you tell a story that, I mean, I know this story.
 Yes, this is a traumatic story, but I'm pretty far removed from it at this point.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know, to have people have this visceral response and be like, I feel really angry on your behalf.
 and I feel really angry that this was done to you.
 It makes you think, oh, yeah, actually,
 that really wasn't okay, you know,
 because I'm so, you know, it was when I was little,
 so you're not really in touch with the pain of it anymore.
  </li><li>And you've worked through a bunch of the stuff.
  </li><li>Right, right. - Over the years.
  </li><li>But I don't, you know, when you preach,
 people don't come up to you afterwards and go,
 I'm really mad at your mom, or I'm really mad at so-and-so,
 you know, so it's, there's something that's weirdly
 validating, I guess, about, yeah, this was a real thing
 that was painful that did need to be worked through
 and it makes it feel like, oh, I'm glad that I worked
 that thing through, like I'm glad that it didn't get
 to eat my lunch.
  </li><li>I think the thing I love most, it's a lot of hard work.
 You know, staying engaged, staying in the room,
 you know, processing, not quitting,
 like you leave with an emotional hangover.
 But what's nice about it, as people care,
 it's nice to be cared for.
 It's nice to be on the other side, like we're not responsible for anybody in the room.
 We're not responsible for how the meeting is going.
 We're not responsible for this, that the next thing.
 We can just sit and receive and do work on us without trying to manage or help other people.
 Right.
 Yeah, it is nice to do that.
 Good to have the soil of our garden be weeded and tended to.
 Yes.
 And lots of stuff to process.
 Yes.
 Even though the material is very similar to the stuff that we move in, coming at it from
 different angle is beautiful. So yeah, two times I love that, but a really good, very expensive
 weekend emotionally.
 Good heavens, yes.
 But you had a little surprise waiting for you when we got home.
 What was waiting for you?
 Oh my gosh, it's not a little surprise.
 It's a huge surprise.
 It's not like I'm talking about a puppy.
 Yeah, we didn't get a puppy.
 A puppy.
 You got a kitty?
 No, no animals.
 I got given for my birthday a brand new Jura coffee machine.
 Now, I'm not a coffee person, but I do like really well-made, well-designed intelligent
 systems.
 Yes.
 And as far as coffee makers go, the Jura, this is a Swiss made espresso.
 The Jura is a boss.
 It is a boss.
 I remember the first time I had coffee from a Jura, it was at Baldur's house in Iceland.
 But I couldn't believe that I was having coffee this good, not at some posh coffee store.
 And he would just press a button and it would create it.
 And I was like, there's just no way.
 It can't be possible.
 So yes, I have been looking at them and just sort of like, oh, one day, one day Jesus,
 I'd like a Jura.
 In fact, a friend of mine and I were in a kitchen store, probably a month and a half
 of ago testing the jurors because they were giving out
 like little testers of them.
 And we were both like, Jesus, we want a juror.
 So I got to celebrate with her this morning at church
 because she was like, I'm so excited for you.
  </li><li>So you've been very much funniest
 uses to have a coffee.
  </li><li>I think I've had six today.
 So I should probably--
  </li><li>A perch just flew past the window for coffee.
  </li><li>Time for coffee.
  </li><li>Wait, the kids just said my name.
 You know what that means?
  </li><li>Time for coffee.
 Yeah, I mean, it does everything and the milk,
 There's like a milk container on the side
 that is refrigerated that it's so pulls in its own milk,
 it froths it, it does everything.
 It's like fully automated.
 The thing is a beast.
 It's amazing.
 And the coffee is so smooth.
 It's like, I don't need to go to creme anymore.
 I'm good.
  </li><li>Well, I'm very, very happy for you.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>And I quite like having a caffeinated wife
 and over caffeinated wife.
 Is there such a thing as caffeine like crash?
 You know how like I get sugar crashes?
  </li><li>Well, I don't think we're gonna find out
 any time soon. Sorry. Like ramped up a little bit. Very good. Yeah. All right. Our main topic
 for this week is all about the father heart of God. Yay. And this is a funny topic because a lot
 of people, it's a bit like what we've been talking about this weekend in that a lot of people don't
 think they need the revelation of the father's love because they already know it. Well, they sort
 of do that, you know, yes, God loves me. I'm good. Yeah. Next. Yeah. And it's like, no,
 we're not talking about a head knowledge that God loves you. Though I would, I would
 wager that many Christians don't even have a head knowledge of the love of God. True.
 Yes, I would wager that they have like an intellectual passing nod. Yes, it is a tenant
 of my faith that God loves me. And maybe they can find some verses to throw at that. But
 This revelation of God loving us as a father, no exaggeration to say that it completely changed
 our lives?
 Yes.
 Well, yes.
 What do you mean, yes, well, yes.
 I mean, did the revelation completely change my life?
 Yes.
 I believe I wouldn't actually be here without that revelation.
 So that would be a yes.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Completely.
 So tell me about the father, heart of God.
 You know, the message of the father heart of God is that you have a loving father in heaven who who actually does love you like he doesn't love you because he has to love you. He didn't have a choice.
 But he actually chose you and he continues to choose you even when you don't choose him back.
 You know, so I think for me when I got saved, I knew that Jesus loved me, but because I had so many issues with my own dad.
 because of all the different experiences that I had with him from violence to withdrawal,
 to when he killed himself, to for good years that I had with him before he killed himself,
 I was so confused in my heart about the role of a father that actually even just calling God a
 father felt really unsafe for me. And so for me, I arrived at the Toronto Airport Vineyard
 Christian fellowship at the time. And that was the main message that was coming out of that church
 even before the revival started was this message of the Father, Heart of God. And honestly, I hated
 the message. You know, I was good with Jesus and you know, Jesus loved kids and parties and you know,
 did miracles and things like that. And it seemed to me that the Father was distant and angry and
 just waiting for me to make a mistake. And I probably wouldn't have put things necessarily
 in those terms if he'd asked me, but I lived like God really didn't love me.
 Right. If you were being surveyed and you were saying, "Hey, what's God like?"
 you would probably default to an Old Testament view of God.
 He's really good if you're on his good side, but really bad if you're on his bad side.
 Right. But thank goodness for Jesus, because he's standing in the way between
 Father God who wants to smite me. Jesus is like the nice social worker that keeps the bad,
 abusive volatile angry person away. Kind of. Yeah. Yeah. So, and I didn't really realize that's
 how I lived, but here I am going to this church where they're nonstop talking about the father
 heart of God. And all of a sudden I am faced with the issue of either they are right or I am right,
 you know, because they're exceptionally excited about this revelation.
 exceptionally excited.
 It seems mundane to you at this point.
 Like, I know that God loves me.
 Can we get over that?
 Right.
 Move on, people.
 Move on.
 He's a father and yes, he loves me.
 Got it.
 Right.
 But of course, I didn't have it at all.
 Nope.
 And I certainly didn't live like I was loved.
 So yeah, I, you know, I spent like a year and a half hearing it every Sunday and just
 about ready to, you know, I don't know, punch somebody at church or something, you know.
 That's a good sign.
 have a revelation.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>That your reaction to the message is violence.
  </li><li>Yeah, when your reaction to the message is like,
 oh gosh, not this again, you know,
 it probably means you actually need to hear it.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Well, that's a good question.
 Let me stop you there.
 You said, you know, I didn't live like it was true.
 What are some indicators, you know,
 for people who are listening,
 who might have heard us talk about the father heart of God,
 what would be some indicators
 that you have a revelation,
 no matter how shallow or how deep of the father's love,
 And what does your life look like when you don't?
  </li><li>Well, I'll tell you for me when I didn't,
 I was constantly worried about whether I would be provided
 for.
  </li><li>In the natural?
  </li><li>In the natural.
 I was just like, you know, every bill that came in
 ensued panic.
 I believed like I was super insecure.
 I was always worried about what people might be thinking
 about me and what I needed to do to earn affection.
 Now, again, I don't think I was as aware of that
 until I stopped living like that.
 And then I was like, oh my gosh.
  </li><li>For you, it was a norm.
  </li><li>It was my norm, yeah, it was totally my norm.
 And it was like, you know, it was all cloaked
 under good Christian principles and things, you know,
 go and serve people.
  </li><li>The performance.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was all performance.
  </li><li>Rest up as religious observance.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>What about your relationship with God?
 What was that like, like your prayer life, your worship?
 Well, honestly, I didn't really talk to God a whole lot because, you know, he's angry.
 And busy.
 And busy.
 He's so busy.
 And he has people with bigger problems than I do.
 And so I should just suck it up and get on with the work of the gospel and spreading the
 good news.
 Right.
 I didn't know it was good news.
 Right.
 You've read that verse about picking up your cross and caring.
 That's right.
 So let's not be complaining about it.
 That's right.
 So I would say I live like a hamster on a wheel in many ways.
 about your expectations of God's good in your life?
 Well, you know, that eventually I would get to die and go to heaven.
 You know, that was it.
 Yeah.
 I mean, I really, I didn't have the ability to hope or dream.
 Um, that was all too scary.
 I didn't really want to have a high expectations because then they would be
 dashed onto the rocks again, you know, so which by the way, some people think
 it's Christian discipline, which is terrifying.
 That's the father discipline you with his love.
 Right.
 Where your hopes were your hopes were your hopes.
 There you go.
 Your hopes are smashed.
 He's disappeared.
 Do you?
 So what changed for you?
 It all was one fateful Sunday.
 I actually came to church that Sunday.
 And I literally came thinking, I hope it's something other
 than the father heart of God, you know,
 'cause it had been like a year and a half every Sunday.
 And there was a guest speaker and he said,
 he was gonna be speaking on healing,
 which I thought, oh, this is good.
 And he said, and I'm gonna start in Leviticus.
 And I was like, excellent.
 There's no way this ends up at the father heart of God.
 So I was in, you know, it was all in.
 I was excited and somehow this guy still managed to bring it around to
 God's fathering heart towards us.
 He loves us.
 And I was so annoyed.
 You're like, sigh.
 Yeah.
 I'm like, what are you?
 Are you joking?
 And so at the end, I don't remember what he asked people to stand up for.
 I probably would have stood up for anything, but I was really standing up
 just saying, Father, I need help.
 Like I feel so aggravated every time they talk about how loving you are.
 And surely this isn't the best response.
 It only took me a year and a half to get there, by the way.
 Wow.
 Yeah, I know.
 Right.
 I am in such a quick learner.
 And so I remember, I don't know what he prayed, but I remember what I prayed.
 And I just was like, Father, would you show me what everybody's so excited about?
 Cause clearly I'm missing whatever this is.
 So you humbled yourself.
 Yeah.
 You just said, I don't know what they have, but I'm aware that I don't have it or why I
 I would want to, but could you please help me understand it?
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And then that night I had a dream.
 And at the very end of the dream,
 I'm sitting in the father's lap in this dream
 and I'm laughing and he's laughing.
 And I woke up in my bedroom and I could hear God
 audibly laughing in my room for about 10 seconds.
 And I remember sort of inhaling air, you know,
 really quickly and going,
 you're real.
  </li><li>Now, you knew God was real,
 so what was the you're real about?
  </li><li>Like, I mean, his presence in the room was so strong
 and so tangible.
 I knew God was real.
 I just didn't know he was happy and friendly,
 'cause he's laughing, you know?
 And there was so much,
 like a tangible presence of joy in the room.
  </li><li>You're having a revelation of his nature.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 kindest person you'll ever meet.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And then the first that went through my head
 was John 14 verse six.
 I'm the way, the truth in the life.
 No man comes to the Father but through me.
 And I had this realization that, you know,
 for Jesus to be the way, there must be a destination.
 And I was thinking, oh gosh, he's the way to what?
 He's the way to who, you know?
 And he's a way to the Father,
 but I had gotten stuck along the way.
 You know, I was kind of at the place in my walk
 where I was good and I was comfortable with Jesus
 and I believed Jesus is safe and he is.
 But because fathers had been a scary thing for me,
 either because they're aggressive or they're angry
 or they leave or whatever,
 I'd never even tried to have an active relationship
 with the father.
 And so that moment of laughter and that dream
 set a new course for me.
 And over the next couple of years,
 the Lord would download a verse to me
 and we would spend days on it, like one single verse
 until my heart kind of caught it.
 And then it was like, he'd show me a new one.
 It was this season of a couple of years of him unraveling
 kind of the grave clothes of my heart
 and diving into how wonderful a father he is.
  </li><li>I think that's beautiful, babe,
 because one of the greatest gifts you've given me,
 aside from three beautiful children,
 is you were my teacher on the Father Heart Week.
  </li><li>I was. - And Toronto,
 like I came, and I'd heard the revelation
 the Father's love from Jack Frost
 and from James Jordan in Britain,
 but it didn't impact me till I heard you share it.
  </li><li>Wow.
 you taught me about it. And my story is a little different because I didn't have a father like you.
 I had a father who loved me not to say that your father didn't love you, but he did the best
 he could with what he had probably hard for you to decode that message. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But
 my father's love was shown in him working really, really hard and providing for us. And I really
 didn't have any interaction with my father growing up. He wasn't emotionally present like say father
 God is. So my understanding of a father loving you is, well, he provides for you, and of course,
 is interested in your well-being as far as academics and your physical health. But he's not interested
 in your interest because let's face-fact interests are frivolous and there's work to be done, there's
 loss to be saved. Let's just go. Let's get on with it. So I had a good question mark view of a father.
 Now, now what I know, I had a terrible, I had a very, very shallow living in the sense.
 Well, you had a functional father, didn't you?
 I had a functional father god.
 Functional father god who was available to be called on in an emergency.
 But it better be an emergency.
 Yeah, he's probably, you know, he's got a world to save and I've already been given Jesus.
 It's like I've been given a textbook, just read it and all the answers are in there.
 Right.
 You'll be good.
 Right.
 And I'm good because I've talked myself out of having any need.
 So I'm great.
 Oh good.
 Yeah.
 So I'm just plowing through and then I'm hearing this revelation of
 Wait, no, there's a God who from everlasting to everlasting has been looking for me and who loves me from everlasting to everlasting and
 Has written my name on the palms of his hand and he's besotted with me and he's interested in me and he's actually pursuing me
 And he loves me and he's kind and he's gentle
 Yeah, and he has he undoes you and
 It wasn't that the facts of all those things changed me.
 It was the experience of all those things.
 Yeah.
 So you listen to me talk on a podcast saying, yeah, God's loving and God's kind.
 I knew all that, but it was the experience of receiving that.
 Yeah.
 It makes me think of that first John four, verse 16.
 And that verse says, for we have come to know and have believed the love which God has for us.
 And it's an interesting verse because it highlights a few things.
 for one thing, the word love, there's a word agape. It's the unconditional love of God.
 So it's saying we have come to know and have believed the unconditional love of God.
 And knowing a believing happened really in two different places. You know, the knowing is something
 that happens in our heads. And often we sort of collect theology in our heads long before we actually
 let it get to our hearts, don't we? We have like, you know, this reservoir full of all the different
 versus that we can throw out that we know,
 but we know it in our heads.
 We don't actually believe it in our hearts.
  </li><li>And if we don't believe it in our hearts,
 we don't live out of it as a truth.
  </li><li>That's right.
 So you only actually know that you believe something
 in your heart is when you're living like it's true.
  </li><li>It's not wrong to know that Paris is the capital
 of France, that's factually correct.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But it doesn't really have any bearing on your life.
 Like knowing that might help you in a pub quiz,
 as good as true or false.
 Knowing that Paris is a capital of France
 and spending two years of your life living in Paris.
 Right.
 Two completely different things.
 In the Christian world,
 we confuse biblical fact with biblical knowledge.
 I think Bill Johnson said it best,
 Bible study without Bible experience is pointless.
 Yeah.
 It's leading us to someone, but to something.
 That's interesting.
 I like that analogy, babe, about Paris,
 because I think I remember thinking about Paris
 before I ever went there and I was like,
 oh yeah, Eiffel Tower, the CN,
 you could mention different things.
 I think the Arc de Gefriam-Fazare, that kind of stuff.
 But I know I'm probably butchering all of the enunciations,
 but just work with me.
  </li><li>I'm one of my best favorite.
 I didn't correct you at all.
  </li><li>You're twitching over there.
 I see you twitching.
  </li><li>I do, please charge.
  </li><li>But after going there,
 I know what it smells like to be there
 and what the air feels like to be there.
  </li><li>I have a son cast of shadows.
  </li><li>Yeah, like it's just totally different.
 Once you've actually experienced it,
 you have a much better understanding.
  </li><li>What do you do if you're listening to this
 and you're like, I'm really glad that you have
 a revelation of the Father's love.
 How do I get a revelation of the Father's love?
 Like, where would you suggest people start
 accessing a revelation of the Father's love?
  </li><li>It's a funny question, isn't it?
 Well, for me, because I wrote a book to help people get there.
 You know, so
 It's a slight problem that our book is currently non-stock, but aside from the book.
 Aside from the book.
 Yeah.
 Once it's going to be back in stock soon.
 This is the worst timing for podcast episode ever.
 We'll get to that part in a second.
 Oh, dear.
 Just like right now, could we pray for people right now to have a revelation of
 Father's love?
 Are there things that we'd encourage people to do?
 What I encourage you to do.
 I think I would encourage you to soak,
 like to just spend some time in the father's presence
 and invite him to come and encounter you,
 to talk to you.
 And we did an episode on soaking, didn't we?
  </li><li>We must have done.
 We also wrote an article on soaking.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I think it's at allenonagio.com/soaking.
 It's kind of like a how to,
 but yeah, you're right.
 I'm sure we did a podcast episode
 Let me look it up and see if I can find it.
 Maybe you can just put it in the notes at the end.
 How about that?
 Yeah.
 I'm sure we have I'll put a link to it in the show notes.
 I remember vaguely talking about it perhaps a number of years ago, but
 but we'll be able to tag that in.
 So I think the best thing you could do is slow down and like God
 start to talk to you about stuff, have a conversation.
 And if you've maybe had some significant wounds from from a father and authority figure and you're
 aware of maybe some fear with even trying to go there, I think probably the best thing is to just
 admit that like just be like, Father, I want to know you, but I'm scared. I really don't have a grid
 for what this looks like. And you know, how to even go there. Because the thing is, is Jesus
 came to restore us to the father. That's why he came.
 Pretty loves to do.
 So, and Jesus says at the end of John 17 and verse 26, I think it is that he says,
 "Father, I have made you known and I will continue to make you known." And so that's
 Jesus' mission is to actually introduce you to the father. So you can have a
 conversation with Jesus and say, "Jesus, I want to know the father. What would you
 introduce me to the father. And you can trust Jesus, you know that. But you can put your hand in his
 and ask him to introduce you to the father because the father is waiting to lavish his love upon you.
 And for you to actually be able to live out of the place of knowing you are his. It's just completely
 different. Should we pray? Yeah. Father, thank you that you are so wonderful and tender and
 your kind and your loving and your patient, your steadfast, your faithful, your
 for us, you're not against us. You sent Jesus to rescue us so that we could be
 with you. I thank you that you've longed for all
 eternity to be a father and to have sons and daughters and I thank you that we
 get to be that. And Lord, if there's people listening who don't have a
 revelation of your love as a father, Lord, I thank you that it's your number one
 priority to do that for them. And I thank you that the Holy Spirit sent as a down payment
 of this glorious inheritance that we'll have. When we get to be with you and see you face
 to face, the Holy Spirit is so good at revealing your fathering nature to us. And maybe a great
 place to start would be to forgive our earthly fathers for any way that they have more than
 image of what a father is.
 Yeah, or misrepresent what the father's like.
 So maybe just do that, just, you know, just repeat after me.
 Father, I repent for any judgments I made against my father
 for any way that my earthly father disappointed me
 or let me down or hurt me.
 And I give my earthly father a free gift of forgiveness.
 And I ask that you would break any judgments I may have made in my heart that may be keeping
 your love away.
 And just is even simple prayers like that are amazing at taking down walls that keep
 the love and the affection of the Father.
 And and Father I asked just even as you gave A.G. a dream I asked that you'd begin to speak
 to us.
 Those of us who are listening to this podcast right now in amazing new ways that you would
 people and resources and opportunities in our heart to get to know you and understand
 you as our Heavenly Father in new ways.
 And in Jesus' name, we ask this, I thank you that Jesus came to reveal you.
 And so we know that he loves to answer prayers like this.
 Amen.
 Amen.
 Well, I hope that was helpful as we kind of kicked around the idea of the Father Heart
 God. This is the part where we wrap up and this is the part where we should be
 organized enough to talk about picking a copy of A.J.'s book called Finding Father,
 which would be really really helpful in introducing to the Father Heart of God
 as a 12-week study guide. But as you heard earlier, it's out of stock. We are
 working on getting more copies of it in and you should be able to order them in
 a couple of weeks. But we haven't managed to do that. This would also be a great
 time for us to talk about the video course that we're busy preparing for you
 all about the father's heart, but it's not finished either. So yes, we do love you,
 but no, we're not very organized this particular season of our life. So here's
 what you can do. You can today purchase a copy of Finding Father for your iPhone
 or your iPad or your Kindle. If you visit allen and ag.com/findingfather
 all one word, and if you scroll to the bottom of a page, there's a link to both
 the iBookstore version of Finding Father and the Kindle version of Finding
 Father and that will actually get you the material and the resources. It's
 exactly the same as the paperback copy but it's electronic instead of paper.
 And if you want to be among one of the first people to know about the Finding
 Father video course and when it's available, to do this just visit
 allenanagio.com/video. If you give us your email address you'll be among the
 first to know when the course is ready. And if you're not already following us on Instagram,
 I'd encourage you to do that. We're at Allen and AJ and as soon as the paperback versions
 of the book are in stock, you will be among the first people to know. We'll also mention
 on the podcast if you're listening to that as well.
