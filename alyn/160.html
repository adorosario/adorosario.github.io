<p> I live in a days but got for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is a j Jones.
 Yes, sir. Welcome back from sunny California.
 Thank you so much.<br/>
 Tell me all about it.<br/>
 Um, it was very hot.<br/>
 Wait, you've forgotten the bit.<br/>
 What are you welcoming up at 4 30 am in the morning and like a giant of a man.
 I drove you to the airport instead of making you get an Uber.
 Yes, you did.<br/>
 But in my mind, that's what a spouse does.
 I'd never ask you to get a new bird in the morning, but that's okay.
 No, yes.<br/>
 No, no, two.<br/>
 Filed away for future early airport runs.
 So California is hot.<br/>
 How is it a hot different from Tennessee hot?
 It's like a dry heat, but it was hot.<br/>
 I mean, it was like 106 kind of hot.<br/>
 Good Lord.<br/>
 So yeah, I was really bummed because I posted to Instagram stories when it was at 104, 103.
 and I should have posted it like half an hour earlier when I was on
 six, but I didn't think about it.<br/>
 And then I was like, oh, it's gone down.
 It doesn't look as impressive.
</p><ul>
  <li>But according to your talking heads of Instagram,
 I honestly don't understand why people do that,
 but you seemed to have jumped into it,
 made it your new life manifesto.
 According to that, which I did watch
 because it was one of the only ways I could connect
 with you because of the time zone.
  </li><li>Oh, thanks, baby.
  </li><li>You said that it was great for hair.
  </li><li>It was great for hair.
 So if, for example, in Tennessee, if you
 fly straight in my hair, because it's quite humid,
 it's questionable whether it will still be straight
 when I get home, and certainly it's gonna be a heck
 of a lot more puffy because my hair actually has
 curled to it.
  </li><li>When you say quite humid, do you mean,
 are you kidding me, this humidity is killing me human?
  </li><li>Yeah, like you can cut it and drink it kind of humid.
  </li><li>Bleh.
  </li><li>But there, it's super dry.
 So whatever your hair looked like in the morning,
 that's what it looks like when you get home,
 which I thought, well, this is brilliant.
  </li><li>It's a bonus, I guess.
 Right, so from now on when I see people on Instagram
 with great hair from California,
 I'm gonna attribute some of it to the weather.
 Yep, that's my new theory.
  </li><li>So you were in California for a whole week,
 left Monday, got back Saturday, not whole week.
  </li><li>Well, six days, yep.
 Tell us about it, what were you doing there?
  </li><li>I went out for a Bethel Hosts something
 called the School of the Profits.
 And so I went out to attend that, which was super fun.
  </li><li>It must have been nice to be at a conference
 that you had no responsibility for.
  </li><li>Yeah, I can't actually, I was trying to think of a time
 when that that's been the case
 when we haven't either been ministering there
 or emceeing or responsible in some way.
  </li><li>Yeah, we're hosting it right now.
  </li><li>Or hosting it.
 And I think perhaps it's been about 15 years.
  </li><li>Good Lord.
  </li><li>Yeah, so that to me was like, oh gosh, we need to,
 maybe to make sure that doesn't happen again.
 I mean, it was so great to just go and attend
 and have no responsibility and just receive and process
 with the Lord and meet people
 and not have to be thinking about where I need to be next.
  </li><li>And I would imagine that there's a certain level
 of appreciation in your heart
 that might not be present in a normal conference score
 because you know how hard it is to run events.
 So you would notice all the little details
 they would do to make life easier.
  </li><li>Yeah, and they're brilliant at it.
 I mean, Bethel has this thing down.
 They're brilliant at running conferences.
 everything from registration to how they did ministry time,
 all that kind of stuff, just like amazing, really, really good.
 Which means while you were away, I was,
 what's that all by myself, the wannabe?
 Wait, wait, let me get my violin.
 It's not selling Dion, is it?
 Who sings that?
 I don't know, actually.
 But-- Hey, Siri, who sings all by myself?
<strong>[LAUGHING]</strong>
 Myself is by naph.
 Nope.
 Nope, that's not it.
 Anyway, I was a.
  </li><li>She would let you down, baby.
 Just a minute, she let you down.
  </li><li>Never, never.
 Anyway, I was all by myself.
  </li><li>You were.
  </li><li>Which was weird because California's
 two hours behind Tennessee.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>She doesn't sound like much, but it is much when it's like.
  </li><li>Well, when I go to bed at 11 p.m.
 you were in a conference at 9 p.m.
  </li><li>Yeah, so we didn't get to chat very much.
  </li><li>When I got up at 7 a.m. with the kids, it's 5 a.m. for you.
 So.
  </li><li>Yeah, but I was awake, but yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, look at you, night owl.
  </li><li>Or morning, something.
 I just, I didn't sleep that great.
 I, I decided this time not to bring my pillow.
 Cause I'm like, I'm not a wuss.
 I never used to travel with a pillow.
 It's only the last couple of years I've traveled with my pillow.
 Dude, I should have brought my pillow.
 Did you just do it me?
 I just do did you.
 I, I could not make any of the, of the four pillows on that bed.
 Into a shape that was conducive for sleeping.
 That's because I bought you the best pillows in the market.
 That's true.
 Bamboo pillow.
 We got to love the bamboo pillow.
 Yep.
 Anyway, I had a great time with the kids.
 Good.
 in part because I just made a meal plan.
  </li><li>Yes, and I bought you everything for your meal plan
 ahead of time and helped.
  </li><li>Wait a steal my glory.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead, yes, you made a meal fun.
  </li><li>I'll have you know it was the kids first day of school
 that you weren't home for.
  </li><li>I know.
  </li><li>And I got them dressed and met their parents
 and have successfully avoided the PTA people.
  </li><li>Wait, you met their parents?
 They have new parents.
 I didn't know this.
  </li><li>Something I need to tell you.
  </li><li>Oh dear.
 It's just easier that way. But anyway, I'm glad you had a great time. I'm glad to have you back. Thank you. Um, a lot of stuff happened while you're away.
 Like we got a snake. We did.
 You I'm like in the middle of a session on Friday and then you just send me a picture of a snake and said this is in our tree and I, I almost screamed in the meeting.
 I was like, get it out. Yeah, I posted this picture to Instagram and just said, okay, Internet people.
 Like, is this snake okay?
 At first, it alarms me that there's an okay category.
 I don't know how you got that close to it.
 I, I, I'm terrified.
 Well, I just walked up to it and put my camera near it.
 It's not that close.
 Well, it looks pretty close.
 I am getting anywhere near it.
 I like kept like four meters or five meters away from it.
 Kate Kate was saying, "Hey, Alan, maybe you should back up."
 But it didn't look like a fast, but I know nothing about snakes.
 So anyway, I put it up on Instagram.
 Does he don't know anything about snakes, but it didn't look very fast moving snake.
 Well, I tell you what, when I went behind it, it turned its head to me and stuck it.
 It's tongue doing that little thing.
 And I was like, okay, good feeling.
 Okay, I think I'll leave now.
 So anyway, I put it on Instagram, said, is this snake okay or do I need to burn the house down and
 start from scratch? Right.
 And very quickly people said it's fine. It's just it's a what's called a black rat snake.
 I thought they said it was called a black king snake.
 Well, there's all these generic terms to describe the same snake, basically.
 And so basically it's a pretty harmless snake.
 It's good because it keeps the area free of other pests like mice and rodents.
 But never having seen a snake up close.
 It freaked me out.
 Apparently also if it gets agitated, it will shake its tail and mimic sounding like a rattlesnake,
 though it's not.
 So it's not venomous to humans.
 It's a constrictor, so it crushes its prey and then swallows it whole.
 but only needs to eat i think once every two weeks so might stay in the tree for like two weeks because it's still there hasn't moved in three days i went out to get basil and i was terrified even though it was in a tree five meters away i.
 Was still there oh it's still there is just hanging out it wasn't me the found it was our next door neighbor deer drug now imagine.
 Imagine this okay did was coming over to get some tomatoes or weed your garden or what what is doing something awesome anyway you've roped her in blood.
 I didn't broke her into it.
 Anyway did was coming over yeah and walking the way she always does and she said the snake is I level and just walked into the site and it's like.
 I backed up and went around the other side of the house yeah so.
 So I don't need to call us like a snake removal.
 I wouldn't mind if we did.
 Well, I mean, we can if you want.
 I saw like a really cool snake trap we can buy.
 OK, is it for trees?
 Oh, no.
 Hmm.
 Maybe I'll turn the hose on it and see if I can.
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
 No, no, no, three.
 Brit said he'd come up and just grab a and eat it.
 What?
 I don't know.
 There's some strange people in Tennessee.
 I'm not going to lie.
 Okay.
 But anyway, that was the adventure for this week.
 Okay.
 I don't want to keep it.
 Although we have named it now.
 Yeah.
 Another reason I don't go outside in nature.
 Right.
 No snakes in here.
 I know now I'm not enjoying my garden anymore because I'm terrified to go outside.
 Well, here's the thing we can get in the house.
 What?
 Yeah.
 That's what I read about today.
 Okay.
 They can climb walls as well as they can climb trees.
 you should not tell me that yet sleep well baby okay um but how do they get in the house
 through open windows no how i can tell you just freak out okay you better tell me now
 because now i'm freaked out already they watch you type in the pin number wow yeah very clever
 yeah all right well moving on from snakes our topic this week is all about endurance
 Ooh, that sounds exciting.
 Because here's the thing to achieve anything in life.
 You're going to need endurance.
 Yeah, anything good.
 Well, just anything.
 Well, some people think it's an achievement if they've just scoop some
 ice cream and sound the couch, you know, and you might think that's, you know,
 pretty impressive.
 I didn't do it.
 I mean, I had to get out of the freezer.
 It was rock solid.
 I persevere anyway.
 Well, there is that.
 Yeah.
 You just all about robbing my glory tonight.
 Sorry.
 Go ahead.
 Yes.
 Endurance.
 Yeah.
 Well, endurance is basically not giving up even when all the circumstances are conspiring against you to do so.
 Right.
 I mean, think about, think about the times where you've had to endure.
 Yes.
 Think about marriage, for example.
 Dude, surely there have been times where you're like,
 where I've thought about snuffing in your sleep, that sort of thing.
 I'll never confess.
 I remember one time we had a huge fight and I came back and apologized and I said, babe, I'm so sorry.
 Like, that wasn't great.
 And so you said, I forgive you.
 And then later that night was we're climbing a bed.
 You were like, you know, babe, it's a good job.
 You apologize.
 And I was like, well, why is that?
 You were like, well, I was seriously considering peeing in one of your shoes.
 I was.
 You were that mad.
 I was so bad.
 I was suddenly trying to figure out to ruin something of yours.
 I was so mad.
 I was like, I get peeing shoes.
 I literally started to shoes for a while.
 Just to sort of spiritual giants right here and keeping up with.
 But I didn't.
 I didn't pee in them.
 So that's the important part of that story.
 What are the things then that help you manufacture the things needed for endurance?
 I mean, what do you go to things to help you endure?
 Well, it depends on what the thing is that I'm enduring, I suppose, but sometimes if it's a season, then usually it's
 hanging on to whatever God has said about the outcome of the season.
 'cause if you can hang onto prophetic words
 that say something different
 than what you're experiencing right now,
 then you can fight a war with them.
 So I would say that,
 and I would say just being able to hear the voice of the Lord
 in the midst of when you're enduring something,
 if you can hear his comforting voice,
 and maybe that voice isn't saying,
 "It's changing tomorrow,"
 but it's saying, "Hey, I'm with you."
 Then I think you can endure just about anything.
  </li><li>What about that season where you got all those prophetic
 words about husband that was coming. Yeah. Talk about that.
 Well, I didn't use those words to fight. Well, I mean, it was really tough.
 It was a really, really difficult season. And I don't know how many times I've
 been a bridesmaid somewhere around 20 times. I mean, in my life, not just in that
 season, right? But I've been a bridesmaid a lot. And but in that season, it seemed
 like everybody was getting married and having kids. And I was the divorce chick
 that got left, you know, and it was hard.
 It was just really hard.
 But I did know that I was built for something and I did know life didn't end this way, you
 know.
 And where did you get that from?
 Just the things that Lord had told you or just an internal knowing or taught me about
 that.
 I'm trying to think.
 have some words. You know, remember Isabelle, Alan, and this, this was, I'm trying to think
 how long after my first husband left, but she said, she didn't know me at all at this
 point. And she said, you know, I see you in this tunnel and it feels very dark, but there
 is a light at the end of the tunnel. And the Lord still has promise over you. And I just
 I thought, okay, you know, let's get to know.
 But I knew I knew I was called to ministry
 and I knew I was called to preach it in that season.
 I wasn't doing any of that.
 And it looked like my whole life was heading
 in the absolute opposite direction
 of anything I planned or wanted.
 But God always gets the last word in the end, doesn't he?
  </li><li>He does.
  </li><li>So I think, I mean, there was definitely days
 where I didn't fight as well.
 And you know, and there was days where I had more hope.
 But I think I also had a lot of great relationship around me to help me stay hopeful on the days when I was pretty low.
 So yeah, it is amazing.
 Hope really is the fuel for endurance.
 Yeah.
 You have vision gives pain a purpose.
 Yeah.
 And so if you can have some sort of vision or some sort of hope or some sort of larger context for what's going on.
 And I think as speaking personally, as I've journeyed with the Lord, because of my history with the Lord, I've realized.
 that being in relationship with Jesus gives you options that aren't available to normal people.
 I think of the times that we've been in financial crisis.
 Now what I've learned from being in financial crisis, where the Lord just invaded in the midst
 of it and quite dramatically rescued us and saved us, I have now got this area of my heart
 where there's an expectation for God to do something beyond what I could ask or imagine.
 And I would never have got that had I not learned to endure in crisis and then see God survive.
 You know, if God's constantly meeting you before crisis happens, you never strengthen your endurance muscle.
 Yeah. I think that I think that's right, babe.
 I think it's the people that have experienced breakthrough because breakthrough was necessary
 or the ones that have faith for breakthrough for others too.
 So I remember even a silly example.
 I remember last summer when we were moving house and I don't want to over stretch this
 example because let's face facts. We had a team of people helping us move.
 That's great, too. But nevertheless, there were plenty of weekends or evenings where
 we were just packing up boxes and just loading up boxes in the minivan and driving over to our
 storage facility. I'm hauling in boxes in the 80% humidity we were talking about earlier.
 And the Tennessee summer heat, and it just wasn't fun, especially when it was carting boxes that
 I'd already moved three times earlier and we'd never even opened that. I'm like, why are we keeping?
 We don't even know what's in these boxes. But in that moment, at the back of my head,
 I knew that the pain I was experiencing had a purpose and the purpose was a new house.
 Not even that. I remember at one point moving and the Lord said, "How you enjoying your day off?"
 I'm like, "Well, I'm trying not to grumble, but here I am moving all these boxes."
 And the Lord was like, "Let me ask you a question." And I was like, "Uh-huh."
 He's like, would you move these boxes for X thousand dollars?
 Like it was, you know, it was basically the equity we'd built in our house.
 And I was like, why yes, yes, I can.
 And having like a sense of a bigger picture of what I was doing made the fact
 that I was choosing to give my day off to being all hot, sweaty and doing
 manual labor much easier.
 Yeah.
 Perspective helps with endurance, doesn't it?
 So does money.
 Yeah.
 I mean, that's one of the reasons humans get paid a salary.
 Right.
 Like we endure things about our jobs we don't like and return for money we do like.
 Yeah.
 So yeah, I mean, that's one of the things, finding hope and then thinking of life in
 seasons, talk about what it's like because a lot of our friends are having babies
 who are about to have babies to talk about the endurance needed for the first 10 or
 11 weeks of having a baby.
 Yeah, it's always funny when you talk to pregnant moms, especially obviously
 moms that have not had a baby at, you know, it's their first baby.
 And you don't want to be the bummer.
 Like you don't want to be like, hey, here's what you need to know.
 But I remember thinking with, you know, all three of the kids, the same sort of thing,
 but the first time, like the first time you're having a baby, you're like,
 hoping you're right.
 And then the second and third time, I was like, yeah, I can do this.
 Um, it's just like, wow.
 Okay.
 The first eight weeks are the hardest, you know, and yep, it's getting up every three
 hours and you know, it's not getting a whole lot of sleep and sleeping when the baby's asleep and
 kind of not feeling like your best self and at times feeling like, "Oh wow, I'm so emotional,
 I have all these hormones and this and that." And you just know this is a season and it's going to end.
 Well, you have to tell yourself that. Yes. Otherwise you think, "What has just happened to me?"
 Why did I do this? And then really by about, you know, 12 weeks, you're starting to feel like
 yourself again and you're back to being a human being. I would sort of joke like as
 soon as I was getting five or six hours, I was like, I can take on the world. You know,
 we're prior to baby five or six hours was a diminished sleeping scenario at five or six
 hours after having a newborn. You're just like, you feel like you could, you know, I
 don't know, go run the American Ninja Warrior course, stand aside people. So yeah. So it
 It does take endurance, I think, obviously, to have kids all the way through.
 That's the thing.
 We haven't hit teenage years yet.
 People who have teenagers are like, "Ha ha ha, you don't know anything about endurance."
 It's so true.
 Come back and record a podcast in like 10 years.
 Oh gosh.
 We heard so many stories this week at the conference, just, you know, Chris sharing stories and
 different people sharing stories.
 And I was just like, "Lord, alright, make me ready.
 Give me ears to hear them.
 Help me not to shut them down."
 all the things that they're telling us, just to make us better parents as we're walking through
 the process. So yeah, I definitely know that we're not quite there yet.
 What about work? Yeah.
 Because we've all had seasons of working with people, or worse working for people that you don't like.
 And I've just learned that there's things you learn about yourself
 enduring that and pressing through. And it's funny with the Lord, because there are things you
 learn past your comfort zone that you can't learn in any other season of your life.
 Yeah. And so, you know, we're crazy Christians really. We're like, "Oh God,
 give me like, make me more Christ-like." And we think it's going to be like fairy dust.
 Right. And we're going to wait. And about no, he puts you in situations where you are required
 to be more Christ-like. Right. And he grinds off the heart edges and all that.
 Yeah. He gives you annoying co-worker or you know, whatever it is, that just kind of grinds you down
 and you're like, "Okay, no, no, this is what I asked for."
 It's funny though, the Holy Spirit is called the Comforter.
 He's called that for a reason because we're going to face seasons of life that are uncomfortable
 and he's the antidote.
 Yeah, they require comfort. I think there's all kinds of seasons of our lives that require endurance.
 And whether you're waiting for the thing that you hoped for, whether that's a spouse or a kid
 or the job or whatever the thing is that feels like it's the dream that's never getting here.
 Endurance to stay in the game and continue to believe God and keep letting God refine you
 until such a time as the hope arrives or the thing that you hoped for arrives.
 That's endurance. That's the real deal kind of stuff.
 Or where you're in a season where you have less than what you need.
 I think anytime you're walking in the prophetic learning
 to trust the prophetic words that you've got,
 like you said earlier, is endurance.
 I remember Graham Cook said something brilliant.
 He said, "When you're in a season where you need endurance,
 "the why question is the wrong question to ask.
 "Why is this happening to me?
 "Why don't I have enough money?
 "Why haven't my prophetic words come through?"
 He said, "The why question rarely gets answered
 "to the sight of eternity.
 "The better question to ask is the who question.
 Who does God want to be for me in this season that he couldn't be for me in any
 other season?
 Right.
 And that was so helpful for me when I just started asking, all right, Lord,
 who do you want to be to me in this season?
 I don't, I don't need to know the reasons of why I'm here.
 Can we just learn how, you know, who you want to be for me?
 And beginning to access that part of the father's heart was just, was, was pivotal.
 Yeah.
 I feel bad because let's face facts when I review my life, I haven't endured anything.
 I mean, of course I have them, give new examples.
 But in the face of the enormous suffering that people
 that Christians are facing all over the world,
 I haven't endured persecution.
 So I appreciate I'm coming from a very, very privileged
 position.
 But it's the only examples I have.
 I remember when the Lord had asked me to go be a teacher
 and I quit my job and I went back to teacher training school
 and I so didn't want to do it.
 I just thought, Lord, I'm,
 and I think part of the reason I didn't want to do it was
 I wasn't sure it actually heard the Lord.
 I'm like, I don't want to waste thousands of dollars and all of the year of my life doing
 something I hate doing.
 I've got no passion for this.
 I remember I must have been so anxious about it.
 I was sick the very first week of school.
 I was at home sick.
 I felt that the Lord said, "You need to decide if you've heard from me or not.
 If you have heard from me, you need to be obedient."
 I went home to be with my parents.
 I was in my parents' house and I drove out.
 There's a cemetery right next to where my parents used to live.
 I got up one Sunday morning and I took my Bible and I just cycled up the top of the hill.
 It's a cemetery on a hill, Balgate Cemetery.
 And I sat there and watched the sun come up and I just read Revelation chapter 3, seven
 times it says to him who overcomes and then God gives us promise.
 And I realized, oh, you can't overcome without endurance.
 Like here's all the promises for those who overcome.
 If this is the Lord, despite the fact I don't want to do it, I can overcome it.
 And I just, you know, that whole year was a year of overcoming right, Lord, I believe
 you've asked me to do this.
 Would you give me the resources to do it?
 Did you know God is a God who will give you endurance?
 I did know that.
 I didn't.
 Oh, I mean, I didn't, I mean, I didn't think he would abandon us in the midst of trials,
 which therefore would mean he'd have to give us endurance to be able to go through it.
 But look, you don't even need that brilliant logic.
 Romans 15 verse five says this, "May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had."
 God gives endurance and encouragement.
 I'm like, that is amazing.
 Can I get a whoop boop?
 How have I only just learned that verse?
 Right.
 I'm like, oh, God, I didn't realize that you were a source of endurance and encouragement.
 So our prayer for you guys, if you're listening to this and you're needing encouragement or you're needing, you know, some level of endurance,
 the Lord would love to provide both of those things for you. And as a prayer in Colossians chapter 1,
 it says this verse 9, "We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will,
 through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives, so that you may live a life
 worthy of the Lord, and please him in every way, bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the
 knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might,
 so that you may have great endurance and patience and giving joyful thanks to the Father,
 who's qualified you to share in the inheritance of His holy people in the Kingdom of Light.
 First, the prayer there that Paul's asking is that God would fill you with the knowledge of His will,
 back to what you were saying earlier, babe, that having a greater sense of purpose in your life
 is key to being able to endure the season that you're in. And then, recognizing that actually
 to the spirit of the Lord will give you wisdom on the standing so that we can live a life
 that pleases the Lord, which includes endurance and patience.
 And the other key we haven't even talked about is giving thanks.
 The power of thanksgiving is huge.
 When you can just stop and just say, God, even though I'm finding this part of my life
 sucky, I thank you that.
 And then just a torrent of thanksgiving will pour out of your mouth.
 Anything you can thank him for, it starts to shake it loose, doesn't it?
 I have a final thought for you about endurance.
 Tell me, hit me with it.
 Sometimes endurance isn't so much about suffering and pressing through as it is about being
 disciplined.
 And what I mean by that is it's so easy to be distracted and not get things done.
 Right.
 But part of endurance is choosing to be powerful and manage yourself well.
 Part of endurance is saying, I'm going to say no to just bingeing on Netflix and yes
 to go and do the thing they said I was going to do.
 Right.
 And that's the thing.
 I asked the season, I feel like I'm in right now is, you know, often the Holy Spirit is
 just like, Hey, come on, buddy, focus because I get distracted really, really easily.
 You know, my low boredom threshold.
 Do you?
 Oh, I hadn't noticed.
 And so I just realized now that's an area I can grow in endurance in terms of being disciplined
 enough to say no to distraction.
 So I can say yes to focus.
 Sounds good.
 But you know, I could do with right now.
 Um, a lot.
 Well, aside from some supper because we haven't eaten.
 I'm going to feed you.
 I'm going to feed you when we're done recording.
 You know what I could do with the listening question?
 Okay.
 Well, oh, well, I have to have one of those.
 Look at you.
 Go for it.
 I know I'm on top of it.
 So this is a listener question from Becky.
 And Becky says, "Can you talk about the difference between authority and influence?
 For context, I'm referring to your recent sermon at Grace Center specifically your discussion
 on to Corinthians 10 verse 13.
  </li><li>I can.
 For those of you who haven't listened,
 the last three weeks I've been doing a series
 at Grace Center, all about the fivefold ministry,
 Apostles, Prophets, Passes, Teachers, and Evangelists.
 And I was talking about Apostles,
 the verse in 2 Corinthians 10, 13 says,
 "This is Paul writing,
 'We will not boast beyond our measure,
 but within the measure of the sphere,
 which God appointed to us as a measure
 to reach even as far as you."
 Basically Paul saying,
 "Hey, I'm an apostle, but I'm not an apostle to everybody.
 I'm only an apostle to the sphere,
 this realm that God's given me authority in."
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I made a passing comment about,
 there's a world of difference between authority
 and influence.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So what I meant by that is,
 let's take a pastor or a leader at church.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>There is gonna be, most likely,
 an authority on their life placed by God.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And by authority, I don't mean it's something
 that they're forcing on people or lording over people.
 I mean, there'll be a spiritual grace upon their life
 that when they say things because of the anointing
 on their life, what they've said will take effect
 in the lives of some of the people in that church.
 So for example, they'll be preaching on Sunday,
 they'll be preaching the word,
 they'll give an instruction, something like that.
 And those words will take effect
 in the lives of some of the people in the church.
 Those people that it takes root in their lives
 are the ones who've decided that that leader has a place of authority in their life.
 Right.
 So, so for example, my sister and her family, they go to Elevation Church in North Carolina,
 Pastor Steven Furtick is the pastor there.
 So my sister and whenever I speak to my sister, Cara, she's always like, Oh, you need to listen
 this message to Pastor Steven preached.
 It was amazing.
 And clearly, Cara has given Pastor Steven authority to speak into her life.
 His words are big in her ears, so to speak.
 like she loves listening to his teaching, she wants to put into practice what she's heard,
 she recognizes I have given him a place of authority in my life.
 There are other people that will go to that church or perhaps other people that maybe
 listen that message online or other people who are following him on Twitter who will
 hear the same thing that perhaps my sister's like, "Oh my gosh, this is amazing, this is
 life changing."
 And I'll be like, "Huh, yeah, that's a good point."
 And then there's still others who will just ignore what he's saying.
 The first group, like my sister and other people, they have given Pastor Stephen authority
 in their life.
 The second group, Pastor Stephen merely has influence in their life.
 The third group, he has no voice at all.
 That's what I mean.
 We recognize that in our own life.
 We teach regularly at Grace Center, at the school, or at Ammonate.
 We see people who hear what we say and we can see that they apply in their life.
 equally we can see other people who will still listen and they'll kind of like,
 "Yeah, maybe not so much."
 And they'll pick and choose what they're going to accept.
 Right.
 There's other people who seek out our counsel.
 It's obvious that we have become an authority in their life.
 It gets important to clarify.
 They have chosen that we are an authority in their life.
 It's not like we've gone to say, "Yay, submit to us.
 We have authority."
 That's nauseating that thought.
 But there are others who are like, "Yeah, we kind of like what you're saying."
 And so in a nutshell, the difference is influence gets people to listen to you.
 Authority gets people to obey.
 Good.
 Does that help?
 I hope that helps.
 Becky, if that doesn't help, you can ask another question.
 I'll try and clarify it.
 Okay.
 All right.
 AJ Jones, take us home.
 Thanks so much for listening.

 I can't believe we've done 160 of these 160 episodes, baby.
  </li><li>So we passed by our three year anniversary.
 We didn't even realize it four episodes ago.
  </li><li>Well, to be honest, four episodes ago,
 we were, I was in Scotland, we were kind of moving.
  </li><li>Well, that's true.
  </li><li>We have forgotten, you know what, we normally do each year?
  </li><li>We do a giveaway.
  </li><li>We do a listener survey and a giveaway.
 So forgive us, we will get on that.
 We will have a listener survey and a giveaway.
 We love, we've got a whole load new listeners
 We didn't have a year ago, a couple of thousand of you.
 So we would love to hear more about you,
 where are you from, how we can make more depth better for you.
 Yeah. Okay, baby.
 We've got a very excited.
 I love those surveys. They're so amazing.
 I love them too. I, I, I, yeah, I love Poonow.
 It's one of my favorite.
 So one of the highlights of my year, I'm just a feedback junkie.
 Yeah.
 I love hearing what people are thinking.
 So we'll make that happen.
 We'll set that up and next week we'll talk about that.
 But for now, thanks so much for listening.
 We pray you have an amazing week that you have confidence and endurance
 from God to get through whatever you're going and that you'll come out the other side
 flourishing having learned a million things.
 Yeah, amen.
