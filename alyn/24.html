<p> Hey, James hello, sir. Good morning to you evening. Well, it's it's almost morning
 12 35 a.m. It<br/>
 Is morning. This is how much we love you listeners. Good morning my love
 Yes, I would like to say good morning after slept
 All right, I take it back. Let's talk about our crazy week which will explain why we're up this late during our podcast
 Crazy, crazy week.<br/>
 It's probably one of the busiest weeks I can remember.
 Yes.<br/>
 It's, I'm, there's not point any point in counting when the last time I had a day
 office, let's just move along.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 It's been amazing.<br/>
 That sounds like martyrdom.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 It's been absolutely tremendous.<br/>
 No, it's been amazing.<br/>
 We kicked off this week, teaching sexual purity week at the school.
 I love watching our students.<br/>
 Go for it.<br/>
 Stay with me as we go through what's possibly one of the most awkward weeks of teaching.
 I always start off saying, guys, there's no way we can run this.
 We're going to talk about sex.<br/>
 And I'm realizing this week may sound like your parents try to talk to you about having sex,
 which is awkward, but plus them, they stayed there.
 They did great.<br/>
 They did it.<br/>
 They did amazing.<br/>
 What else do we have this week?<br/>
 We went to the farmers market on Saturday.
 Wow.<br/>
 Way to jump from Monday straight through to Saturday.
 Well, yes, we did. When the farmers market, I try to find the farmers market.
 Why? Because Lucy Rizzo's there. Yes, and Lucy Rizzo has the most delicious food on the planet.
 She really does. It's so good. She makes this breakfast sandwich.
 The Gary Morgan will testify to when he gets to Nashville. We both both break our diets to eat
 her breakfast sandwich. Well, that's the problem though. They're so stinking good. They're amazing.
 you had one as well. I'm teaching you to walk in the light.
 I did. I had their handmade corn biscuits.
 Yeah, so good. Right.<br/>
 Smothered in her homemade pimento cheese
 with country ham<br/>
 and a boiled egg. I'm getting hungry.<br/>
 And we're not supposed to be in cheese, ham or grains.
 Yeah, I mean, the whole thing is off.<br/>
 And we're like just the only thing we're allowed to have is the egg.
 It is the most delicious thing at the farmers market.
 followed by her gluten free muffins.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And her limeate, which was absolutely delicious.
 But you found some new friends.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Franklin Juice has just gotten their juice truck up in mobile.
 So it was at the farmer's market.<br/>
 What did you have?<br/>
 I had the cashew milk and it was outstanding.
 Outstanding.<br/>
 Describe to me because I'm not talking about a difficult
 is to milk cashews because of their tiny nipples. You need tiny little fingers. I don't actually
 even know everything that's in it. Cashew honey cinnamon. I don't know. It's the goodness
 of the Lord. It's sprouted cashews. It's so good. It's got some raw honey. And then I
 don't remember anything else. Oh, that's very helpful. Thank you, darling. Yeah, I was 100%
 more than you listed.<br/>
 It was so good.<br/>
 Our kids did a fun run this week.<br/>
 That was neither fun nor a run as I seem to remember.
 It was a run though because I ran two laps with Abby and she actually ran.
 This is the first year I've actually seen her actually run.
 I posted a video this week of MJ playing football or soccer for you Americans in our
 back garden and I thought, "How is this my son?
 He's outside.<br/>
 He likes kicking a ball."<br/>
 He more than likes. He loves being outside. He loves kicking a ball. I mean, he cries when you
 bring him back inside. He is my son. And then we had our dear friend, Samaha Bebe with us.
 We did. Yes. We've talked about Samaha before, but in a nutshell, Samaha is one of the craziest
 stories ever. She was raised to Muslim in a Middle Eastern country, devout Muslim, whole family,
 Muslim. She met Jesus, gave her life to him, suffered incredible persecution because of her
 faith to Jesus, which in and of itself would be an amazing story. But then her church was bombed
 by a terrorist attack and she died, went to heaven, met Jesus. He said, "Do you want to stay
 or do you want to go back?" She said, "I want to go back." She came back to earth.
 She said an interesting thing actually when she was giving her testimony.
 She said when she was with Jesus in heaven, she saw like a, like a video tape of her life,
 you know, like just scenes flashing and whatever.
 Right.<br/>
 And, you know, she wanted to come back because her family wasn't saved yet.
 But the other thing she said is she realized in watching her life that she'd lived her whole life for her.
 And she wanted to go back and have a chance to live her life for Jesus.
 Wow.<br/>
 which I was like, wow.<br/>
 So anyway, yeah, that was.<br/>
 That was incredible.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And we'll put a link to her book.<br/>
 If you haven't read her book, play free this.
 It's incredible.<br/>
 Put a link to that in the show notes.<br/>
 The big news of this week, of course, of which we are going to be talking about
 in the podcast is that we had an incredible conference at Grey Centre.
 Yes, we did.<br/>
 Why is everything in song this evening?
 I don't know.<br/>
 It's just the joy of the Lord.<br/>
 Yes, it's overwhelming, isn't it?<br/>
 So we had our having declares conference.
 The lineup was supposed to be<br/>
 John Paul Jackson, R.T.<br/>
 Kendall and Bobby Connor.<br/>
 But poor John Paul got sick with conjunctivitis, highly infectious
 I infection couldn't leave the house.<br/>
 And I think it's back when I was two, so you couldn't leave the house.
 So sad.<br/>
 So we were, you know, praying that he would be there, but he didn't make it.
 But R.T.<br/>
 And Bobby Chris was just sick, Chris McLawning and Jesse led
 leaving worship was amazing.<br/>
 They were amazing.<br/>
 Both of them.<br/>
 Fantastic.<br/>
 And then Bob in RT came.<br/>
 RT for those of you who don't know, I'd imagine if you're from the UK, you'll know
 exactly who RT Kendall is.<br/>
 If you're from America, it's likely you may be familiar with RT, but basically he's one
 of the most amazing theologians.<br/>
 He is Oxford educated.<br/>
 He passed a church in London called Westminster Chapel for about 20 odd years.
 It's a block away from Buckingham Palace, but he just loves the word of God.
 He is going to be how old?<br/>
 80.<br/>
 It's going to be 80.<br/>
 I think so.<br/>
 Oh, R.T. for listening to this.<br/>
 I didn't age you age.<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 Um, but he's older than I am.<br/>
 And yet he's just absolutely amazing.<br/>
 Bobby, for those of you who don't know, Bobby is, is the complete redneck.
 And I mean, that in the most endearing fashion.
 It's so funny.<br/>
 He's a former Southern Baptist pastor.
 Yeah.<br/>
 He met the Holy Spirit and he's a prophet and tells the most ridiculous stories I think
 I may have ever heard in my life.<br/>
 It's probably more accurate to say he's a former like hooligan alcoholic who became
 a Baptist pastor who became a prophet because some of his stories are like, "Ah!" and then
 he'll qualify.<br/>
 Well, this is before I met Jesus.<br/>
 Yeah, like, okay.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Well, I feel slightly better about this very bizarre story.
 I was at our church a couple of years ago.
 As he was leaving the church, he stopped and said to a young man who's at our church,
 he said, "Hey, you're going to hit a curve in the road, but everything's going to be
 okay.<br/>
 Don't let it worry you."<br/>
 And then a week later, this guy who was in his early 40s had a stroke and then was
 completely okay.<br/>
 So we were like, "Oh, you were on with that one."
 Yep.<br/>
 But Ajay, tell me, RT and Bobby, top three things about Bobby when he's here.
 Top three things about Bobby. He's so funny, just amazingly funny.
 Right. He absolutely carries the joy of the Lord.
 Yeah, and engaging. I mean, he's just, he's not deluded about the world.
 He's just so positive. It's amazing. His knowledge of the word is...
 Is it number two? Yeah, number two.<br/>
 ...decently in order.<br/>
 Number two, sorry. His knowledge of the word is outstanding.
 I mean, he must have quoted from memory 30 or 40 verses the first night.
 Oh, the first night, I don't know.<br/>
 The one of the other sessions he taught, I thought I'm going to write in every scripture
 that he quotes and I recorded 28 of them.
 Wow.<br/>
 I mean, just, just amazing.<br/>
 And I guess number three would be, I don't know if it would be his stories, which were
 awesome, but they'd also go under the funny of number one.
 I love how he engaged with people.<br/>
 Like he just sort of walk out in the crowd and he'd stop
 and he'd make eye contact.<br/>
 And he'd give somebody a word of encouragement or do whatever.
 And then he'd go back to his story and stuff.
 But he just, it kind of felt like having a dad there that was just loving on his
 kids and encouraging them to, you know, go further with the Lord.
 All right.<br/>
 On that note of 10 stories and have you that, tell me or tell our listeners the
 story of the first time you ever met Bobby in Toronto?
 Well, this is probably what babe eight or nine years ago,
 something like that.<br/>
 Yeah, I think so.<br/>
 And Alan and I were coming into a meeting.
 It was for the prophetic team or the ministry teams and the prophetic team or
 something. And it was with Bobby Connor and Paul Keith Davis that were in town
 for one of the conferences. And I'd never seen Bobby Connor before.
 And we sort of came in and it was starting.
 And so Paul Keith and Bobby were sitting in the front row,
 facing away from us.<br/>
 And we sat in the second or third row<br/>
 kind of behind them, didn't we?<br/>
 That's right.<br/>
 And anyway, when Bobby got up to speak, he turned around.
 And I just was like, started twitching
 because he looked so much like my dad.
 Let me tell her, did he look physically like your dad?
 Yeah.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 So he looked like--<br/>
 I mean, other than he kind of spikes his hair,
 my dad combed it to the side.<br/>
 His eyes and everything look the same,
 his like teeth and the way that he smiled are the same.
 The only thing that's different is his nose.
 I mean, even his ears look the same and his hands
 and the way he would use his hands while he was talking
 was exactly like dad.
</p><ul>
  <li>Crazy.
  </li><li>Yeah, and his laugh.
 Like when he would sort of laugh at his own jokes.
 So I was like, I have to get out of here.
 I have to get out of here.
 And I remember saying to you, I need to go.
 Which is funny because I'd never seen you, you know, I'd known you for a couple of years by then.
 And for all intents and purposes, you were caught on quote over the death of your father.
 As in, there was no quote unquote residue.
 There was no issues per se.
 Never saw you grieving.
 You know, it was a very matter of fact thing because a lot of the grief you'd
 processed, et cetera, et cetera.
 So were you surprised by the reaction that you were having?
 Seeing Bobby?
 Um, I, I would still say at that point, I still thought about dad every day.
 Okay.
 You know, at some point, and certainly I would have a hard week around father's
 day and that kind of stuff.
 Um, but I was surprised, but I mean, I'd never seen anybody that looked that much
 like him.
 So, you know, you think about looking at somebody who was a dead loved one, you
 know, it's just, it was freaky.
 Okay.
 Continue.
 And, uh, so he, you know, spoke on whatever.
 I don't know I barely made it through and he stopped and prophesied over me about being a dreamer
 I don't remember exactly what he said, but I remember I couldn't make eye contact with him because it was just too painful
 right and
 then Paul Keith got up and spoke about something and and
 So I thought it was sort of wrapping up or heading into minister time and I was saying, you know, I want to go and
 And I mean you were like a horse babe like if you need to go you need to go, you know
 I couldn't really I couldn't really explain what was going on
 And he stood up and he said, "You know, I feel like the Lord is saying there's people here that are trapped in grief or something."
 I forget how he explained it, but he said, "You've lost close family members, but it's been many years and it's still affecting you and whatever."
 And I just lost it, you know. So I started crying. There's two or three other people that stood up.
 and he came over and prayed and then he prayed for the other people.
 It's just real sweet and whatever.
 But as I was crying and just saying, "God, it's still so hard.
 I still miss him."
 The Lord said to me, "What do you miss the most?"
 I said, "God, I just miss his hugs.
 I miss my dad's hugs."
 moved on to a couple different other words and I just said, "Babe, I want to go."
 So we scooted out the side and went over to say, "Goodbye," to Stuart Lendley, who
 were at the front but at the side, packing things up because people were starting to
 move around and everything.
 So it went up and just said, "We need to go and we'll see you later," and whatever.
 Just as we were getting ready to leave, Bobby had been praying for somebody on the front
 row.
 He stopped and he said, "Young lady, could you come over here?"
 So I stopped and I'm just thinking, "God, I can't take anymore."
 And he said, "The Lord just told me to give you a hug."
 So I went over and he hugged me and I bawled.
 And then I remember saying to him, because I felt so embarrassed and I was like, "I'm
 sorry."
 It's just that, and he said, "I look like your father."
 And I was like, yeah.
 So God must have told him that.
 So then I, yeah.
 So this is the first time I've seen him since then.
 I mean, he had come to Gray Center in '09,
 but we were administering in Norway.
 And I was so glad that we were gone.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Even though John and Carol were in town
 for the same conference,
 I was so sad that we missed John and Carol,
 but I just was so glad to miss,
 you know, Bobby, because I just didn't.
 I didn't think I could take it.
 So I did cry the first night when he came in and whatever,
 because I just, I forgot how much he looks like him.
 And then I sort of got over.
 I actually would just concentrate on his nose,
 because it looked nothing like my dad.
 So I'd be like, you're fine.
 Look at his nose. It's not your father.
 That's a great look for a public speaker.
 So, but he was, I mean, amazing, so good.
 Oh, he absolutely was hysterical.
 Outstanding.
 It's like a one man revelation machine.
 He would just stand out and he would just,
 it's not that he would just quote scripture.
 It's he would we scripture into whatever he was saying.
 Right.
 And he's an amazing storyteller.
 I mean, I know the recordings just to be able to go back and listen, because you
 just, I was trying to keep, you know, um,
 let's try to let my heart hear it and then I'll process it later.
 Well, I posted something to Instagram.
 I tried to take a picture.
 Like I try to take notes of RT, which was really easy because RT is methodical.
 And then I try to take notes of Bobby and he's so ADD that I was just like, and we're
 done here.
 And there's a difference between the two of them.
 What was your favorite Bobby story?
 Um, well, before I tell you my favorite Bobby story, let me tell you what I loved
 about RT.
 Oh, yeah.
 Tell us two top three things about RT.
 My top three favorite things about RT.
 One would be, and I don't know how obvious this would be, I guess, but his sense of humor.
 I say that because, you know, we got to spend a, you know, more time behind the scenes and
 watch him and Jeff's relationship where they've known each other for years.
 And just watching their verbal sparring is hysterical because, you know, Jeff and Artie
 are very quick-witted and Artie seems to love the British sense of humor.
 I mean, you lived there longer than I did.
 So this quick-witted banter was just awesome to watch.
 And you got a taste of that, because you saw him and Jeff ribby-chiller when they were
 speaking, but yeah, absolutely his impeccable sense of humor.
 And then you got this with everything he preached, but his love of God's word is amazing.
 Yeah, it really is.
 But not just, there's a real danger in Evangelicism where we make loving the word of God and
 idol. So you have people who are more in love with the word of God than the person, the word of God.
 And Artie doesn't fall into that category. He is using the Bible to read the Bible, to love the
 Bible, but to apply it to his life. So just hearing his insights of what he does with the Bible and
 how he loves to read the Bible and the prayers that he prays daily was really touching. I loved
 hearing that. And then the third thing, which isn't so much what he said, but I think comes
 out into who he is, is that he has lived really, really well. I know he's got a book coming out
 called "Ain't Over 'Til It's Over," but in terms of where he is in life and how he has stayed true
 to his call and how he hasn't had any moral failures and he hasn't screwed up and I just think
 is rare and to be commanded. Plus, I'm going to throw in a bonus one. This is a bonus number
 four. His ability to spend the gap between charismatic people who hold him in high regard
 and evangelicals, some of who hold him in high regard is amazing, that he can have the ears of
 both those groups of people and leaders in both those groups of people. Billy Graham has him out,
 James Dobbs and his friend. And then he was just speaking to Rick Joyner before, and him and John
 Paul Jackson are great friends. I just think that's amazing that he can be understood and
 love and connect with both these disparate groups and the body crisis is amazing.
 It really is amazing. Yeah, he certainly crosses over the boundaries really well.
 All right, you tell me your favorite Bobby Conner story.
 It's hard to pick between all of the different stories he told. I certainly like the one you're
 you're going to talk about. But I think I'm stuck somewhere between the one where he almost
 blew up his town, the one where he was riding on a tricycle going 82 miles an hour
 being pulled behind a pickup truck. And the one where he was in that drama class
 and dropped or jumped off of the scaffolding at the top, having made some sort of a
 something out of rope and curtains to cushion is or slow down his fall.
 So it sounds like, I mean, every story you tell, I would feel for his mother, like I was like,
 oh my gosh, I'd be in trauma if my son was doing that.
 Well, I would feel for that until he told the story about how him and his brother would
 shoot cigarettes out with her mouth with a 22 rifle. And his mum popped her head out and said,
 "Bye, stop doing that. You're wasting good shells."
 race and good amnesia
 You covered some great bases there. I think the story of the classic story of Bobby
 Punching and knocking at a horse and being known for doing that and then him wrestling a bear and the bear winning had me in stitches
 in fact
 Somebody tweet I was jimmyly finished tweeted the only thing more entertaining than Bobby Connor is watching Alan react to Bobby
 corner because I was probably on the floor at that point.
 But the story he told this morning in first service, I've never heard anything about it.
 I was so funny.
 Basically, I won't go into details because I'm going to encourage you to go listen to
 it for yourself.
 Basically, he falls on top of a, I think it was a band saw and splits his stomach open
 and his entire contents of his gut fall out, all his guts, all his internal organs fall
 out and the how he survived in the care of his grandfather is beyond me. That sounds trauma
 terrifying. His mother was away rescuing his blind niece. I mean, it's just the most
 Yeah, collection of the most calamitous and dysfunctional
 situations you've ever heard of, but just absolutely amazing.
 Baby, do you have time to do some listeners questions before we head to bed?
 Yes.
 Alright, Philip asked us, "I have a question about how you respond to a prophetic word you've received.
 How should you pray for an as yet unfulfilled promise?"
 I've heard it said that you should declare to God as promises, but when I do that, I feel like I'm
 on the verge of trying a strong arm God into doing something. He hasn't forgotten and doesn't need
 my reminder, but neither do I want to sit passively, waiting for it to happen. I'd love to hear your
 perspective on this. I mean, I think because all prophecy is an invitation, you just say, yes,
 you know, you keep saying yes, you say yes with your heart, yes with your lifestyle, yes, with what
 you're spending your time, you know, preparing. So you prepare in the direction of the prophetic
 words and you just keep saying yes. And you know, you don't need to make it happen. But when the
 Lord starts opening doors and you can walk through them because your heart attitude has been yes.
 Yeah, and I would say don't despise the day of small beginnings. So if you have a prophetic word
 about you being a great preacher, but you're not getting invitations to preach in greatness,
 but you do get invitation to speak to Sunday school class, no matter how embryonic the offer,
 if it's in line with what your prophetic words are saying, take them, so where you want to grow.
 And I would say that. But the other thing is the thing that predates
 both any of those things is scripture says that you're to test prophetic words and you're to
 weigh prophetic words. So I'd be testing them and weighing them but assuming that you've tested
 them and you've weighed them and you think that they're the Lord, I love writing out my prophetic
 words and praying them back to the Lord. Because what that does is it doesn't strong arm God into
 anything that actually prepares your heart for something. You begin to change the way you think
 about who you are and you come and tell them what God's saying. So I think it's very important
 to believe what God's saying and then take baby steps towards that destiny.
 I remember once at one point in time when Chris Valleton was in town, he said something about,
 he gave me a prophetic word about something and I said to him, "Well, I'm not walking in that
 yet." And he said, "Yes, that's because you haven't agreed with God about it yet."
 Right.
 So, Philip, if you want more detailed answers to that or if anybody else wants more detailed
 down to that. We have a five CD box at teaching or you can just download them on our website.
 I'll put a link in the show notes to a whole host about things about prophetic ministry,
 but I'll single out the teaching that talks about how you handle prophetic works.
 All right, babe, do you have a question?
 -Woop, whoop. Do you want me to read this question?
 -Sure.
 -So this question is from Danielle Holtz and it says, "Hi Alan and AJ,
 Last year, I heard AJ give a talk at emanate about Halloween.
 Before you run away from the computer
 because you received so many negative emails
 concerning this topic,
 I want to assure you that I took a lot from this talk.
 To say I was convinced would be an understatement.
 I actually thought about this topic a lot
 over the past year.
 One thing that really hit me was the verse AJ read
 that was something along the lines of,
 do not do anything to do with anything that even appears to be evil.
 I think you're referring to avoid all appearance of evil.
 Do you know what verse that is?
 Avoid all appearance of evil.
 I do, but finish the question.
 Okay.
 So we are approaching Halloween.
 And my good friend invited me to a bonfire and said to dress up.
 I was recently told that a bonfire originated from something known as a bonfire.
 Anyway, I was wondering how I can apply this talk to my life, but also not become legalistic
 about it.
 I would love to attend my friends get together, but I don't really want to dress up, nor do
 I want to celebrate anything pertaining to Halloween.
 Any advice?
 Well, first of all, we don't get a lot of nights with females about your Halloween talk.
 No, I think probably what you're referring to is the first year I posted something about
 it on Facebook.
 On Facebook, I got so many comments of people that were had very interesting views.
 The thing is, I don't want to be known for being the people who are against Halloween.
 I'm against Halloween.
 Yeah.
 That's not my issue.
 My issue, that's not our life message.
 No.
 That's not the thing we can serve ourselves with.
 No.
 It's really far from our life.
 Right.
 That's one day a year, folks.
 Right.
 And it's not something we even, you know, anyway.
 Yeah.
 However, to your question.
 to your question.
 I won't say a thing.
 Well, I don't know.
 Is the bonfire actually on Halloween?
 Is it, you know, I mean, for myself, I wouldn't go to anything that was on Halloween and dress
 up just because I understand what that day is about.
 And even though, you know, my heart is not participating in it, it's just too important
 to me that it's clear that I don't support it, if that makes sense.
 But I also don't think that God wants you tied up in knots and religious about it either.
 Right.
 I would ask the Holy Spirit the same question you asked us and just let the peace of God
 rule your heart.
 I mean, if you want to go or if it's not on Halloween and you know whatever, you can
 always go to anything that's you don't want to dress up.
 allowed to have boundaries and decide what you want to do for anything. So yeah, anyway.
 Last question. Brandi Essos. It's been coming up a lot through him declares that perhaps we're
 sometimes too familiar with God. I'm having a hard time reconciling the fear of the Lord
 with what I have experienced as love to be like. How can I walk in intimacy with someone that I'm
 afraid of? If he's not angry with me because Jesus paid for my sin, then why should I be afraid
 of a brilliant question.
 Great question.
 A question is plural.
 Great question, Pandy.
 I mean, I would start by saying my understanding of the fear of the Lord has always been more
 of a reverence than awe than a terror.
 So it's more of a like, he's amazing and he's holy and it inspires you towards right relationship
 rather than a terror of God, if that makes sense.
 What's your thoughts, babe?
  </li><li>Well, I mostly agree with that,
 but I think you read in Revelation where John the beloved,
 so the disciples who's closest to Jesus,
 sees Jesus in his glory,
 he falls down like a dead man.
 And again, I do think there's an element of,
 yeah, of course there's awe and reverential fear.
 But I think the question perhaps is more to do
 with people being too familiar with God.
 I was thinking about that earlier and I was thinking,
 so for example, I've noticed that the people
 who are over familiar with me
 don't have the relationship with me
 to be operating at the level at which they're operating.
 So for example, I remember, so Josh Parsons
 and I goof off a lot at work.
 We've got similar sort of sense of humor
 and we'll make jokes and comments
 and often at each other's expense, and there's this real rapport going back and forth.
 And I love it, and it's really amazing.
 But that's born out of us having walked together for many, many years, and just having a real
 mutual love and respect for one another.
 And the reason it's funny is we're playing off as if that love and mutual respect wasn't
 there.
 And so I've had people come up who I don't have any relationship with, maybe I've not
 even talk to them and and lob a joke at me like Joshua, but we actually don't have any
 relationship. And so they're being too familiar with me. And it's not that what they're saying
 is anything different from Josh, but they don't actually have the history with me to be making
 that sort of right. So I see yeah, Christians. And I would say it's not too it's of course
 they're all familiar, but they're walking in presumption rather than in relationship.
 And I think by the very fact you asked that question, Brandi, gives me a sense of confidence
 that that's not something you're going to fall into. I think the trick to remember is that Jesus
 is our leader, that we're following Jesus. Anytime that we are leading him, I would say we've
 absolutely stepped into Aaron, we've become too, you know, over familiar. But there's a sense that
 you, you know, scripture, the Lord said, this is the one I steam. And he lists off a whole
 load of things. And one of them is that he that trembles at my word. And so there's an
 element where, you know, you have a real honor for the Lord. And the reason that you
 are doing things isn't out of a religious nod. And I will have to do this. But it's
 out of a genuine love to please the Lord. It's motivated by love. It's certainly not
 motivated by fear, but you understand I have this rich relationship with you Lord, I don't
 want to do anything to damage it. And so as a result of that love, you start making lifestyle
 choices that reflect that. I think where we get into danger or like, yeah, God doesn't care,
 he's somehow indifferent to my sin and so I can do whatever I want. I think at that point,
 you're missing the fear of the Lord in your life. Right.
 You've made a different presumption.
 You've made a different presumption.
 You've made a different presumption.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Does that make sense?
 I think too in the end, Brandy, you know, what I kept thinking about all weekend was
 John 3, 16 and 17.
 So which, you know, again, most of us probably know that off the top of our head, but for
 God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him
 shall not perish but have eternal life, for God did not send His Son into the world to
 to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through him.
 And so I just, I think too, like keeping in mind,
 God's motivation and his love for you,
 he has so much love for you that he would actually trade his son for you.
 And so I guess I don't have a hard time with the fear of the Lord
 and the love of God being in balance with one another.
 So maybe some of it is just saying,
 can you show me how to understand that in its balance?
 Ta-da.
 That's not bad.
 Given the fact it's 1 a.m. in the morning and we're making up answers.
 It's just craziness.
 You know the other thing we completely forgot to mention, babe.
 What do we forget?
 What do we announce at the conference that we were so super excited by?
 Dun dun dun.
 This is now I wish we had the music.
 We need the music.
 Wait, I'll do.
 No, no, no, no, stop.
 some pitter padding ready ready and what are you doing?
 I'm trying to do a drum roll. Okay, stop. We announced that we are after much prayer and
 discussion and planning. We are launching year two of the School of Supernatural Life.
 women can't do sound effects. That was my craft.
 And it is going to be open to everybody who has graduated from first year.
 So if you are one of our alumni, we love you and we miss you.
 And if you would like to come back for a year two, you can read all about it at
 the School of Supernatural Life.
 Here's what we're going to do. Here's our closing thoughts.
 We're wrapping this thing up.
 It's we would really encourage you to grab the MP3 from the Heaven
 Declares Conference. I'll put a link in the show notes.
 You can.
 You can buy them. There are dollar nine and nine each.
 If you want to sample by all means go to Grace Nurse podcast and listen to Bobbie Conner speaking
 by the first and second service and you'll get an idea of just what you're in for. But really
 encourage you to pick those up. We're excited about this week with Dan Farrelly all the way from
 Reading, California. We picked him up at the airport tonight, fed the man pizza and he's teaching
 the school this week. So we're excited about being with him. Until next week, we will see you later.
 See you later.
