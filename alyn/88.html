<p> I live in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones.
 Ask me why I'm so excited.<br/>
 Why are you so excited?<br/>
 Because I just ate the sound of pizza.
 Yes, you did.<br/>
 We have had a fantastic week intermingled with some very hard parts.
 Correct.<br/>
 That's correct.<br/>
 If you were listening to the podcast last week, you would have heard a friend of ours.
 Died super suddenly.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 He was 30 years old, just turned 30.<br/>
 Everyone was about to move into their new home.
 And to everyone's shock, he literally just dropped dead.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And the autopsy revealed nothing.<br/>
 Yeah, absolutely nothing.<br/>
 And then we had a memorial service this Thursday.
 So that's kind of overshadowed the whole week.
 Yeah, it definitely has.<br/>
 It's been a difficult process.<br/>
 Yeah, but it is amazing how the memorial service
 brings a sense of, and I don't mean closure, but it makes you face the fact that everybody that you
 know who knew him were all there to honor his life. And that does something.
 Yeah, and there was lots to honor about him. And it's amazing when you know where he is,
 and you know it's a way better place. It does really help. It's like,
 "Okay, this isn't what we wanted, but he's happy."
</p><ul>
  <li>Right.
  </li><li>So, yeah, it was a very hard week.
  </li><li>It was a very hard week, but it was great to see
 everybody at the memorial service.
  </li><li>It was, yeah.
  </li><li>And it did something in my heart,
 which I wasn't expecting it to.
 And that thing was just the, okay,
 'cause I think I was in disbelief.
 I made a comment, I had the approach of sharing
 at his memorial, and I said, "It's really hard to say goodbye
 to someone you can't believe is gone. And I think that's the closure that I'm talking
 about that you come to the realization that, okay, he is not here.
 Yeah, it still doesn't seem real though in some ways, does it? Like I still kind of expect
 to see him tomorrow night.
 Let's talk about good stuff that happened. Okay.
 I had the privilege of speaking at the belonging and amazing church in Nashville.
 Yeah, it really is a great church.
 We'll talk a little bit more about that in a second. Food wise, I already mentioned
 we had the sauce, tell everybody about Desano's pizza
 because I don't think we've talked enough about it
 on the podcast.
  </li><li>Well, it is really good pizza
 and that's from somebody who doesn't like pizza.
  </li><li>Right, you don't like pizza traditionally.
  </li><li>I'm not a pizza fan, I never crave pizza.
 If somebody offers me pizza, I'm usually like,
 "Ah, can we eat something else?"
 Except for Desano's pizza.
  </li><li>And what's so good about Desano's pizza?
  </li><li>I don't even know.
 It's a secret sauce.
 Well, they ship all their ingredients in from Italy,
 including their flour and all that kind of stuff.
 So it doesn't make my stomach feel
 jippy like other pizzas do.
  </li><li>So all of their meat, their tomatoes, their cheese,
  </li><li>Basil everything.
  </li><li>flour, salt, all imported weekly from Italy.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And then their ovens, which weigh 6,000 pounds each,
 they had them shipped in.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And it's made from the rock of Mount Vesuvius.
  </li><li>Which obviously must make for better pizza.
 I mean--
  </li><li>How hard did the ovens get?
  </li><li>900 degrees, I think.
 We only cook for like a minute and a half.
 Right.
 Now, you seconds your pizza is done.
 Astonishing pizza.
 If you're ever in Nashville, you need to go to Tasanos.
 It's called the Sanos bakery, which is weird because I guess I
 guess they do bake pizza.
 You know what my revelation about pizza was tonight?
 What was your yes, I do.
 What was your revelation?
 My pizza is basically an open face taco.
 Wow.
 So I break Italian people would be so proud.
 I break my taco diet for pizza.
 On the topic of food, we also ate the butcher town hall.
 We did any place where they serve you a large platter of meat on a cutting board is a good place in my books.
 The menu basically is pick whichever pound of meat you would like.
 Yes, and the sides that come with it.
 Yes, and we'll serve you on a wooden slab.
 It's true.
 I'm like, I have to say their Brussels sprouts are outstanding.
 Things you never thought you'd say.
 I never thought I'd say that, but it's yeah, really good.
 And then our weather was crazy last week we're snowed in for three days.
 It's true.
 This week, me and Abby went for bike ride because it was 70 degrees.
 Yeah, it's crazy weather. Totally crazy.
 I saw Caroline Hallam posted on Facebook a picture of her feet today out in the sunshine
 and last week at this time in snow boots out in the snow.
 I was like, yes, that is how weird our life is right now.
 And I think MJ is turning into a prophetic weatherman.
 You might be.
 He woke up this morning.
 He's like, daddy, it's going to storm today.
 And I was like, it's not going to storm today.
 And then put them down for bed, look at the weather forecast.
 It's predicting storms for tonight.
 Well, we should start paying attention to that child.
 Then we really should see if you can get the lottery numbers.
 Just pick out some numbers, any numbers, MJ, no reason.
 You had your head down this week.
 Yes.
 We were reviewing the week and I realized I went out lots.
 You stayed home.
 Yes, which is never that good for me.
 You get cabin fever pretty quick.
 Not a homebody at all.
 But yeah, I had a lot to get done this week, so it is what it is.
 Yeah, you were helping organize the memorial service.
 Yeah.
 And then obviously running our family, but you were also preparing teaching on Romans, which you're going to start tomorrow.
 Did we talk about your teaching on Ephesians?
 I don't know.
 I can't remember actually.
 That was a couple of weeks ago, maybe two weeks ago.
 But what did you do in Ephesians?
 We went verse by verse through the book of Ephesians.
 You're like a boss.
 a boss. Thank you. Thank you. And that's what we'll start tomorrow with the year two students
 will start going first by verse through the book of Romans. Just super exciting. I mean,
 I love it. I get the more I read it, the more excited I get, the more encouraged I get.
 Well, what I love about you is when we started designing year two, right at the outset, you said,
 I want to teach the book of Romans, verse by verse and the book of Ephesians, verse by verse.
 And I was like, "Okay."
 And then you put the rubber to the road and did it.
 Yeah.
 I have taught through Ephesians once before, but it was about 15 years ago in a Bible study,
 like just in a random Bible study of like, "Hey, who wants to get more into the word?
 Okay, let's look at Ephesians."
 And I haven't done it since then and I had no notes, but I just was like, "I love the
 book of Ephesians."
 And then I love Romans.
 I mean, you know, I love, I do it with Song of Solomon as well.
 It's fun.
 All right.
 So our topic for this week comes out the fact that I was teaching at the belonging this
 week.
 First of all, let's talk about the belonging in Alex and Henry.
 Alex and Henry are amazing.
 They're from Melbourne, Australia.
 And they won the green card lottery, didn't they, like, four years ago or something like
 that?
 And so they just up and moved here.
 And he's a music producer and a worship leader and that kind of stuff.
 And they just started collecting people.
 I'm telling this story, maybe I'm wrong, but from what I remember and from what I understand
 is they just were kind of, I think they were kind of alarmed at how many Christians weren't
 in church or had been burned out on church or because of their travel schedule didn't
 go to go church.
 So they just started meeting in their house and soon it grew so large that they couldn't
 contain the number of people in their house.
 And then they moved to meeting at Rocket Town, which is a venue here in Nashville.
 And now they're doing a phenomenal job.
 They started on Tuesday nights.
 They've now started a whole second service, which is almost full.
 They're going to have to get a Rocket Town soon, I would think.
 On a Sunday night.
 And anyway, they're real pastors, real leaders, super humble, super meek.
 We've loved getting to know them.
 And they're a married couple, and so they pass it together.
 And I guess they have been finding that other people have been finding that difficult.
 And so they'd heard that we do teaching on women in ministry.
 So this is Alan, would you come and teach on women in ministry?
 Of course, I'd love to.
 And so we had the great job going up there Tuesday, M tonight.
 Just we just finished teaching there when for pizza came home.
 You did a fantastic job as well, babe.
 Say that again, but you did a fantastic job.
 Thank you.
 I really obviously I love teaching.
 Obviously, I love teaching that topic.
 We've had a bunch of people ask us to share on women and ministry on the podcast.
 The trouble with that is it's one of those topics that needs a systematic teaching,
 not a conversation, which is why we haven't done it.
 Do you know what I mean?
 Just to talk about women and ministry on the podcast, you'd be leaving large gaping holes,
 which wouldn't do the topic, the service, and to teach on it would probably take a minimum
 of an hour and an hour and 10 minutes, which maybe we'll produce some teaching on that
 that's that people don't have to come to church in here.
 Yeah.
 But it was a lot of fun to be able to share and they got great worship.
 They're just a great vibrant church.
 It's a stellar team.
 They're just all amazing.
 There's lots of SOL cell graduates as well, around, which is great.
 So I think hugs and stuff.
 I think that they streamed the service.
 If they did, and if you're interested, I'll put a link in the show notes.
 And so if you're interested, you can go watch it.
 I'll see if I can find that.
 Anyway, I'll say this a little bit.
 For those of you who don't know me,
 don't know my views on women in ministry,
 I was raised in a church environment
 that didn't support women in ministry.
 And by that, I mean, we didn't have women who taught
 and we didn't have women who were leaders.
 I'm now married to a woman preacher
 and half our staff at Grace and Our Women.
 And I actively encourage, train and release women in ministry.
  </li><li>So you come a long way, really?
  </li><li>Yeah, so something changed.
 And that's what I shared on.
 But in preparation for sharing, I said, "Hey guys, this is a really important topic to me for three reasons.
 One, you know, what I just said.
 Two, actually some of the biggest breakthroughs in my life have come through women."
 Yeah.
 And if I hadn't settled the issue of women in ministry, it's possible I would have missed what God had for me
 because I didn't like the conduit in which it came.
 Yeah, for sure.
 And then third of all, I just think it's a vital topic for the church.
 Yeah.
 I think part of the reason we're not as effective as we could be is half our workforce isn't allowed to speak.
 Yeah.
 Depending on your church background.
 Yeah.
 So I thought it would be fun tonight to talk about some of the pivotal moments in life that involved women.
 Okay.
 Let's do it.
 Do you want to go first or do you want me to go first?
 I can go first.
 I can go first.
 I think probably the first person or people that I would talk about are my cousin, Jana,
 in my aunt Joan. They were the first ones for me that, you know, well, they prayed me into the
 kingdom. My aunt was the first really super prophetic person I ever encountered who would have
 crazy dreams about things that were happening in my life and come and love me enough to confront
 me. And you know, Jana, of course, prayed for me every single day for, I don't know, seven or eight
 years until I got saved and invited me to every youth retreat.
 And, you know, if it wasn't for those two, I probably wouldn't have gotten saved, you
 know, because they were just persistently pursuing me and loving me even when I was horrific.
 So pretty pivotal then.
 So fairly pivotal.
 Yeah.
 Fairly pivotal.
 And even, you know, going forward from there, Janice and Anna and Joan have been huge cheerleaders
 of me and just really, as I would press into God and do things like, Oh gosh, I think
 maybe God's calling me to speak.
 They'd be like, yeah, go for it.
 You know, so just, yeah, amazing, amazing people in my life.
 And I'm so thankful for them.
 Very good.
 Who's your first one?
 My first one is my mother.
 I'm sure if she was alive, she'd be tickled pink to think that she was a pivotal
 woman in ministry.
 But here's the thing she was in ministry.
 She didn't teach or preach, although I bet she would have been amazing at it.
 Oh, she would have been an excellent teacher.
 But what she modeled for me was the ministry of helps and hospitality.
 Yeah.
 You know, whatever you grew up with, you'd consider normal.
 Right.
 Our house was constantly filled with people.
 Right.
 Always.
 I mean, it was rare that we did not have people several times a week for lunch, for dinner.
 My mother was just such a high influencer, and she was always welcoming what we would call
 all waifs and strays into our house.
  </li><li>It didn't a lot of those waifs and strays
 end up giving their lives the Lord.
  </li><li>Yeah, many of them.
 But my mum was this equal opportunity lover of all people.
 And you would always have people in our house
 to the point where I just thought that was normal.
 New person at church guaranteed their our house for lunch,
 visiting speaker guaranteed their our house for lunch.
 So I just grew up with this assumption
 that everybody was hospitable.
 And, you know, it was unfair because my mother's benchmark for hospitality was astonishing.
 So I think my joy for having people stay in our house, my joy for even looking after the speakers
 when they come to Grace Center, just hospitality in general came from my mom at left an incredible
 mark on my life.
 You know that verse in Hebrews that says some people have entertained angels unaware.
 Yeah.
 I don't know how many angels my mom had in her house just because there are a number of people
 that we had to stay to eat, that's not as terrible, to share our meal with.
 You didn't actually eat them.
 Not to my recollection.
 I just thought I should clarify.
 But yeah, my mum just, and then that other verse, whatever you do work unto the Lord,
 that was my mum's life verse.
 Everything she did was for the Lord.
 Yeah.
 And so that left a huge impact on me.
 Yeah.
 So there you go, mum, but you didn't think I'd say that, but you were a huge impact to me.
 All right.
 My number two or, I guess, three, I don't know where I am now.
 would be Carol or not.
 Okay, twinsies.
 You're saying Carol is what?
 I'm saying Carol.
 You tell us in Carol's stories.
 I'll tell some.
 I think for me, watching Carol from before the revival started
 and after and just watching her let God transform her
 and let God speak to her about who she was actually called
 to be and then go after those things
 and actually start speaking and start doing all the things
 she never did before.
 was such an encouragement to me.
 And then in addition to that,
 she was just a spiritual mom to me
 that really, her and John together really loved me
 back to life, but she loved me enough to call me on my junk.
 And she loved me enough not to look away,
 to actually go, "Hey, you know what, that thing
 "that you just did right there, that wasn't great.
 "And here's why."
 And that kind of stuff.
 So she never pushed her way in,
 but she knew that she hadn't in,
 and she's brilliant at loving others.
  </li><li>Yeah, I obviously had the incredible privilege,
 which I still can't quite believe that I got to do this,
 but traveling around the world with John and Carol
 was such a gift from God to me.
 It's very, very hard for us to quantify the impact
 John and Carol had in our life.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But I would absolutely say John and Carol,
 because I learned tons from Carol.
 I learned from Carol deliverance.
 I learned from Carol keys to healing.
 She's one of the biggest cheerleaders we have in life.
 Every time we speak to her, we're constantly encouraged.
 I remember one story that just made me really, really laugh
 and I still enjoy in hindsight was we were ministering,
 they were ministering at Holy Trinity Brompton.
 It was a 10 year revival anniversary.
 um, in a very, very, yeah, it was a 10 year anniversary of the outpouring of Holy 20 Brompton.
 So John and Carol, where the other church was packed and it was kind of pandemonium.
 There was just manifestations left right in the center and John was preaching and
 there's so much noise. There was a guy prophesying so loudly. There was a woman speaking in tongues.
 There was, there was a guy up in the balcony going, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop. You know,
 I just like, what is going on? And I remember halfway through the service, just me leaning
 over to Carol and just saying, "Carol, can I be honest? Sometimes I can't tell if a manifestation
 is the Holy Spirit, somebody's flesh or demonic." And Carol just leaned over to me and said,
 "I'll lay into a little secret. I still can't sometimes." And right about that time, John was
 doing a closing altar call, and as soon as you mentioned the name, "Jesus," some woman stood up
 in the middle and started effing and blinding the middle of the church. And remember Carol leaning
 over to me going pretty sure that was demonic though.
 But you know what?
 Carol taught me never to be scared of the devil.
 Yeah.
 But I mean both of them did.
 But I remember so many times Carol would just go for it and deliverance.
 You know somebody rolling around on the floor snarling and the ministry team would be too
 scared to go near the person.
 Carol would just like wade over like this lion ass and cast out this demon and just
 so and then even behind the scenes watching Carol prepare to speak and just watching
 on her utter reliance on the Holy Spirit. You would imagine 10 plus years, now 20 plus
 years with the Holy Spirit, just this automatic assumption that everything's going to be great.
 But no, just this gentle utter reliance on the Holy Spirit to show up. She would just say,
 "Holy Spirit, if you don't show up, I'm just a little lady with nothing."
 And just her humility and her love for Jesus. I just love that her ego never ever gets in the way
 of what she's trying to do and she's fearless. I love her to be.
 Yeah. She also has a remarkable ability to drink horrible, noxious fluids if somebody
 tells them that they're healthy. Oh my gosh. It's probably the only thing wrong.
 I'd rather not. I remember we did Candida Clans, the other me,
 Daryl. And she would maybe drink this tincture called para a and para b. I mean, it was single
 the worst thing I've ever put in my body.
 She would just drink it.
 I'd be like, what is wrong with you?
 And I think I nearly died on that glance.
  </li><li>Let's find a watch.
  </li><li>All right, you got Carolina.
 I piggybacked on that.
 I've got somebody that I don't know if most of our listeners
 don't even know who it is.
 Maybe a small group of people in Glasgow.
 Pauline Welch was a student at the School of Ministry
 in Toronto, originally hailed from Glasgow.
 Was it Glasgow, either?
 a church that I would drive through and sneak into and get filled with the Holy Spirit.
 And I remember one time we were at a conference.
 I forget what the conference was.
 But she came up to me and somewhat timidly gave me a prophetic word that completely changed
 my life.
 She came up, I think she'd done the school and she gave me a prophetic word and just
 said, "Alen, when I looked at you earlier, I saw the word 'move' written over your
 head."
 Somewhat simple word.
 But that word caused me to move to Toronto.
 I took a side, some time I prayed, I fasted.
 I set aside a couple of days in Glasgow actually to just go and be away with the Lord and
 pray through it.
 And the Lord, out of that one word that she gave me gave me a blueprint for the rest
 of my life.
 And the first step of that was to move to Toronto.
 I just prayed and said, Lord, what do you think?
 Out of that wrote a nine page letter to my elders and said, this is what I'm thinking
 of doing.
 But again, it was her simple word that caused an absolute pivotal change in my life.
 Wow.
 Well done, Pauline Welsh. Just an example of somebody being faithful, giving a word that might not have
 meant sense to her or didn't seem that prophetic or that profound, but had huge ramifications.
 We just never know, do you? High five, Pauline. Yeah, come on. My next one would be Patricia King.
 Oh, good one. We were talking about her tonight. We were. So, Patricia King is a Canadian. She now
 now lives in Phoenix, but she is somebody who,
 the first time I met her, I think was either late '94
 or early '95, I think it was late '94,
 and she came and she did a three week
 deliverance school.
  </li><li>Now that sounds like fun.
  </li><li>Right, and there was, I think there was 20 or 25 of us
 that had signed up for it, and she just taught all this stuff
 it was amazing. But it was really fun too because I'd never seen anybody that knew the word like she did.
 Right, she's amazing. She, you know, like she does. But I mean, I'm just thinking in terms of the
 memory. But I remember there was a couple of guys who were in Bible college who maybe had a,
 they maybe had a hard time that, you know, she was teaching, although they had signed up to come to
 to it. So whatever. But they would try and like throw her a loop. What do you think about
 this verse? And they'd pick some obscure verse and Patricia without even opening her
 Bible would go, well, you need to look at the context of that verse. What you find is the
 verse before says this and the verse after says this and the whole overall of the chapter
 says this. And you know, and I just remember looking at her going, I want to know the
 word like that, you know, right. And then when it came to the end of the, I felt like the
 The final week of the school was actually her and some of her team members who flew out.
 We're going to do a deliverance session with each one of the students that had been on
 the school.
 It was like a two-hour deliverance session.
 I showed up.
 You didn't know who was doing your deliverance.
 I ended up with Patricia and a woman named Ruth.
 So I went in the room and she just said, "The Lord said not to do deliverance.
 I had gotten a lot of deliverance during this school already.
 Right.
 But I was, but to prophesy over you.
 So she said, I spent last night writing out things that the Lord was saying about you.
 And so for two hours, she just prophesied over me.
 And at the end of it, she said, whenever we're in the same city, let's get together.
 You know, I just want to spend some time pouring into you.
 And she good true to her word.
 Every time she came into Toronto, she would take me out for a meal.
 She never let me pay.
 If I was out her way, I would let her know, "Hey, I'm coming to BC," or whatever."
 And she'd be like, "Let's get together.
 She'd always pay."
 She was just amazing.
 She had a pivotal impact in my life.
 When I first decided to go into ministry and start itinerating and stuff, she was like,
 "Yes."
 And she just sat down with me and said, "Do this.
 Don't do that.
 Think about doing this."
 She just always believed in me, always was so positive and affirming and all that kind
 of stuff. So yeah, I just I'm so thankful for her. She also published my book.
 So, oh yeah, let's not forget that little chestnut. Yeah. So when I wrote the book, she's so funny
 because I mean, she didn't even know I'd written it. And I was literally praying about who do I
 publish with? I didn't know she had a publishing company. And I'm like, Lord, you know, what do I
 do? And she just phones randomly like, Hey, I was thinking about you today. What's going on in your
 life right now. What, you know, what decisions are you trying to make? Yeah.
 And I was like, Oh dear. So I told her and she said, would you send it to me to
 read it? She said, you don't have to let me publish it. I just, I'd love to read it.
 And I guess she was just getting on a plane as I sent it to her and she called
 me back about four hours later. And she said, I've just read the whole thing.
 And it was 200 and something pages. Right. So she's like, I've just read the whole
 thing on the flight. It would be my honor to publish this, you know, and I'd
 I loved to do a round of edits.
 I mean, she was so encouraging.
  </li><li>'Cause she said, I'd love to do an edit for you
 whether you publish with me or not for free.
 I just believe in the project.
  </li><li>And she did do that, yeah.
 I mean, she was amazing.
 And so--
  </li><li>And she made some key suggestions,
 some really key pivotal changes.
  </li><li>Really good stuff, yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, she said, "Hey, AJ, not everybody
 "has been spiritually parented as well as you have."
 So if you don't define in your book
 what you're looking for in a spiritual parent,
 are going to end up being parented by people that shouldn't be having children.
 So I was like, oh, do you know, Patricia is one of the people of everywhere we've gone.
 And every time we mention her name, we have never heard anything negative about Patricia ever.
 No, I never had.
 Everybody has something good to say about Patricia.
 She's amazing.
 Well, yeah, I mean, we know that. But that's, we still know amazing people that other people find
 fault with. But for her, I've only ever heard great reports, which is wonderful and
 testament to her character.
 Yeah. And I mean, her life, her lifestyle is amazing. Like she doesn't just talk about
 the prophetic, she's out on the streets all the time. Like she's, she is fully living
 a supernatural life. It's just really inspiring.
 Are you ready for my last woman?
 I'm ready for your last woman. That's a weird way of putting it.
 Well, we should, that's a film title.
 Are you ready for my last example of a woman who pivotally impacted my life?
 I am.
 I am.
 I'm ready.
 Speaking of profiteces, yes, it would be remiss to record this episode without talking
 about the incredible impact that Isabelle Alum has had on my life.
 Yes.
 It is a tragedy that more people don't know about Ivan and Isabelle Alum.
 It's true.
 Isabelle Alum is one of my favorite people on the planet.
 She is absolutely adorable.
 One of the most astonishing profiteces I have ever met.
 a life so caught up in the spiritual realm that it's borderline fantasy.
 It is amazing the experience.
 I've had some of the weirdest encounters and she and her husband are the first people I run.
 Who's it? Okay. This happened to me. Can you help me?
 And she's like, Oh, honey, that's totally normal.
 That happens to me all the time. And I'm like, what is your life like?
 But I remember in 2003 meeting Ivan and Isabelle.
 Everybody was excited because Ivan and Isabelle come to the school and they
 profs over the students.
 And honestly, they both gave me a prophetic word that I was like, some
 prophets, they are, I don't know anything.
 Okay.
 There's nothing they said made sense.
 Right.
 And within six months, about 80 to 90% of everything they'd said, because
 here's the thing, it didn't make sense because they were prophesying about
 the future.
 And you're living in the present.
 I'm living in the present.
 I don't know my future.
 Yeah.
 And I was sharing at the belonging that I remember she came, she gave me a word.
 And she was the one that prof, if it wasn't for her and I, then I would
 never have spoken to John and Carol. They prophesied my relationship with John and Carol.
 They prophesied me moving and staying in Canada. They prophesied my relationship with John and
 Carol. They prophesied our ministry. I mean, they literally prophesied emanate six or seven
 years before it ever happened. Right. I mean, they're just astonishing. And I remember her
 saying, I thought it was a figure of speech. She was saying, "Hey, you're going to go through
 the season and in that day you will say," and then she said a couple of sentences. And I
 thought that she was just being metaphorical or, you know, by those words, she was conveying
 a sentiment or a sense of how I'd be feeling. I was shocked that maybe six, seven, eight
 months later, I was journaling with the Lord one day and I was writing out my prayer to
 the Lord and I was writing out these words. I realized, man, those words seemed familiar.
 And so I went back and found the recorded transcript of her word and it was word for
 word verbatim. She prophesied what I was going to say in the future. And so just having
 Ivan and Isabelle as people in my life where I've been able to email them and say, "Hey,
 I'm making this decision. Could you help me?" Or, "Hey, I had this experience with the Lord.
 Could you help me?" "Hey, you know, this is my encounter that I just had with some heavenly
 beings. Could you help me understand that?" Just to have people of that caliber explain
 those things. Plus every time we meet, they give us a prophetic word that's either "senison
 a radical direction" or "confirmed the radical direction" which has changed. So an amazing
 gift to the body of Christ, a tremendous prophet and a wonderful follower of Jesus.
 I think what's amazing is it's very easy to be wowed by their prophetic gift. It's like
 sky high. But what's more impacting than their incredible prophetic gift is the love
 of the exude, the love they have for Jesus
 and the love of Jesus that exudes from them is unbelievable.
  </li><li>I was just thinking about that conference
 a couple of years ago.
 That's probably more than a couple of years ago now
 where Isabel came for the pastor's conference
 and for one session, all she did was hug people.
 She didn't prophesy over them, she just hugged them
 and there was a lineup and she just stood there
 for like six hours and hugged people.
  </li><li>Right. - It was amazing.
  </li><li>That's Isabel. - Yeah.
  </li><li>All right, who's your last person?
 Well, it was hard because I was thinking,
 I thought of this person immediately.
 I mean, I was surrounded in Toronto by women in ministry.
 You know, so, you know, whether it's Sarah
 who's been on the podcast or, you know,
 Kathy or Lindley, they're all people.
 They're all women that were in ministry
 and impacted my life.
 But I was thinking about Jenny Sanford
 and her last name is now a different last name
 that starts with an N that I can't pronounce,
 which is horrible.
  </li><li>Out of girl.
  </li><li>I know.
 But Jenny was one of those people that when you were believing a lie,
 she would call it a lie to your face, you know?
 And nicely, well, if Nicely didn't work, she'd be a little bit more blunt.
 But she just, I think she taught me how to be a friend.
 You know, she just was such a good friend to me and in hard times.
 And yeah, I'm just grateful to her for the way that she just,
 She's a one-on-one minister, but she can also minister to the crowd.
 When I think of Jenny Sanford, who's no longer called that, that's her maiden name,
 I think of one of the most healed-up people I can think. An example of a healed-up person.
 She's amazing.
 She is so whole and so confident in God's love for her.
 Yeah.
 And it's truly a really sort of life.
 I remember somebody saying about her that there's nobody that can do one on one ministry like
 Janie Sandford.
 She's remarkable.
 And she's not in a hurry for you to agree with her.
 She's happy for you to move it, whatever pace God's moving at with you and she'll just
 support you.
 I'm tremendous fun.
 Oh, she's so much fun.
 She's so much fun.
 I get scared when you're around her.
 Because I'm like, what's going to happen?
 She's the person I've gone whitewater rafting with.
 Like I've done all kinds of crazy things.
 She is just, yeah, she's the package deal.
 She's super wise, super fun, just tremendous.
 Yeah, I'm really Mr. I wish she lived closer.
 Maybe you could give her a prophetic word that tells her to move here.
 I think that's called manipulation, but I'm willing to give it a shot.
 All right, I've got some listeners questions and we are way behind our listeners questions.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm so sorry.
 Everybody who sent in a question and we haven't got to, I promise we're going to work through
 a backlog.
 Here's one of them.
 This is from Mariana.
 question for you, A.J. Jones. She says, "Hi, A.J., I'm almost done reading your book,
 Finding Father. It's been amazing. I'm writing to ask you about the heavenly encounter that you
 mentioned you had. You're either a conference or a church meeting and someone who was anointed
 in that area prayed over you and you had an open vision of heaven. Can you tell me which
 conference you went to or who the person was that prayed for you?"
 I can. It wasn't a conference. It was a closed meeting and the person that prayed for me was
 Isabelle Allen. The Isabelle that Allen was referring to a little while ago.
 And it was, she was doing a seminar, her and I, of them were doing a seminar for the church staff
 in Toronto on third heaven encounters, open heaven type stuff. And then she prayed for us all.
 And I had to encounter where the Lord took me to heaven and showed me how much it's stuff.
 So Isabelle Allen.
 I just love her matter of fact, Lee. You say that?
 It's pretty cool.
 Yeah, and then I just have a heavenly revelation, no big deal.
 We'll put a link in the show notes to Ivan and Isabelle, so you can learn more about that.
 Yeah, if they're in your area, you want to go to one of their meetings.
 They're amazing.
 Absolutely.
 If you'd like to ask us a question that we will not answer on air for quite some time,
 I'm kidding.
 If you'd like to ask us a question, we promise we'll do our best to try and answer it.

 It runs full time on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.
 You have the rest of the week off to work.
 You can find out more information.
 You can watch videos.
 You can read testimonies about students who've done it.
 Endorsements from people who've taught in the school.
 If you've got a grace center, all one word,
 dot us slash school.
 Why don't you pray about asking the Lord, Lord,
 would this September be a great time for me
 to go to school a supernatural life
 And reach out to us if you've got any questions about it.
 We'll talk about the school and upcoming episodes,
 but we'd love you to consider applying.
 I know a bunch of people that emailed us already
 asking when they would be open
 and the application is open now.
  </li><li>And in addition to the first year,
 there's also a second year now as well.
 So we have a leadership and the word type year
 that follows the life, supernatural life type year.
 So yeah, go ahead and pray about it
 and just ask the Lord.
 And, you know, if you find that you're getting a yes in your heart,
 but you're thinking about all the obstacles, just ask God to help you with the obstacles.
 He's great at that.
 All of our students have examples of obstacles that came up in their way and God helped them overcome.
 Yeah, amazing.
 And you two could have stories just like that.
 Have a great week.
 Oh, we're done.
 Are we not?
 Okay.
 Do do do do.
 We are.
 I just like the way you said, have a great week.
 Guys, if you don't have a great week, ages, you must have a great week.
 Alright, we love you guys. Okay, we'll be with you next time. Yes. Bye.
