<p> Well good evening mr. Jones good evening hot stuff how are you good.
 Like to welcome all of you listening to podcast number five.
 Sync of the podcast sync to podcast.<br/>
 We have a few technical hitches before he get running tonight.
 Yes we did did you want to share what we had to talk about it hitches.
 Because you accidentally upgraded my machine the latest Mac OS developer version of 10.10.
 I did the way well it's not how i remember it.
 You gave it to me the father's day present early.
 And the goodness of my heart and then i was compelled to upgrade without actually realizing all this is a production machine.
 And in doing so i broke something.<br/>
 I'm not sure how much i'm allowed to say because i'm under a non disclosure agreement with apple but.
 Nevertheless i screwed up.<br/>
 Between the genius of the holy spirit and our producer blake stratton.
 We've got some sort of thing working so let's hope it actually works.
 Yes, let's help indeed.<br/>
 I'm on the topic of.<br/>
 Mac OS 10.10.<br/>
 The good news this week is Apple had the World Wide Developer Conference,
 which we very happy and they released, well, they announced.
 iOS eight and Mac OS 10.10, which they're code naming Yosemite.
 which i can't help but read and pronounce as you's might.
 The reason for that ladies and gentlemen is when we first got married.
 We were ministering in Santa Clara California and when we went there a j.
 Just said to me you know what were there always want to shoot you's might national parks she just called it you's my from the whole time that i knew.
 Deliberately so that i would think it was called you's my person that is called you's might so we go off to California.
 And not realizing I'm<br/>
 sounding exceptionally foolish calling it "yosemite".
 We concup with this pastor and we go for lunch, we minister at this church, we go to this Mexican restaurant.
 And I thought it would be really funny to mispronounce all the words.
 Which we did sometimes anyway, just for fun.
 Yeah, just for fun.<br/>
 So I was like, can I have some quasi-dillas?
 Oh, oh no, maybe I'll have some fajitas.
 I'm not sure.<br/>
 And you could see this pastor like, about to correct me.
 And of course, I think this is very, very funny until I start, you know, he's asking,
 what do you want to do after church?<br/>
 I'm like, well, I'd really like to go see Yo's mic at which point I think he had it.
 It's California pride that it matters.
 Like it's not used to semity.<br/>
 And I was like, no, it's not.<br/>
 I mean, I know the Mexican stuff is not actually pronounced that.
 Google Ac mole is actually Guacamole.<br/>
 But that's the Yo's my story.<br/>
 So to this day, some almost nine years later, every time I see it written down, I want to go,
 Oh yeah, MacOS 10.10,<br/>
 you's might is coming out.<br/>
 Sorry, baby.<br/>
 Yeah, you're completely forget.<br/>
 Not sorry.<br/>
 Top of the list of what's new this week, drumroll.
 Our dear friends,<br/>
 I'm not sure how well his drumroll is gonna work on that.
 Forget it, just imagine a drumroll in your head.
 Our dear friends, Gary and Sarah Morgan,
 had a baby boy.<br/>
 Yes, they did.<br/>
 He's so cute.<br/>
 He is absolutely adorable.<br/>
 Sweet little boy.<br/>
 We're very, very excited to welcome<br/>
 the bias, John, Samuel, Morgan.<br/>
 -Yes. -Right.<br/>
 -D.J. -Round of applause for a quad-ruple barrel name.
 -Woop-woop.<br/>
 -Well, I guess when they're that good, you have to string them all together.
 -Yep.<br/>
 -Yep.<br/>
 -So, as soon as we finish this podcast, we're actually going to go FaceTime with a Morgan.
 -Yay, he's so cute.<br/>
 -He is very cute.<br/>
 -Honestly, babe, if we hadn't had it medically determined that we couldn't have more, he'd
 be enough to make me want to have another one.
 -Which is why we had it medically determined that we would not have any more.
 -That's right.<br/>
 For a moment, such of these.<br/>
 But we could still celebrate his arrival by special cuddles after the podcast.
 Oh, well, I'll take you up on that offer maybe later.
 And that's all we have time for this week.
 Let's go.<br/>
 Let's see.<br/>
 Here we go.<br/>
 What else was awesome this week or new?
 Oh, we went to Kate's kitchen.<br/>
 Is that what it was called?<br/>
 Kate's kitchen?<br/>
 We did.<br/>
 We just walked into this woman's house and we're like, "Are you Kate?
 Yeah, great."<br/>
 We're here.<br/>
 No, it's a little restaurant in<br/>
 Cool Springs area and actually I quite enjoyed it. I liked the way that they decorated it
 And the food that I have it. I mean it wasn't like oh my gosh. It's the best food ever
 But it was good. I would go back. I I liked it
 I'm not sure what the relationship is, but there's a restaurant called Mac and Kate's
 Of Franklin Road, which we've been to and I think it's the same family or same owners
 But yeah, I thought it was quite great. They had some fantastic fruit tea, which is all level, but they had no fish tacos
 They didn't have fish tacos. So basically for restaurant doesn't have fish tacos. I fast at the moment
 I don't so much fast. I just substitute my desire for fish tacos with something else like a fermented cheeseburger
 Which is on living on a moment. So it's not exactly fasting well
 No, it's fasting in the sense that I'm not eating fish tacos which on the topic of which I
 Found some delicious fish tacos at soap a piece also on Franklin Road
 They were superb. In fact, it was so good. I just asked them to bring me a bowl of the
 Baja sauce, which I proceeded to make.
 They were very good.<br/>
 On the topic of food, you did a phenomenal job tonight.
 Thank you.<br/>
 When you tell everybody about your delicious meal.
 Thank you. Well, I have a new cookbook. Well, it's not that new now. I've had it for a
 couple of months, but it's called Against All Grain by Danielle Walker. And it's all
 paleo recipes. So it's grain free and I don't have to change anything.
 Because in the time that we've been married,
 and from meeting people like Dr. Josh Axe
 and our different Dr. Ronson Dykstra,<br/>
 we've progressively progressed a burly.
 I just made up some new words.<br/>
 Progressively.<br/>
 You know understanding more and more about nutrition.
 I've clearly been ignoring most of it,
 but because I've been paying attention a little.
 So paleo is like a hardcore version of gluten freeness.
 It's like gluten free and then going<br/>
 for extra bonus points.<br/>
 It's essentially dairy-free, gluten-free,
 or dairy-free, grain-free, and sugar-free.
</p><ul>
  <li>And you would think that that would be joy-free.
 But based on tonight's meal, it most certainly wasn't.
  </li><li>No, tonight was so good.
 I want to eat it again tomorrow.
  </li><li>It was Asian, what was it?
  </li><li>It was Korean beef noodles bowl.
 But of course the noodles are actually spiralized zucchini.
 which sounds so disgusting and ridiculous,
 but it was amazing. - But it's so good.
  </li><li>And you marinated the meat in a chalet, ginger,
 and oh, it's just absolutely superb.
  </li><li>So nice.
  </li><li>So if you ever come to our house for dinner,
 feel free to request the, whatever it's called,
 the bowl of meat that's delicious.
  </li><li>The delicious bowl of meat,
 no, that might be a lot confusing.
  </li><li>Our topic for this week,
 that I wanted to talk about was actually suggested to us by our four year old.
 A couple of weeks ago, we're driving or I'm driving along.
 My four year old Tia just announces from the back of the car and her cute little
 voice, Daddy, tell me everything you know about the glory.
 And I was like, what?
 So I did my best to talk to her about the glory and realized I don't know much
 about the glory.
 But then she said, "Tell me everything you know about the Holy Spirit, of which I could
 give her much, full or answer."
 And then she announced that she would like to speak in tongues for years old.
 I love the stage she's in right now.
 It just reminds me about being childlike and just sort of, well, if God says we can have
 it, we can have it.
 And so just how do we do that then?
 Rather than how complicated we make things.
 But her questions just started me. I think it's amazing that she's asking questions like that.
 At four, I was asking questions like that in my mid-twenties.
 She's already got a 20-year head start on me. I was thinking about talking about the glory,
 and then I realized I don't actually know that much about the glory, but I do know about his
 presence. I wondered if it would be good to talk about the presence of God.
 because it's our favorite thing.
 Awesome.
 And I guess it's been the forefront of our mind
 because we've been listening to this track
 that Jesse early, one of our worship leaders at Grey Center,
 recorded, she shouldn't even record it.
 It was Monday night, last session of the more conference.
 And David Campbell had finished speaking
 and we didn't know what to do.
 And Mike Western or Blessom got up
 and just started playing some keys.
 And so Jesse got up and just started seeing some ooze and ahs.
 she just got up and she's got this amazing way of just following the Holy Spirit.
 And it's going to sound ridiculous as I describe it, of course,
 and the same way that me describing how good tonight's food was is just pills into comparison
 with you actually getting to eat it. But Jessie gets up and she sings and she's
 accompanied by her phenomenal band and they all just start playing spontaneously, which to me
 is amazing. I don't know how they do it. And the presence of God was just so thick in the room.
 Now, if you're not used to that terminology, we'll explain what we mean about that.
 The presence of God was so thick and it was so profound.
 I ran to the back and asked Marcus, our sound guy, Marcus, please tell me you recorded that,
 of which he absolutely did, which I was so thrilled.
 And so we downloaded it earlier this weekend, and we've just been listening to it in our house
 and just playing it nonstop.
 Or a car, or whatever we are.
 Yeah.
 And it's amazing because you play this track and you can absolutely feel the presence
 of God come in your house.
 And so I don't know how that works.
 But you know, I emailed Jesse said, hey, do you mind if we, I'm sure everybody would like to listen to this? So we put it online yesterday and
 over 300 people have downloaded so far. I don't know how many people have listened to it because you can listen to it or download it. The people we were hosting with email just said you've maxed out
 Your your download space. So we quickly moved it somewhere else. If you look at the show notes, we'll have a link to it. I would really encourage you to just download it and
 And soaked it's incredible. Just just put it on lie in the middle of your floor and just press play and let God
 Yeah, but I want to talk about the presence of God because I remember reading about the presence of God
 And I remember hearing tests of things about people encountering the presence of God
 But in my life at that point I'd never experienced the presence of God. Do you remember the first time you experienced?
 the presence of God
 Yeah, probably. I mean, I guess it would have been
 Maybe 91
 So the first time I was slain in the spirit was 91
 Slain in the spirit
 Overcome by the Lord
 Yeah, that actually was early 92, I guess, but I didn't know what was happening. So I didn't know
 Why I was on the floor why everybody was okay with it
 And what was happening to why nobody was calling an ambulance?
 I couldn't stand primarily and I
 Just started howling laughing. It's just after mark DuPont had prophesied over me, right?
 And I was just getting totally wrecked by God
 But I had no grid for again. Why am I on the floor? Why am I laughing?
 Why why why why you know, you know what's funny about that is I was reading my Bible earlier tonight
 and I came across this verse, which I just tweeted.
 I didn't know that we were going to be talking about this tonight.
 But Isaiah 61 verse 10 says this,
 "I am overwhelmed with joy in the Lord, my God."
 And I was reading that and I was like, well, that has to look like something.
 I wonder what it looks like to be so overwhelmed with joy in the Lord.
 And so here you are talking about rolling around the floor, laughing hysterically.
 Oh, yeah.
 Like my stomach hurt, my face was cramping.
 I mean, I was like 45 minutes of just howling laughing.
 And in my mind, I was like, what on earth are you laughing about?
 But I couldn't stop it.
 Talk to me about what happened after that.
 Like, I don't mean immediately after that in the weeks, months.
 That followed that.
 Well, for me previous to that previous to that encounter, I was still struggling
 with eating disorders.
 I was still struggling with being suicidal and
 After that encounter even though those things weren't prayed over or prayed about right?
 I didn't struggle with them anymore. I haven't struggled with many more. So that was the day that everything changed
 It is remarkable when you encounter the Holy Spirit
 In a way that your brain doesn't understand and he kind of overrules what's going on, you know many people have heard my test of many of I think I was
 I don't know, 2223. And I walked into a church, an environment I'd never experienced. I
 thought it was very, very bizarre. Probably very similar to Grey Center is now the church
 that we attend and passed through it. But I remember encountering the Holy Spirit there.
 And I remember it was different for me. I was prayed for and I too fell over. I didn't
 understand why I fell over. And I remember hitting the floor and I remember it was like
 somebody popped a cork on a champagne bottle that had been shaken up.
 And except what I had the opposite reaction to you, I just wept and wept and
 sobbed and sobbed and sobbed.
 And I remember getting off the floor and going home and thinking, that was the
 weirdest church I've ever been to.
 And honestly, I didn't go home speaking in tongues.
 I didn't go home with rapturous visions.
 I didn't go home having any of these things happened to me.
 But what I do know, what changed for me is everything changed for me.
 You know, that for me was like the ballpark of before and after
 experiencing the Holy Spirit.
 Everything changed in my life for me.
 But subsequent experiences of just being in the presence of God is, you know,
 isn't marked by me sobbing in tears or you laughing hysterically.
 No.
 So I would say weekly we at Grayson and would experience varying degrees
 as the presence of God.
 Yeah, for sure.
 Especially in worship.
 And for me, remember that verse that David talked about?
 You know, we talked about, I've beheld your glory in the temple.
 Like for me, I remember writing home to my parents.
 I went to Toronto, saw everything that happened in Toronto.
 And I was writing to my dad about it.
 And I said, I've sold all I've all I had to get to Toronto, primarily
 because I want to experience the presence of God.
 And you know, that whole place is just absolutely saturated in the presence of God.
 I remember living there as a student for five months and it was just incredible.
 Like everywhere you went, just the presence of God was so thick.
 I don't know it was portable.
 And I didn't know what I was experiencing in Scotland in my little bedroom in Edinburgh
 and Warringer Park Road was also the presence of God.
 Because I remember I'd have times where I would just pray and I would just wait and
 I would soak.
 Like, I would just put on music and lie on the floor.
 And the presence of God, which I didn't know it was that at the time, I do now, would come
 and fill the room so thickly that I'd actually have to ask him to move away because I thought
 I might explode.
 You know, the presence of God was so thick.
 Right.
 That I would just be like, God, you know, I know I spent weeks asking for you to come,
 but now I'm going to have to ask you to leave because I don't think my mortal frame can
 go.
 So the presence of God is highly portable.
 Yeah.
 And I wanted to leave our listeners with some practical steps of how do you host the presence
 of God in your house?
 Okay.
 So what would you say?
 I have a secret list in my house.
 I would say sort of create an environment or a space that's just yours and his.
 And, you know, we have the luxury in this house of being able to have a room that we
 can just make our God room and make that a place where we meet with him.
 But, you know, in times when we've lived in smaller places or I have friends that have
 lived, you know, where they have six children or ten children and they can't do that, they
 have a...
 They're friends with ten children.
 Yeah.
 Are they not heard about cable television?
 Oh dear.
 So they would just have like a chair or, you know, something like that where this is my
 space and what I know when I sit down here, this is where I tune in with God and whatever.
 I had a chair in our and I just have a chair on average go sit there and be with the Lord on the morning
 Mm-hmm. So I didn't even drop to you were mid flow. So that's all I mean
 I think my top tip would be have a place
 You know a place or a space where you know, this is where I go to meet with God and it's it's
 It feels like home for that. Does that make sense? Yeah, I remember being so
 Don't hear me say left brain or something wrong, but I remember being so analytical
 analysis and experience often but heads
 You can often have an experience and get pulled out of the experience because you're trying to analyze the experience right?
 It's a bit like
 You know kissing if I come over there right now and start making out with you if I start
 Processing my head going well, I don't know. This is probably isn't the most
 I wonder if she's in joins and should I move my mouth up and down a bit more and how many germs are sharing right now?
 You know, it's gonna kill the moment, right?
 And so for me, I remember being so analytical just you know reading about people having experiences with the presence of God
 and I remember sitting in my apartment in Edinburgh or my flat in Edinburgh and
 Just waiting for the presence of God to come and not realizing it was there because for example
 I might feel a physical sensation, but I would explain it away
 So I think the easiest thing that helped me was the whole thing of soaking of just
 putting on a CD or
 Playing the track like the one we just talked about and just lying down on the floor
 The reason you don't have to lie down on the floor. You can sit wherever you want
 The reason I like lying down is you can't do anything when you're lying down
 So I would just lie down to say a holy spirit everything she sings and everything she's doing
 Right now. I outsourced my worship to her
 I agree with everything she prays and then I would just be free for me to engage with the holy spirit
 And here's what I would do is whenever I would feel something, I would pay attention to what I was feeling.
 So if I felt my hands tingling, I would acknowledge that.
 If I felt like groaning, I'd often find myself groaning.
 If I felt a breeze begin to blow over me, I'd acknowledge that.
 Sounds crazy.
 But the more attention I gave that, I began to realize that it was the Holy Spirit.
 the more I began to acknowledge and welcome and not analyze or fight or get into tug of war with
 the presence, the more easily the presence of God would come for me.
  </li><li>I think sometimes, like for me, soaking was actually really hard.
  </li><li>Oh, impossibly hard.
  </li><li>You know, and I mean, I would run the list of all the things I could be doing
 that would be more effective use of my time than lying on the floor and
 what I thought was awaiting or hoping that God would show up.
 But I think I know as I reflect back on the level of brokenness I was walking in before
 I started soaking and really letting God just have his way, even though most of the time
 I had no idea what he was doing or if he was doing anything.
 I can honestly say I think probably 80 or 90 percent of the healing I've received in
 my life has come through those times of just lying on the floor and letting God be God.
 I'm experiencing his presence.
 I'm experiencing his presence and sometimes I would feel stuff and sometimes I didn't.
 I could usually tell he was there, but I mean, sometimes I'd ball and sometimes I'd just lie
 there and feel peaceful and it was always different. But God is really good at doing what he does.
 He really is. We've got stories after stories after stories of people being healed just in his
 presence with nobody praying, nobody doing anything, just being in the presence of God.
 I think it's amazing that I moved across the world for the presence of God.
 I heard that he was alive and well and was visiting this church in Toronto.
 And so I just find it so funny that people are doing the same to come to Grace Center.
 We meet people who've moved out of state, moved countries just to come because of experience
 the presence of God and I absolutely love it.
  </li><li>And I think actually Alan,
 that's probably the two different reactions too,
 when God shows up in a place, like your reaction was,
 I wanna move there and I wanna, I want what God's doing
 and my reaction was like I was there and I was offended
 'cause I didn't understand that God would move this way
 and so I wanted to leave.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know, which is, I'm so glad I didn't
 and God arrested me in that moment,
 but I think we have to be so careful to not think
 that we understand God so well that we have him in a box.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And still be pursuing him even in the moments
 where we're like, huh, I didn't know
 it was gonna look like this God,
 but I can identify it's you.
 And so how about I let you be you and I'll just be me?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I don't know.
  </li><li>Well, I wanna pray for you listening.
 Well, I pray that your presence would begin to manifest,
 Lord, just in the lives of everybody who's listening,
 Lord that their houses and cars and rooms of their house and even as they sleep at night,
 Lord, would be places of visitation and habitation that you would just come.
 Lord, I pray for the people who are listening who are leaders of churches that you would
 begin to increase your presence in their churches.
 I'm not asked for a worldwide visitation of your glory.
 Your word is really, really clear that your glory is going to fill the earth.
 But Lord, I just pray that you would start doing that. It would just be absolutely amazing.
 Yeah.
 I think that the kingdom is within us and we can just let it out wherever we go.
 And so I'm asking Lord that you would just come and fill us with your love and fill us
 with your goodness and that you would just teach us to be students of your presence and
 of your glory. And just like my four year old daughter, we would be people who would
 just be like, Holy Spirit, tell us everything you know about the glory and that you would
 increase that on our lives.
 Yeah. Thank you, God.
 If you would like to know more about the presence of God, David Campbell preached an
 amazing message in the last line.
 The more conference will put a link to that in the show notes.
 You can watch half a free on Grace Center's YouTube channel or you can download the MP3
 will put the link in the show notes.
 And also we'll link to Jessie early singing her ooze in ours so you can get in the presence
 of God.
 The one thing I forgot to mention that was super exciting for us.
 This is a little nerdy detail was I'm just on iTunes and I noticed that our podcast jumped
 into the new and noteworthy. What was really funny was we're categorized as
 podcasts, categorized as religion and spirituality, and then in a subcategory of Christianity.
 On the first day, I noticed that we were just tucked away in the Christianity. We were still
 in the new noteworthy section, but buried. Well, in the next couple of days, we're on
 the front page of religion and spirituality. I don't quite know how it works, but I know
 a bunch of people have been leaving feedback. I'm pretty sure that helps. So if you listen to this,
 if this encourages you, if you could do us a favor and go to iTunes and just leave us a review,
 it really, really helps. And I would just love to see us on the front page. I think that would
 be awesome. I would love people to hear more about the presence of God and whatnot.
 The other thing I wanted to mention is this week, we have Ajay's book, Finding Father,
 on sale for the iPad enhanced edition. So if you're an iPad user and you would love a copy of her book,
 we've discounted it globally. So it's available in 30 nations from the item store. If you again,
 follow the link in the show notes, you can get that on sale as well. We'd love you to pick up a
 copy of that. And if you have any questions for us, hit us up on Twitter, Alan and AJ,
 or visit our website, Alan and AJ.com/ask to leave us a question. And we'd love to try and
 answer your questions on the next episode of Keeping Up With The Joneses.
 Do you want to do a shout out to these countries that we saw on the...
 Oh, here's the other crazy thing. We were looking at our stats and we saw countries that...
 What do I say? We saw countries... I didn't even know existed. I'm ignorant, so that's not actually
 that. We don't have a map in the Joneses, old. But we saw a bunch of countries, so we want to say
 high to anybody listening in the following countries. United States. I know right, tricky.
 United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Norway, Brazil, South Africa, Malaysia, the
 Republic of Korea, Cambodia, Shelley, that must be you, we love you. Sweden, the Philippines,
 Netherlands, Nigeria, Italy, France, Finland and Germany. I can't believe that you're
 listening all over the world. We just want to say hi. Thank you for tuning in. And may
 the presence of God hit you in the best possible way this week. Yeah. We will see you same time,
 same place next week. Bye.
