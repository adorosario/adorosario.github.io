<p> I live in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Jones is a j jones yes you how the heck are you?
 I'm okay.<br/>
 How are your green thumbs?<br/>
 Well, we don't know if they're green yet.
 It's undecided whether they're green or black, but we're hoping they're green.
 What I've never heard of a black thumb is that when you have the plague black them is like
 when you can kill any living plant, which has been my history.
 I have had herbs for the last two years.
 The Canadian friends that herbs or herbs?
 Herbs.<br/>
 This is just Americans that do...<br/>
 They drop the perfectly good age.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Do all Americans do?<br/>
 Is it just one part of America?<br/>
 I have no idea, actually.<br/>
 So, yes, you've been in the garden practically all weekend.
 I have.<br/>
 And you've got raised gardens?<br/>
 I do.<br/>
 I spent a couple days waiting them on my own,
 and then I got reinforcements for weeding on Friday and Saturday.
</p><ul>
  <li>I think it's unfair that you say that you spent a couple of days
 weaving them on your own because every time I look at the window,
 you had vast amounts of help from Tia and MJ and Abby.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I can only imagine the assistance they would lend.
  </li><li>They are so helpful that I had to go back through the sections
 that they were weeding in quotation marks and try and salvage it.
  </li><li>They just listened up for you.
 That's all that was. - Sure.
 Let's go with that.
 So let's recap this week.
 You were mostly working on gardens towards the end of this week.
 What was at the beginning of this week?
 Well, Lyle Phillips spoke at Emmonit.
 I love that guy.
 He's lovely. I love when he preaches.
 Every time Lyle speaks, I feel something in my heart.
 Conviction, encouragement, shame, condemnation,
 just kidding.
 Only good stuff. I love when Lyle ministers.
 And you spoke on the fivefold?
 It did. I'd tell him the fivefold ministry at SoSell this week,
 which is a fasting topic because it's brand new to me, but I enjoyed doing that.
 And then the rest of the week was just normal meetings and better meetings.
 Yep.
 And then we had Easter party for the kids on Saturday.
 Yep.
 Easter egg hunt.
 I told you my tactics.
 Yes, you did.
 You told her your keys to success, which I don't want to repeat on the podcast because
 then other parents will pass it on.
 Right.
 And then their kids are going to do what our kid does and then we won't get all the eggs.
 Well, then it will get nasty.
 It'll turn into fight club cage fighting.
 Well, I thought to get, you know what, if they get in your way, just cut them,
 blow them down.
 And then we had dinner at Vuey's, didn't we?
 You love that place.
 I do.
 I do.
 I do.
 We introduced some Francifian and Miesford.
 Yep.
 And then this morning, Easter service with naptisms plus incredible worship.
 Oh, I love that.
 Plus weeping.
 Yes.
 I cried in worship.
 It was amazing.
 Oh, it was amazing.
 It was very, very good.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Our topic for this week is I thought we talked on it before,
 but I did a quick search and we had not.
 You're kidding me.
 No.
 Are you sure?
 Yeah, for something that we do on a regular basis,
 you would have thought we've talked about it by now.
 I would have.
 I know, but we haven't.
 So let's.
 OK.
 All right.
 Confrontation.
 Confrontation.
 I remember Danny Silk teaching on the culture of honor, which everybody loves.
 And he was saying that a culture of honor can't exist without a culture of
 confrontation.
 Yes.
 Because if all I do is tell everybody in my community, they're awesome.
 I never actually helped them grow, which is why confrontation is so helpful.
 Now, confrontation has had a terrible reputation.
 Well, and that's because people think that confrontation means conflict.
 And do you think that's because historically the two look the same?
 As in, if you don't know how to confront well, do you just come across as
 combative and yes, because I think people get super nervous when they need to
 actually confront. And sometimes because of that, the defensiveness makes it into something
 it doesn't need to be.
 Right. Whereas what we found is that confrontation is simply loving someone enough to point out
 where their behavior is causing friction, which is removing favor. It's bringing to the surface
 anything that is degrading the strength of a connection in relationship. I think it's funny
 that a lot of people in relationships will put up with pain because they don't want to rock the
 boat, so to speak. Yeah, it's amazing to put up with it for years and years and years.
 And so my first question when we find that dynamic happening in a relationship is,
 what sort of relationship do you have? Right. And is that the one that you want?
 And aren't you worth more than that? Yeah, like, why would you want to be part of a relationship
 that you have no voice in right it's worthy of asking like why are so many people volunteering
 for poor relational health i don't know except that most people don't actually like
 uh confrontation or conflict or rock in the boat so we'd rather have low grade relationship
 than no relationship is that what it is well which is funny because you're actually not having a
 real relationship if you're not willing to come confront in the first place right it's pretty
 fraudulent. That's alien to me. I know, darling. God bless you. Chris Valton, as is great line,
 says, "What you don't confront, you condone." When we refuse to confront that which is bothering us,
 we're basically training other people how to treat us. That's correct. What that means is the
 longer that you leave the confrontation, the heavier the ship becomes that you're trying to turn.
 That's a weird metaphor.
 Well, give an example.
 So for example, if I've been married to you for seven years
 and then after seven years say, hey, babe,
 can I bring someone to your attention?
 Like I just, I hate toast for breakfast
 and every morning you make toast for me.
 And I'm just wondering why you would make toast for me.
 And, you know, I just, everyone,
 I don't want to get up and eat breakfast.
 The first question you should ask is,
 Why didn't you tell me that day one
 as opposed to seven years in?
 Right.
 And I was like, oh, I don't know.
 I just didn't want to say anything.
 And I want to upset you.
 And you're trying to be a good wife.
 And now that's obviously a frivolous example.
 But if I'm bringing it up after seven years,
 you've got every right to go,
 is this a recent development or is this a real issue?
 So our encouragement is to confront as quickly as possible.
  </li><li>Yeah. And again, even that example is a great example
 of why confrontation is a huge C-word
 in some people's heads.
 And we're talking about something that's a small C-word.
 It's just being able to live powerfully communicating
 when something has actually bothered you,
 so that doesn't have to grow into a beast.
  </li><li>Right, can you imagine what our marriage would be like
 if both of us were too scared to tell the other person
 how we were feeling?
  </li><li>Quieter.
 (laughs)
 Too shade.
 Really the quality of our relationship.
  </li><li>Would be dreadful.
  </li><li>Right, it's a relationship made up of two people
 trying to please the other person
 without ever getting any feedback
 whether they're efforts for working or not.
 here's the thing with both of us, we know how the other person is feeling because we also know that if you're doing something so setting to the other one, you're going to hear about it.
 And that's the irony of the whole thing.
 Right.
 We don't want to confront with our words, but we'll use nonverbal communication that subtly by osmosis.
 We hope the other person picks up change your behavior, change your behavior, which is so passive behavior else to have you in your sleep.
 Look, chapter 17.
 This is Jesus in his relationship model.
 He says, watch yourselves.
 There's a nice starter.
 If your brother or your sister sins against you,
 rebuke them and if they repent, forgive them.
 So evangelicals are great at focusing on their repent
 and forgive part, but I don't think I've ever heard anybody
 teach on the rebuke part.
 Like we've just glossed over that part.
 Like until Dan Farrelly came and taught this passage to us,
 we were like, oh, Jesus does say rebuke.
 Rebuke is basically going and confronting.
 Right. And so we like to think about the repenting and forgiving because that can be done in private,
 but the rebuking part, it means you actually go to somebody and say, "Hey, I can't give you
 some feedback," or, "Hey, I felt really upset," or, "I felt really hurt when you did," or, "Hey,
 could I just tell you I haven't experienced any of that sort of stuff?" Right.
 And it requires exceptional bravery. But again, we want to be in relationships where we're fostering
 this open environment where people can give us the feedback we so very much need to hear.
 Right. And again, if you're doing, if you're doing that confrontation when things start happening,
 it's a much lighter, nicer conversation than if you allow something to go on and on and on to
 the point where now you feel, I don't know, defiled or super angry or whatever. And now you're not
 having a nice, like conversation. Now you're having a full on conflict, but it would have been
 possible to just have a nice, you know, confrontation and clear communication in the beginning.
 Yeah, it's amazing how many people will sacrifice short-term pain, thinking is not going to blow up in their face.
 Right. If I can avoid the pain of confronting you, I'm sure it will all work out, we say, in imagination.
 But a lot of people just do put up, put up, put up, blow up.
 Sure. Not pretty.
 Well, I think that's probably the reason the divorce rate is so high.
 Well, thanks. Let's talk about that. Just kidding.
 OK.
 So, AJ Jones, how do you confront?
 So there's three steps.
 You connect first, then you ask questions, and then you present your observation of the problem.
 That sounds way too complex. Let's break down the steps. So when you say connect first, talk to me
 about this connecting thing. Well, presumably you're actually confronting this person because you
 want to maintain relationships. So you have some sort of relationship to maintain. So you're either
 friends or their spouse or their child or etc. So you just want to genuinely connect
 with them and let them know that you want to talk to them about something and you want
 their opinion on it.
 Right. And this step isn't like a buffer or like a warm up, you know, to check the temperature
 of the pool or anything. You're genuinely connecting. Be it who has said that you can't
 drive a three ton truck of correction over a one ton bridge of relationship.
 Right.
 So, you know, make sure there's enough relational equity there, but yeah, you're connecting
 first. You're, you're, you're basically asking for their opinion on your opinion.
 Like later on, that's what the confrontation is.
 And it also establishes some vulnerability, doesn't it?
 Right.
 So I think it's good.
 So that's number one.
 Connect first.
 Number two, you're asking questions.
 Why do we do that?
 Well, you're kind of asking their permission to speak into an area of
 their life or to speak into situation that's happened that's actually affecting both of you.
 Right. We've got our friend, Betsy Kildra, who's got this great line. She's the sweetest
 can be and as sharp as can be. And she says, "If I saw something hurting you,
 would you want me to tell you about it? I mean, how are you going to say no to that?"
 Right. Right.
 But basically, yeah, when you ask questions, you're genuinely inviting somebody else into the
 discussion. Again, these aren't party tricks, these aren't like control sales techniques.
 You're genuinely wanting permission. So I often use things like, hey,
 could you help me understand? Like that's my that's a golden line. Can you help me understand
 why you thought it was a great idea to go away as a boyfriend and girlfriend for the weekend
 together? Like, can you help me understand? Like, when you post that to Instagram, are you aware
 of like what that's doing or could you clarify for me like last time what we saw each other?
 It felt like I might have hurt you. You felt really withdrawn. Am I out to lunch on that?
 Again, you're just you're asking questions. Right. And then the last step is you just present an
 observation of the problem. Right. You're basically saying, Hey, this is how I fell. Am I out to
 lunch or the classic? Hey, can I tell you how I experienced you? Like, Oh, you need to be really
 brave to say yes to that one. But here's the thing, when we're doing this confrontation,
 more often than not, we're confronting behavior.
 Right. Not their character or their person.
 But most times the person receiving it feels like we're judging their motive or their
 character or something else. So you have to work overtime. And the phrase that I tend
 to use is, I want to talk about some behavior that is absolutely not in line with what I
 I know your heart to be.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I'm not sure if you know that you're doing this.
  </li><li>And that's actually why we're confronting them, isn't it?
 Because it isn't in line with who we know them to be.
  </li><li>So it causes confusion or friction.
  </li><li>Right, 'cause you're not gonna confront somebody
 who's doing behavior that you know it actually is who they are
 because you already know that about them.
  </li><li>Right, but I think of the benefit I've had when you
 and some of my close friends and our leaders in our lives
 have said to me, "Hey, Alan, are you aware
 that you come across like this?"
 And of course I'm not aware
 that I'm going to cross like this because if I did, I would modify my behavior.
 So it's really helpful input.
 Um, and that's basically it.
 You're connecting, you're asking questions, you're presenting an observation, the problem.
 The goal is not to think I have to win.
 You win by opening your mouth in love.
 You do not win by them falling at your feet, saying, Oh, would you please forgive me?
 Because sometimes people won't be able to see it and are either thinking, no, I don't
 that or, "Hey, I need to go away and pray about it," or, "But the win is you risking the relationship
 you have for one that might be better." One of the verses I pray often, Ephesians 4-32, be kind
 and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other just as in Christ God forgave you.
 Like smiling, remembering that love is the goal, all of that does wonders at lowering the anxiety
 through the whole process.
 Right.
 So when is a bad time to confront?
 Tuesdays.
 Yeah.
 No.
 So you chose it like four.
 We have this saying in our community
 that a terrible time to pretty much do anything,
 but especially any level of confrontation
 is when you're in a state of halt, H-A-L-T.
 That stands for hungry, angry, lonely, tired.
 Right.
 You're never going to be at your best
 when you're in one of those four things.
  </li><li>Right, so even the most well-planned confrontation,
 if you were in halt, is probably not gonna go well.
  </li><li>Abort, abort, abort.
  </li><li>Abort exactly, wait a day, get some sleep,
 get some food, get some perspective, and then come back.
  </li><li>And the other thing is, like for example,
 on Saturday night, we went out for some dinner
 with our friends, we were not going out to confront,
 we're going to hang out, but I realized
 we'd worked out in the yard all afternoon,
 I get in the car and I'm thinking,
 I have no energy to connect with people I love.
 So I recognized, oh, I'm in the hungry stage.
 Again, this isn't confrontation, this is just friendship.
 And I just said to them, guys, I'm so sorry.
 If I seem withdrawn, I promise you,
 as soon as I eat something, I'll be much better.
 And right enough, as soon as I had some food in me,
 I was like, oh, and I'm back.
  </li><li>And they had their taser ready
 in case that wasn't the case.
  </li><li>Exactly, but if that's you on a good day,
 hungry not being able to perform
 Imagine throwing in the anxiety of having to do a confrontation.
 So just say no to that.
 Just say no.
 When is a good time to confront?
 I'm not sure there's ever a good time to confront.
 I mean, we could make excuses forever to not bring confrontation.
 Absolutely.
 So I think you have to just choose a time in confront.
 Right. And often our leaders, you know, when we're setting them up, like, and we're training
 them how to confront, we're saying, okay, you're going to do that.
 How was it?
 And come back and they're like, you know, it just didn't seem like a good time.
 And we encourage them like, hey, there's never a good time.
 You just want to get out there and do it.
 Now, obviously, if somebody's going through crisis or loss, not a good time to confront.
 But the genuinely bad times to confront are fewer than you would actually think.
 Right.
 And our encouragement to people is it's a skill you learn.
 The reason you don't want to do it is you're not practiced at it.
 And the only way to get practiced at it is to do it.
 Right.
 And remember that kindness is really vital in the process.
 So you need to actually smile.
 It lowers the anxiety in the room.
 And it helps people to realize,
 hey, you're not mad at me.
 You're actually loving me enough to bring up something
 that can be fixed.
 'Cause God in the midst of anything can bring resolution.
  </li><li>Absolutely, absolutely.
 So here's our encouragement for you this week.
 Ask the Lord about any friction in your relationships.
 So just do a relationship audit with the Holy Spirit.
 And if you were being listened to this,
 probably people have already come to mind.
 probably thinking, "Oh yeah, I do need to confront that person." And so ask the Lord,
 like when is a good time to confront? Come up with a game plan, think about our three-step
 process, connecting, asking questions, presenting an observation of the problem, and then action
 the game plan. It's honestly going to produce incredible results in your relationships.
 Now next week, we're going to talk to you about how to receive confrontation, a task
 that's just as vital and possibly harder than initiating confrontation. So join us next
 week for part two of this topic.
