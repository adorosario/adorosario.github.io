<p> Hi, hello AJ Jones. How are you? I am fantastic
 Excellent in fact, I'm spectacular you are spectacular. Mm-hmm. How was your week?
 Good. I shall already know how your week was because it was amazing. It was
 Fantabulous it was a week filled with meeting with people it was it started meeting with lots of people and ended with a killer conference it did so
 You got let's let's get the stuff that we did that wasn't a conference out with away right Monday
 Tuesday met with lots of people, had fun, got to know some new people, that sort of thing.
 You went to the belonging Tuesday night?
 I went to the belonging on Tuesday night, which was great.
 And the belonging is a gathering.<br/>
 It's a church that meets on Tuesday nights, usually at Rocket Town.
 Up in Nashville.<br/>
 Up in Nashville.<br/>
 And it looks like a primarily young adult.
 And it is led by two amazing people.<br/>
 Yes, Henry and Alex Seeley.<br/>
 From Australia.<br/>
 Yes, they have fantastic accents.<br/>
 You can get away with so much with accents.
 Right.<br/>
 I say that from experience.<br/>
 So it was great.<br/>
 We went once before.<br/>
 Couldn't get a sitter Tuesday night,<br/>
 so I just went on my own.<br/>
 And it was super good.<br/>
 I enjoyed seeing Henry doing what he does,
 which is lead worship and Alex preach,
 because the last time we went, I think Henry was speaking
 and somebody else was leading worship.
 And so it was fun to see them in their element as it were.
 It's also nice for us to go to a church service where we have no responsibilities.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I love that part.<br/>
 That was great.<br/>
 Good.<br/>
 You got your hair done.<br/>
 You look amazing.<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 I got hers did.<br/>
 Miranda, get back in your cell.<br/>
 Her's did.<br/>
 Um, yes, I cut off like a foot, which is.
 Wait, what now?<br/>
 I cut off almost a foot of hair.<br/>
 I think.<br/>
 Oh, yeah.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Maybe not a, not quite a foot, but close to it's short.
 I posted a picture of you earlier speaking on Sunday, which we'll talk about in a second.
 And everyone was like, wait, you went blonde.
 You look really blonde in that photo, to be fair.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah, you put some sort of filter on it.
  </li><li>What?
  </li><li>I am blonder than I was though, for sure.
 But I like to do that in the summer anyway.
 It makes me feel fancy.
  </li><li>Talk about your message this morning.
  </li><li>I spoke on that you're designed for encounter,
 you're designed for experience.
 So it was fun because during the more conference,
 having Graham here speaking and stuff,
 stuff. He spent some time referencing the importance of experience, which was fun for
 me because I had been working on that sermon for the last week or so. And so I'd already
 put together most of it. So I just felt like, oh, good. We're, you know, flowing in the
 same direction. And it's not going to be a hard right turn on Sunday morning in some
 other direction, which is nice.
 My favorite part of your message was you somehow managed to weave in the necessity of
 eating a hundred layer donut which I got to finish.
  </li><li>Yes, yes you did.
 On both services really.
  </li><li>Praise him.
  </li><li>But then I also got some that I could cut up
 and give away because I was trying to give people
 the example of would you rather look at a picture
 'cause I had pictures up on the screen of them
 or listen to me talk about my experience
 with a hundred layer donut
 or would you rather actually have your own experience
 sort of using the analogy.
 So it's quite fun.
 And Isaac is a king.
 Isaac's the guy that makes them the baker, Isaac makes.
 And even though his wife was in labor, he made me doughnuts.
 Tell them about your very sensitive email that you sent this morning.
 Text.
 I felt-- I deliberated for half an hour in the shower, like, do I send a text?
 Because the night before they'd sent something saying how dilated she was and how
 faced and whatever.
 And I thought, gosh, like those--
 She pointed out that Isaac's wife, Stephanie, is ready to give birth any moment.
 Yes, she's full term and it's their fifth child.
 And so she sent out this text saying, basically,
 it's all starting to happen.
 I'm having contractions and all that kind of stuff.
 And so I didn't finish my keynote presentation
 because I thought, well, it's possible that I'm
 going to have to use something else as my example of experience.
 So in the morning, we still hadn't heard anything.
 and I'm thinking, if there's a baby,
 I think we would have heard.
 So in the shower, I was just like,
 I don't know whether to text or not,
 text is so insensitive, like, hey,
 you might be pushing out a baby right now,
 but do you have my donuts?
  </li><li>Which is pretty much what you said.
  </li><li>No, it is not.
 I was like, hey, anyway,
 it was a much nicer version of that.
 Like, it's totally fine if this isn't gonna work today.
 I know what's going on, but Isaac is a king
 and he got me these gorgeous,
 I mean, they were stunning.
 I mean, when I held them up in front of the people,
 you could see them start to salivate.
  </li><li>I'm not sure if we could get away with this,
 but I'd like to have communion with 100 layer donuts
 and Mexican Coke.
  </li><li>Yes, at one point, when I was speaking,
 I was like, yeah, we thought about saying,
 "Hey guys, do you want one of these?
 "Look under your seat."
 You know, like Oprah or one of those talk shows, but--
  </li><li>You know what was funny was one of our former students,
 students Josh, he tweeted this,
 he was watching live at home.
 When you started talking about donuts, he said out loud, "Oh God, please don't let this be the
 church service where they do an Oprah." And I'm missing out on a donut. And then you crack that
 joke so he was clearly tuned into the Holy Spirit. Yeah. Yeah, I had fun this morning. It was super
 fun. And then talking of super fun at church, let's talk briefly about the more conference.
 so good. I think I'm going to need to process for quite a while before I can really
 talk about it or figure out what I want to say. But Graham's one of those people you,
 well, for me, I give up taking notes really early and I just try and listen and get what I can get
 that day realizing I'm going to need to buy the download. I managed to take notes for all four
 sessions, but it just about killed me. Like mentally, I had a headache in the best possible
 sense of the word because he's saying stuff and you're thinking, "Right, okay, well, how
 does that apply here, here?" You know, I instantly go to ramifications of all the things. And
 it was amazing revelation. It was so good. And he's long been one of my favorite speakers
 ever. So told Joy to have him back in her house. He was here five years ago. And then
 super fun for us is we got to host them. So we got to spend lots of time with them.
 Yeah, that was probably my favorite part. Like, I mean, I loved listening to him teach,
 but I love just being able to hang out with them. There's just normal and real and approachable
 and funny. They like good food. They like good food. You know, we went and just hung out for
 several hours at the factory and just drank coffee and had donuts and acai bowls and just
 talked and it was so fun.
 That's really good to ask.
 I'm going to ask you another question.
 Yeah.
 So yeah, it was amazing.
 If you were at the conference, you already know what we're talking about.
 If you missed the conference, you can download the sessions that must have
 more.com, all four of Graham's teaching sessions.
 And I would highly recommend you get all four of them because he's a really
 skillful teacher.
 He led a great foundation and then built precept upon precepts.
 So yeah, I listened to them in order.
 Yeah, for sure.
 Um, are the healthsers on those recordings or no, it's just the teaching just the teaching.
 But I mean, that totally makes sense.
 Yeah.
 Copyright and stuff.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Um, because the healthsers were fantastic, weren't they?
 They were.
 It was fun bringing in not just worship leaders, but their whole team.
 Yeah.
 Cause they're a family.
 They all, you know, play together.
 It was obvious that they all live together, don't they?
 Like in one sort of area or something.
 I'm not entirely sure, but I think they all live on something called the farm.
 That's a CIA training ground.
 Not that far.
 So they're over.
 Wow.
 Who knew we can set a whole new room.
 So the houses are actually the people that alias is.
 I wondered what he was hiding that in that beard.
 Yes.
 That's a very good question.
 Anyway, they were exceptional.
 They were just astonishing.
 We just want to take a moment to thank everybody who came at the conference.
 And especially all our volunteers and our incredible staff that were
 so hard to provide what we hope was an incredible experience for everybody who attended.
 Baby, I need to make an apology to our listeners.
 Yes.
 Last week on the podcast, I said this week we'd be talking about destiny.
 Liar.
 Depends on fire. But what I realized is my brain is so frazzled from listening to a
 weekend towards the teaching on destiny and other things.
 Yeah.
 But I'm going to push pause on that and we'll come back to that another time.
 Yeah.
 What I want to talk about this week is I realized that today is our 52nd episode.
 So cool.
 Which means we've been podcasting officially for a year.
 Amazing.
 We're podcasting.
 I can't believe it.
 We are.
 Do you remember how we got started?
 Yeah, you said, "Hey, baby, I want to do something called a podcast."
 And I said, "What's that?"
 And I said, "Remember how you walk in and I'm listening to people talking to each other."
 And you're like, "Why are you even listening to this?
 That's a podcast."
 Will you also use some sort of feature where it speeds the people up?
 Right.
 So to me, it feels so stressful to hear somebody talk that fast that I just want to run.
 If you listen to podcasts, I would highly recommend you download a podcast app for your
 iPhone called Overcast. It's an excellent podcast client. And it has this thing called Smart Speed
 where it speeds up. You can either speed it up like up to two times and there's a person who
 I have these runners and ribs, I mean, that's not what she's talking about.
 It has a smart speed thing which automatically speeds up the flow and the rhythm of the speaker,
 which drives AJ nuts, but I love it because it takes less time.
 And I'm always in a strive to be more efficient in everything I do.
 Okay.
 But I thought you listened to podcasts like chill and have a moment to use that.
 Well, you can. Yeah. But initially, I think when we started, we talked about what did we want
 a podcast to look like and I'm not sure we were convinced it would even work.
 No, I didn't think so. I was like, first of all, what are we going to talk about every week?
 And second of all, who's going to want to listen?
 And they are valid questions. But the reason I thought people might listen
 is because I listen to podcasts just like this.
 So we'll get like the geek people that will listen.
 No, no, no. What I mean by that is I have, you know, the podcasts I listen to are not
 sermons because I live in that world and I have a lot of teaching coming my way.
 The podcasts I listen to are basically people sitting around talking about things that are
 interesting to me. And the podcasts I listen to are by people I don't even know. So I have no
 connection with these people other than that I listen to their podcasts each week. And I've grown
 super, it sounds ridiculous, but I've grown in tremendous fondness for these people I've never
 met and may never meet. And so I know about their lives, I know about their kids, I know about their
 preferences. I know about the sense of humor. And I just thought, gosh, I really, really love
 listening to this nerdy podcast of three guys talking about, you know, Apple products and cars,
 even though I don't know anything about cars. So what I learned was it wasn't necessarily the
 topic. It was the personalities and the Lord knows we have enough personality between the two of us.
 So I thought we'd probably be okay on that. But like any time you step out and do something new,
 you're stuck with that horrible thought in the back of your head, which is like, is anybody
 even going to like this. It's like, is this good? Our friend Lyle Phillips, who's a pastor
 of Iris National in town and been on the show before, he put on Instagram this week, he said,
 "creativity requires boldness." And we certainly went through that, didn't we?
 Yeah, for sure. Because again, you're like, "Is this going to be good?" Right. I mean,
 even a year in, I'm still kind of surprised that we do this. Not, you know, I enjoy it actually now.
 to begin with I used to just get kind of stressed because I thought oh you know I
 don't I don't know how to do this other than just sit here and be us but the
 feedback that we most often receive from people which really blesses my heart is
 people say it's like we're at your house with you just chilling out and that was
 always our goal yes because when you have conversations with friends over
 dinner they're not always interesting no right there you know there it's not
 stuff you'd write down and then publish for everybody to read, but you enjoy the flow of conversation.
 Right.
 And I think, well, I know, because that's what people tell us that our listeners get that
 from us.
 Yeah, for sure.
 Do you remember that time that we had to record the podcast four times?
 Good times.
 Yes, we've learned a lot, haven't we?
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah, the mics need to be on.
 Who knew?
 And then you actually have to press record.
 Right.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah. (laughs)
  </li><li>Yeah, when we started, we basically
 bought a couple of mics,
 and mics down some pop filters.
  </li><li>Pop filters.
  </li><li>Ah, stop.
 We don't want plosives.
  </li><li>Oh, I don't even know what plosives are,
 but that sounds lovely.
 I'll have some milk and two plosives please.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Plosives are that sound.
  </li><li>Right. - Which is what
 the pop filter's supposed to stop.
  </li><li>Okay.
 So you deliberately go, you're going to be annoying to everybody who's listening to this.
 Sorry.
 I'm sorry for my plosive nature.
 So yeah, we bought stuff, not even sure if we would stick with it, whether it would fit
 into our schedule, whether people would even like it.
 But you know, we've found tremendous fun recording it, haven't we?
 Yes.
 I think it's funny that you said whether it would fit into our schedule because sometimes
 like this evening, we're recording close to midnight.
 You can make anything, you can make anything, you can schedule it, you're like, yeah, when
 I am best time to record a podcast.
 What I mean by that is you're absolutely right, of course, whatever is important, you'll make
 room for.
 And that's, you know, it's not like we had nothing else to do before we started recording
 a podcast, but we're like, is this something that God wants us to do?
 Is this something of value?
 Is this going to help the kingdom?
 And when we prayed about it, we felt that the Lord said, yeah, do it.
 Yes.
 And we do have tremendous fun.
 We do.
 It's more fun to do this and clean my house.
 This is why my house looks weird, does you believe in podcast?
 You said yes to podcasting and no to a tidy.
 Let's face facts.
 Our house wasn't tidy before we started podcasting.
 Wow.
 No.
 You know what's been surprising?
 Is it actually worked?
 What?
 Podcasting.
 It did.
 We didn't.
 It did.
 It does.
 It does end that we record it every week and then people listen to every week.
 Yes.
 Our difficulty is, and this isn't unique to our podcast.
 This is unique to podcasting.
 It's actually quite difficult to determine how many listeners you have to an accurate level.
 If only we can make the podcast, your tag people or something so we could count them.
 It's coming next year.
 No, but in all seriousness, you know, we've got a few bits of data that we can look at.
 one is our subscriber count. So that's the number of people who subscribe to the show.
 And we have just at the start of this year tipped over 2000 individual subscribers a month.
 The problem with that is subscribers don't necessarily mean listeners.
 Okay.
 Because let's say for example, your cousin
 subscribes to the podcast.
 Yes, they do.
 I know, but let me finish this sentence.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 So let's say she subscribes on her iPhone.
 Yes.
 and then she subscribes on her iMac at home and then she also subscribes on her iPad.
 That's three subscriptions out with those 2,000 odd subscriptions, but actually only one listener.
 So she's one person that's of two or three minds?
 No, she's one person with two or three subscriptions.
 So you can automatically say, oh, we have like, you know, 2,300 subscribers, therefore we have 2,300 listeners.
 So it depends on how many devices people have.
 Well, and then it also depends on people actually choosing to listen to the podcast via the
 subscription because in the conversations I've had with people just informally, I'm amazed
 to find out that people actually listen to our podcast via the website.
 As in, they go to our website, lnaj.com, and then they click play on the button and just
 listen to the podcast streaming over the web.
 It's very, very common, but I don't realize people did that.
 So then we can look at the number of stats and number hits that we have on our podcast
 pages and we've served over 2,000 podcasts in the last two weeks.
 So you put some rough numbers together and it seems like we have a couple of thousand
 listeners from around the world and then we get emails from people around the world,
 which is great.
 It's just so bizarre.
 It's so bizarre because here we are, we're in our room each week and we're just rambling
 and then we uploaded the server, send it out.
 And then you guys are very sweet to listen to it and tweet about it.
 You know I want to do this week.
 What?
 I wanted to get to know our listeners a little bit better.
 Okay.
 Because they know us really well, but we don't really know who is listening.
 Very true.
 Except for, you know, some faceless thousands of people.
 High faceless thousands of people.
 Here's what to do.
 Head over to if you'd like to, this would bless us immensely.
 If you go to allen and AJ.com, you'll see right there on the main page, allen, alyn and
 aj.com. If you go there,
 you spell a J people have asked before just saying no silent
 letters just as it's I've had people write me cards that say
 a J a Y. Don't make it tricky. It's two letters. I have an
 actual name.
 Yeah, if you go to Alan and a J.com, you'll find a link
 there because we've prepared a little get to know you part of
 the site because we genuinely want to hear from you.
 Maybe it's just me, but I absolutely love filling in surveys.
 I do.
 You're the one that they make them for then?
 No, no, no.
 Here's the thing though.
 I hate filling in bad surveys.
 Like poorly designed surveys where you have to spend time going, what do you even mean
 by the question?
 And then the answers to give you don't make any sense.
 So here's what I've spent this evening doing.
 I've created a beautiful looking survey.
 Of course you did.
 over to allenaj.com. Click on the button to fill out our survey. It's completely anonymous
 if you would like it to be. But we love feedback. We would love to hear from you. We'd love
 to hear from where you're from, how long you've been listening, that sort of stuff. And our
 way of saying thanks for you doing that is we have a bunch of stuff that we'd love to give away.
 And so like I said, you can fill in the survey completely anonymously. We'll never know who sent
 it. But if you would like to be entered in a draw to win some books and teaching materials and
 and a little poster that I'm gonna talk about in a second.
 Just leave us your email at the end of the survey
 and then at random we'll select some people
 and give away some stuff.
 We're gonna ahead and create a poster.
 It's a 20 inch by 30 inch poster
 featuring all the artwork of all the podcasts of this year.
 It's beautiful, it's stunning.
 We're looking forward to giving that away.
 I cannot believe that we've been podcasting for a year.
 Thank you so much dear listeners
 for joining us on this journey.
 Fill in that feedback form. We would love to make year two even even better. And more than that,
 we'd love to get to know you. We'd love to learn more about our audience. And we're looking forward
 to hearing your feedback. AJ Jones, any closing thoughts for this week?
 No, we made it through a whole year of podcasting. Very cool. I'm looking forward to next year,
 see what it looks like. You know, next year starts next week.
 Yeah, time moves so fast nowadays, years a week.
 All right, good night from Alan and good night from Old Mrs. AJ.
 Good night, as MJ would say. Goodbye, peoples.
