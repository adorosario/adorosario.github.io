<p> I'll live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Mosey.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 I'm good.<br/>
 We still haven't recorded a new song for question time.
 Well, to be honest, I hadn't actually factored in that we would be doing that given our tiny
 amount of talent.<br/>
 Don't worry.<br/>
 Don't worry.<br/>
 I'll work on it for you and just get it all sorted out.
 Be still my beating heart.<br/>
 Let's talk about this week, which can be basically condensed into two things.
 Yes.<br/>
 One, packing, yes, and two meeting with people.
 It's true.<br/>
 Let's talk about packing.<br/>
 Packing.<br/>
 Packing is if you guys could see the room that we're recording in right now.
 Honestly, it's it's a lot of work.<br/>
 Well, the thing is we've got people coming on Friday and Saturday to help us
 low dollar stuff into a storage pot, that's right.
 But in order for that to work smoothly, we first have to put
 everything in packing boxes so that we can play packing
 Tetris easier.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And that's proving to be a lot of work.
 It's proving to be interesting.<br/>
 And then we have a lot of items that don't fit in boxes easily
 enough.<br/>
 And I just want to throw them out.<br/>
 I don't want to throw our children out, but I like to be really need this rocking chair.
 It doesn't fit in a box.<br/>
 Let's get rid of it.<br/>
 And I'm like, no, you can't throw out all of our stuff because it doesn't fit in a box.
 The trickiest thing is packing stuff that you actually need.
 Yes.<br/>
 Cindy informed me today that, you know, because I've brought the kitchen down to the bare
 minimum of things that I need in a kitchen to be able to function.
 She said that she doesn't even have all those things in her kitchen normally without
 half of our kitchen or three quarters of the kitchen back.
 Well, to be honest, you are a kitchen.
 I don't know what you are.<br/>
 What's the, what's the thing that you are with the kitchen?
 Um, you are to kitchen utensils as I am to apps.
 Yes, or gadgets, kitchen gadgets.<br/>
 Well, the funny thing is we've packed away a lot of our home automation stuff.
 So I'm going around like a caveman at night turning lights off.
 It's so bizarre.<br/>
 It's so strange to not just be able to hit one all off switch, but to actually have to go walk around your house.
 And you said that you were missing Alexa earlier.
 I am missing Alexa.<br/>
 I just love that somehow you've fallen into my cunning plan.
 Yes, well, she makes my life easier in that I can walk downstairs and say, Alexa, turn on all the lights and they come on.
 You realize that turn off all the lights.
 You realize every time you say that, and everybody who's listening to this with an Amazon,
 echoes are like two turning off. Sorry about that, folks.
 The second thing we've been doing is, we say this every week, we've had a busy week. Well, of course,
 but I realized that pastors, which we are spend most of our time in any one of three different
 types of meetings. Yeah. The first meeting that we spend time in are ones that we're speaking at,
 like a conference meeting or Sunday church. Sure. And if we're not speaking, we're listening,
 like if you're a emanate teaching, I'm on the front row listening.
 Yeah, and you have several of those a week.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Less so when we're not teaching school.
 Yes.<br/>
 And the second type of meetings we have are the meetings,
 kind of staff meetings, one to our decisions need to be made.
 Like every Monday we get together with our school staff
 and we talk about decisions for the upcoming school.
 We pray for our students, we pray for the upcoming school.
 We have a pastor's meeting every second Wednesday,
 yada, yada, yada.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 And then the last type of meeting that we do is when we meet with people who are
 looking for prayer or wisdom or support or we did all three of those this week. We
 probably do all three of those every week. But that was it packing and meetings. We didn't
 eat anywhere. We're watching. I'm trying to make you eat everything out of the freezer.
 Well, we should talk about the fun of you cutting meals out of I've got half piece of
 cod. I've got some blueberries. I call it kitchen MacGyvering. I call it kitchen lottery.
</p><ul>
  <li>Well, it's MacGyvering.
 It's looking at all the things that I have
 in making a masterpiece, or sometimes an absolute failure.
 But mostly, it's okay.
  </li><li>Have you found anything that surprised you?
 I know I'm leading into something,
 but I was genuinely wondering,
 did you find anything this week that you were like,
 "Oh, that's where that was."
  </li><li>Well, now that you said that you're leading into something,
 I don't know.
  </li><li>Well, no, just did you find anything
 like one of our children under a mound of cardboard boxes?
 No, I usually know where they are.
 I don't think I did find anything that I didn't.
 No, not so far.
 I found our very first iPhone.
 You did.
 And it still looks like a nice phone, really.
 No, it doesn't.
 It looks like a nice phone from 2007.
 Yeah, but it's still like--
 if you looked at any other phone from 2007,
 you'd be like, oh my gosh, that's a piece of garbage.
 And the iPhone still looks like a pretty phone.
 It fits about into 25% of my iPhone 6 plus.
 But it's much thicker.
 It looks like a bar soap and I was surprised
 to find it actually started up.
 So did you like check out any apps on it or anything?
 No, because I remember the digitizer
 on the screen is broken.
 So only a third of the screen for the ones to dance.
 Did we keep this piece of junk?
 Oh, I'm gonna throw out.
 I didn't know I had kept it.
 I'm not particularly nostalgic.
 But here's our topic.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 around by finding treasures as you're back in your house.
 I posted this on Instagram a couple of days ago.
 I found some cassette tapes.
 Remember cassette tapes?
  </li><li>Oh yeah, those little plastic things.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And instantly I looked at these tapes.
 They're some by Jack Deere and some by John Paul Jackson.
 And I was instantly brought back to probably like 15
 or maybe 16 years ago when I lived in Scotland
 as a school teacher, I'd get a ride to school in the morning with one of my colleagues
 and then I'd walk home with probably about half hour walk home. And I would just listen
 to these teaching tips. Now, remember at this point, I didn't know anything about the prophetic.
 I didn't know anything about how to hear God's voice. I didn't have any teaching on the prophetic,
 but somehow I stumbled across John Paul Jackson. I can't even remember how I ended up doing that.
 And I would just listen to this teaching because I'm so desperate to understand this thing about the voice of God.
 And John Paul Jackson, who's now with the Lord, sadly, I so appreciate his teaching.
 And so I'm caught right back up with all the feelings, all the emotions of listening to this thing thinking, could this even be true?
 I saw these teachings and thought, gosh, I used to listen to all this stuff before I understood any of this stuff.
 And I actually remember, forget not understanding it, but I went from not knowing if you could
 hear God's voice to reading these books, listening to these tapes, being moved to having no experience
 of hearing God's voice, but hoping it was true based on their stories and their teaching,
 to then believing it was true, to then eventually thinking I was actually hearing God,
 to grow in confidence that i was here in got and finally like today i hear god's voices off as i choose to listen right so it's funny knowing what i know now.
 Going back in my memories remembering i want i don't know if any of this was real right and so anyway i just thought it was really funny cuz i was having these flashbacks i guess and one sense to.
 You know, just imagine myself. Here's what I thought. I imagined my present day self going back
 in time to my past self saying, hey, when you get into the future, you're going to spend
 a large portions of your life, training people all over the world how to hear God's voice.
 And just thinking how that would have affected my little heart. I think I would have been
 just filled with unbelief. Yeah, it's hard to say. I think God often moves your heart in
 smaller steps rather than larger steps because you're right, then we would move in doubt and
 unbelief instead of in faith, right? But if yeah, like when I think about any of the big things
 that God's done, he didn't give me a clue as to those things until it was like a step away from them.
 That's a really good point. You know, it was it was smaller steps of just like, oh,
 how about this? Are you a little bit hungry for this? Are you a little bit bothered by this,
 is bothered enough to look into it. What do you think about, you know, and he sort of
 let's you get aggravated in a good way until you're wanting to look for an answer.
 And I think that was, I think you summarized it brilliantly, baby, you hit the nail on
 the head because I was laughing that sitting here in this position where I am today, it's
 almost like, well, of course you listen to, you know, stuff on the prophetic because that's
 what you do most of the time. But it didn't feel like that at all. I felt completely bewildered,
 felt happenstance I stumbled onto. It wasn't, I will now learn about the prophetic. It was just,
 here's this thing, I think it might be true, but now looking back, I'm realizing the volume of
 stuff I consumed is really interesting with no sense of purpose or direction that this would
 ultimately benefit me in the future. But I think that's what God does with the prophetic. I think
 He gives us a word to our present that speaks to our future and somehow we gravitate towards that
 whether we even realize we're doing that or not. You know when you get prophesied over and you get
 this word and seasons pass and you look back and you're like, "Oh yeah, I have kind of gravitated
 towards that without really understanding that that's happening." Yeah. I think most often,
 It's like God lights something in your heart that may seem really too big for what you can imagine yourself doing.
 And then you continue plotting on with life, just saying yes to God in the smaller things and before you know it,
 you're doing the big thing that he was talking to you about.
 But most often we sort of look back at prophetic words and go, oh, that was in there like, you know, X amount of years ago.
 Oh, I totally missed that.
 I wonder if God opens a door in your heart that there's just a little part of you that's saying,
 yes, and he's like, "I'll take that yes," and then processes you forward through all the things
 need to happen to get you there. Well, that's just the nature of God, isn't it? He's always...
 I think everything God is doing is per-operation for what he's going to do next.
 I was struck by that. I posted that thing on Instagram, and I just thought of these two hashtags,
 feed your dreams and starve your fears. And I thought, I wouldn't have believed 15 years ago
 that God was going to do what he's done in these past 15 years. So got me thinking, what's God
 going to do in the next 15 years, that I wouldn't believe my future self if he came and told me.
 Because the thing with God is he, he's always going to outdream your dreams. Like all the stuff I
 dreamed about back then weren't even fully formed dreams. I think probably because I was
 scared to dream. Like we were talking last week about the importance of learning to celebrate.
 I think we need to learn to dream too, because I realized I put a straight jacket on most of my
 dreams because I worried that my hopes and aspirations were too worldly. I've since learned that God
 sanctifies everything. Yeah. And we think we have to, there's a correct way of dreaming.
 Right. And we don't need to worry like that, because whatever you bring to God, your dreams
 included as a sacrifice he receives and in our experience only ever upgrades. He's so trustworthy
 with the future. What about some of the things that when you look back 15, 20 years, because you're
 a little older than me, I'm just kidding. Shocking behavior. But when you look backwards, what are you
 astonished at what God's done? Well, really, the whole lot of it. I mean, when I think, when I've
 started getting, I think when I started getting prophetic words about, you know, traveling
 and speaking and all that kind of stuff, I was so far from being in a place where that
 would really be my reality that it seemed, it seems just lunacy.
 Right.
 You know, and it wasn't, it was, it was not something I desired to do.
 Um, but on top of that, it seemed like God, you, you would have to be crazy to let me
 do that. You know, like, I just, I know me, I know I'm broken. I can't imagine that I'm
 ever going to get to a place where you can actually use my life like that. And so like,
 like, and then, you know, but I did say yes, you know, I remember going, well, I remember
 having a conversation with the Lord where I basically said, well, Lord, I say yes, but
 but you've got a lot of work to do, you know,
 because I'll say yes, but I don't like people that much.
 I don't like travel.
 I don't wanna speak.
 Like there's some massive hurdles to get over
 for any of these dreams to be a reality, you know?
 And it's funny to think, well,
 and it didn't happen overnight, you know,
 it took eight years before I spoke the first time.
 even then I was incredibly nervous, you know, but it's just like the, the Lord is, is funny
 because he'll just take that little yes. And then he, as long as you keep saying yes, he keeps doing
 what needs to be done to get us where we need to be, which is awesome.
 I think my favorite prophetic word that you've ever told me you've received is the one that
 Marta Pawn gave you, where he said, if you don't want your life, why don't you give it to God and
 see what he can do with it? He's done a pretty good job.
 Yeah, he's really done a pretty good job because I think the most telling statement you told me was you were like,
 Alan, I was the person that people would walk around at church.
 Like don't engage with AJ or you're going to be stuck.
 She's the trauma ridden right off person who's just going to suck any sort of life out of you.
 You know, she's damaged goods and you're just amazing to me.
 Like, I remember meeting you in 2003 and hearing your testimony and just thinking.
 like you're a testimony of God making all things new because you don't even have any
 the residue of someone who'd been through the trauma that you'd been through.
 Yeah. I mean, I don't even really know. I suppose I don't really know what people were
 thinking when they saw me back in those days. I guess I thought that they thought that because
 I knew what I felt like on the inside. Right. And people didn't really stop and talk to
 with the exception of the couple of dads.
 On the flip side, I was probably putting off
 the whole stay away from me, kind of scenario,
 but yeah, I was such a mess on the inside.
 And that's where I was when I started getting those words.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Which is just amazing, 'cause I think sometimes,
 even as a prophetic person, you prophesy over someone
 according to what God's saying about them.
 And then, you know, sometimes you end up having a conversation with them later and you're like,
 gosh, I hope I didn't mess that up.
 Like this person seems pretty far from what has been said, you know, but often God is calling what
 isn't as though it is.
 That's his nature.
 Yeah.
 He speaks a prophetic word so that what he's spoken can come to pass.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 But I'm just thinking, you know, many times I've sort of given a word about something like boldness or, you know, whatever.
 and then afterwards a person comes up and they're like, "Thanks, I'm really not bold."
 Or whatever the thing is.
 And you're like, "Okay, I mean, you know that life and death are in the tongue and part
 of vision is starting to receive what God's saying about you and starting to lay down
 what you think about yourself and all that kind of stuff.
 But it's just fun to see.
 I don't know.
 I wish you could track everybody you've ever prophesied over and see what they are 10 years later. You know what I mean?
 Yeah, and what kind of conversations they've had with the Lord and what kind of amazing things he's done their behalf. You know aside from
 Destiny and dreams bundled in with that. I I've just been reflecting on
 the people that God brings into your life. Yeah, because
 There's a dynamic. I'm sure we've all experienced and it's this weird dynamic where you
 read a book or you listen to podcast or you hear somebody share a conference or you read an interview with somebody and some level you find yourself connecting with this complete stranger i mean,
 you don't know them you never met them but there is a connection this,
 this sense of if we knew each other we could be friends like or i think like your i appreciate that about you yeah and that's awkward because we don't know where to put it.
 that feeling we don't know what to do and I've had tons of those through my life.
 Right.
 You know, reading books or listening to teaching or any of the above that I mentioned before.
 But I was finding it humorous the other day just thinking that now in this season of my life,
 how many people that I'm in relationship with are those people who I had no way of meeting,
 no way of connecting, no reason to ever be in relationship with now. And so many of my friends,
 so many of my connections I have are now with people who I used to read about or read their books
 or listen to their teaching and or you know work with and just think, "Lord, that's incredible,
 because never in a million years was like, is that going to become my aim to meet so-and-so?"
 It was just so absurd.
 I lived in a completely different country, for example.
 But I think if I've learned anything from that,
 it's actually pay attention to that feeling in your heart.
 As in, I think it's important to pay attention to what
 and who your heart is interested in.
 No matter how ludicrous it is,
 because you don't know what's gonna happen in two years.
 You know what's gonna happen in five or in 10 or in 15?
 You don't know who you're gonna connect with
 and have this somewhat tenuous shared history.
 But I've learned to pay attention to those
 and then ask God for connections,
 especially people who show up in my dreams.
 People who show up in my dreams repeatedly.
 I'm asking the Lord to foster relationships
 with these people and I'm not intimidated by geography.
  </li><li>Right, but I think too, the key to what you just said
 is ask God to form a connection.
 Don't try and form one yourself.
 good Lord, that will backfire faster than you can say.
 I've watched that backfire where people are just been like, well, you know, I feel connected
 to this person.
 So they're in hot pursuit of some sort of connection with them.
 And I don't mean hot pursuit like dating.
 I just, you know, and I've never seen that turn out well.
 No, because the connection is only one sided.
 Right.
 And you're like, that person doesn't know who you are from Adam.
 So you're going to have to like God start that one up for you.
 And you're going to freak them out if you're like, Oh my gosh, we could be best friends
 if you just move here.
 Right.
 I've probably shown you see that work once.
 Yeah, yeah, I saw it work once too.
 But generally speaking, I just think I've learned that God is so optimistic about our
 future.
 He's so forward looking and of course he loves the present, but he's so excited about where
 we're going and what we're doing.
 And I think, I just thought when he considers our future, why don't we consider it with
 the same level of excitement or optimism?
 That'd be good, wouldn't it?
 So my question for you and for me and for our listeners is, what are you doing to feed
 your future?
 When we answer?
 No, I'm just throwing out in a rhetorical sense like, what are you doing to feed your
 future?
 What are you doing now that you have the hopes of it paying off dividends later in life?
 Relationally, emotionally, spiritually, physically?
 Yeah, I just think head.
 where your attention is headed towards and follow it and throw some resources behind it.
 Yeah. And stop feeding fear. Yeah. Feed your dreams and starve your fears.
 That's really good, baby. All right. That's my best thinking so far.
 I like your thinking. Thanks. It worked for me.
 All right. I've got a listening question for you.
 Okay. This is from Quincy.
 Hi, Quincy.
 I'm going to let you answer it because it's firmly within your domain of expertise.
 Okay. Hello, my name is Quincy. I listened to your podcast and I really enjoy them. I especially
 enjoyed this last podcast about the orphaned spirit. You can tell we're a few episodes behind
 on our listeners questions. I was like, I don't think that was last week, but okay, good, good, good.
 I had a few questions. Is the orphaned spirit a spirit or a mindset?
 If it is a mindset, what can I do on my end to renew my mind? Can you suggest some scriptures
 I can study on sonship.
 Quincy, yeah, it's a mindset.
 It's not a spirit per se.
 So it's not something that you get delivered from.
 Typically, it's a way of thinking that we've learned from a number of different sources.
 So it can be from our upbringing, it can be from our church upbringing,
 be from life experiences with our family, second of stuff.
 In terms of how do you renew your mind, any of the father heart kind of passages would
 probably work really well for just meditating on those things. So whether you're looking at
 the prodigal son out of Luke 15 or Romans 8 starting around verse 14, we're talking about
 spirit of adoption. Jeremiah 31, is it 31? 3? Yep. You know, 1 John 3 verse 1, 1 John 4 verse 16.
 like there's lots of verses where it talks about God's unconditional love, the way that
 He views us as sons, and really the deal is signing up, like sort of saying, "Okay,
 Lord, I really want to know you like that. I really want to live out of sonship. Lord, would you
 eradicate anything in me that is really more of an orphan mindset, more that says, "I have to strive
 earn or that I'm on my own and just allow the Holy Spirit to do that in you.
 There's also a couple of great resources. You wrote a book, which is all about
 journeying from thinking like an orphan to becoming a son. That's called
 Finding Father. You can look for a link in that in the show notes. But also Jack Frost,
 who's also with the Lord, wrote an amazing book called From Spiritual
 Slavery to Spiritual Sunship. You can get that up and link to that in the
 show notes, both those are excellent resources. But it is so vital. I think the thing that
 his fueled our life for many, many years is the revelation the fathers love. And the
 corresponding way of living from that, which we call sonship, which applies to both men
 and women. Sorry that we're a little bit shorter than we plan on being, but with our
 packing schedule right now, we have got still got to edit this impact before we get to bed.
 Here's some things for you to go away with.
 It's our friends, and I keep meaning to mention this, Blake Stratton and Elena Stratton have
 got a brand new podcast called White Flag Wealth.
 Look it up on iTunes.
 It's really, really good.
 It's all about a journey into abundance.
 And with that, the shaking off of orphan-like thinking and a poverty mindset, they're brilliant.
 They're super authentic.
 They're super real, super transparent.
 I've really enjoyed listening to their episodes this week.
 I'd really recommend it.
 It's called White Flag Wealth.
 you can get that on iTunes.
