<p> My blonde haired god ass how are you?<br/>
 I'm fine.<br/>
 What do you want to say about my hair?
 It is cut.<br/>
 Somebody asked me if I was joining the Navy SEALs.
 I was like, I think they require something a little bit more stringent than just a haircut.
 It looks good though.<br/>
 I like it.<br/>
 Thanks.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I couldn't find my normal barber.<br/>
 So I had somebody else.<br/>
 Well, I was your normal barber and then I got like replaced by one or something.
 What's your what's your barbers name?<br/>
 Tony Frank.<br/>
 We went from one to Tony Frank.<br/>
 Doesn't matter what my barbers name is.
 I was going to say talk to him about a week.
 But I think we need to pause and just acknowledge how awesome Chris from
 chlorine is.<br/>
 He was excellent and hysterical.<br/>
 So it feels funny to go back to our format that we skipped because we want to
 make as much time as possible for Chris.
 But we got lots of great feedback from you guys this week.
 Chris, you're just in jeans, we love you.
 And actually, he's not here to say.<br/>
 So starting this week, we taught the school super natural life.
 It was nice to see all of students after a Christmas break.
 It was great to see them.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And we're going to teach on how to teach.
 We're going to teach how to teach, which is such a meta topic, because you're
 teaching them how you're doing what you're doing right now.
 But I love that whole process.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And then making your what you do plane.
 Yeah, making your thinking visible.<br/>
 And then next week they are going to be teaching us.
 Yep.<br/>
 And I love it that the quality of the teachers that we produce is quite astonishing.
 I think it's amazing.<br/>
 Aminate Monday night.<br/>
 I'm a nice.<br/>
 Deak worship, emanate Monday night, Jesse early.
 Seriously, what's going on?<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 It was so good.<br/>
 It was really good.<br/>
 Your message is really good too.<br/>
 Thanks. I will, we're doing this reading the Bible through the years of church, which I haven't read the Bible through in a year in a while. I've done it several times. I've read it chronologically. I've done it, you know, the reading plan type stuff.
 But as the church, we're doing one and we're using the youth version app and doing Nikki Gumbel's one. And I'm finding every time I'm reading the Bible, we're trying to, as soon as I wake up in the morning, I'm trying to read through it.
 But I'm just getting blown away by all this revelation, but this revelation about John the Baptist Jesus comes to be baptized by him.
 And in a new living translation, it says that John the Baptist tried to talk him out with it.
 And so I just started thinking of all the times in my life, I've tried to talk God out of accomplishing what he wants to accomplish in my life.
 Ask me if I have any New Year's resolutions.
 Do you have any New Year's resolutions?
 I'm glad you asked that.<br/>
 Yes, it's to stop talking God out of the destiny of my life.
 Excellent.<br/>
 It sounds fantastic.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 I wish them fun this week because we had some friends of our gym and pat banks who are
 in our healing.<br/>
 I wonder if they'd like to be called in our healing specialists, but they are.
 Their ministries.<br/>
 Trauma is one of their specialties.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 And so they were coming into minister to our staff at the start of the year, our pastoral
 staff that came into a great session.<br/>
 They're like revelation machines.<br/>
 claim to fame is that I got them on Twitter, except they were already on Twitter.
 They just didn't know. But they teach in such tweet-sized chunks. I was like, "Oh,
 it's important that the world hears your revelation." Anyway, we got to have some private
 ministry with them, which was awesome. We did. Individually. Yeah. It was fantastic.
 I think that's one of the things that I love most about sitting under the leaders we sit
 under and the culture that we have at Grey Centre and the culture that we had at Toronto
 is that nobody freaks out when our pastoral team says, "I'm going to go get some ministry."
 Nobody's like, "Oh my God, is there marriage falling apart?" It's just normal.
 I just love that for so many reasons. It frees us up to not have to be perfect.
 And it also frees us up to stop doing what we're doing and be ministered to.
 Can we talk about our Nintendo Wii that we got for Christmas?
 Sure. Let's talk about our Nintendo Wii.
 Well, you were really keen on getting it.
 I wasn't a hard sell, to be honest, being a Nintendo fan, but I haven't played Nintendo in a while.
 But I'm shocked at how much our kids love it.
 I didn't think they'd get into it.<br/>
 But not only do they love playing it, they love watching their daddy play it.
 They do.<br/>
 Actually, when you guys play it together, they want you to carry them.
 So that means they're not actually playing.
 Yes.<br/>
 What's the time when we're multi-playing a game?
 You're carrying it up to you.<br/>
 I'm picking up to you.<br/>
 I just take a cat, so I have to first complete a level to learn how the level works.
 Then I have to carry on my shoulders around the level anyway.
 They're so into it, but also they get totally into watching me try and be a level and there is high pitch screaming when I die.
 And even MJ, he just never clear what's happening.
 No, they'll start screaming.<br/>
 So he joins in.<br/>
 It's so screaming.<br/>
 It's awesome.<br/>
 No, no, it isn't.<br/>
 talking about what happened.<br/>
 Was it Wednesday night or Thursday night?
 Thursday night.<br/>
 So I had to remove myself from the room.
 It was just too overwhelming.<br/>
 So a number of months ago, um, Katie Cook and and Tink came over and
 introduced us to one direction.<br/>
 See, I don't call them.<br/>
 Trent Trent was.<br/>
 And Trent, um, I don't.<br/>
 We watched the one direction.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 I'm not calling them new direction anymore.
 See, that's a good step.<br/>
 You know what?<br/>
 Darning your almost hip.<br/>
 That's right.<br/>
 I'm so close to hip is not even funny.
 So anyway, so then when we got this game for the week, it's called just dance 2015.
 And I was, um, I played it one time with the girls, like on Christmas day.
 And I played it one day.<br/>
 I never played.<br/>
 I wasn't here to see it because they got you to do it because I was near.
 For those of you who've never seen it, do you remember the arcade?
 it was like a game called Dance Dance Revolution where basically there's somebody dancing on
 the screen and you have to do syncopated moves with whatever they were doing. But in
 the arcade it was like this touch sensitive floor pad. Well with this one with the Wii
 controller you just hold it in your right hand and you just dance following the choreographed
 steps that professional dancers were doing to songs that were released in 2014. And it
 is so stinking difficult for an uncoordinated lump such as myself.
 But I was astonished.<br/>
 I mean, Ting is a professional dancer.
 You have dance in your background.<br/>
 And I'm sure Katie--
</p><ul>
  <li>She must.
  </li><li>She must.
  </li><li>She could move, yeah.
  </li><li>But the three of you picked up so quickly,
 it would be ridiculous. - You're a superman.
  </li><li>And I posted a video of you dancing to the ground
 and then suddenly realized, yeah,
 I'm not sure how good this looks that
 (laughs)
 I'm filming three girls dancing from behind in my room.
 So I went obsessed with my godroom
 and became holier than watching you guys dance,
 but you did it for what, an hour and a half?
  </li><li>Oh, at least.
  </li><li>It was like a workout.
  </li><li>It was a total workout.
 We were like, huffing and puffing
 and having to drink water and take breaks.
 It was just like, but it was super fun.
 And I didn't know if it would be fun for adults
 to do like the girls like doing it,
 but I didn't know if it would be fun for adults.
 So I have an idea for my next girls night.
  </li><li>It's also funny watching.
 So we play this game, what is it?
 3D Super Mario Land, something like that.
 And Abby loves it.
 Abby can play on her own.
 She can work through the lands.
 But she doesn't understand the way I approach the game,
 which is when I play a level,
 I don't just wanna finish the level,
 which is what she wants to do.
 I want to complete all the challenges in the level,
 which is get the three green stars,
 Make sure I pick up the hidden stamp and at the end,
 reach the top of the flagpole.
 So I get a golden flagpole,
 doesn't have a normal flagpole.
 Oh dear God, I'm saying these words out loud.
  </li><li>Yeah, I was wondering if you could actually hear them or...
 (laughs)
 Yes, it's very important to get the three green stars
 in the funny stamp.
  </li><li>I want a good golden pole you are.
  </li><li>But I'm just realizing,
 what am I writing on my girl's hearts?
 I don't get mad at them for not completing it, but maybe I am overemphasizing the need for perfection.
 Do you think I last think of his perfection and more think of it doing it properly.
 So the other day T is waiting to play for you with you. I'm sorry and you went into the bathroom and I guess she had like nine lives.
 So she just kept taking her little princess and running it off the edge into the oblivion.
 Waiting for you to get there. She's like my meat. I don't know how to pause it
 So she just you know she get a new girl and she just run it right off the side
 You know, you know why why would you just wait for me?
 Well because it already started and she didn't know how to pause it
 So she just decided she didn't want it the little girl to get eaten by a mushroom or something
 So she preferred that it just took like the death dive off the side of the cliff sounds like we're introducing our children
 So much trauma for this game. Honestly, let's move on. I have concerns about the game
 What is your main complaint about Gary Morgan whom we love if you had if you'd one thing to complain about Gary Morgan the Welsh Eagle?
 That he keeps posting pictures of food that I can't eat because I'm not there the thing I want to complain about Gary Morgan is he posted
 something on Instagram last week about a TV show called state of affairs and
 He was like you know Gary's the chief influencer. I'd never even heard of it. And so we thought you know Gary and I have
 Similar tastes I thought well, we'll look it up
 And we just did a hulu binge of like the first six or seven episodes and now we're hooked.
 And I don't like watching TV that forces me to wait.
 I like to just know that the season is over and I can just watch him at my base.
 But it looks like the episodes come out every single Monday.
 Yeah, it's horrible to have to wait.
 I have to wait.
 Yeah.
 So thanks a lot Gary for introducing us.
 Thanks a lot Gary.
 Yeah.
 I I went up for lunch with Holly.
 on Friday. Who's Holly? She's my cousin.
 Oh, I.
 My cousin.
 Well, totally hang around with her. I remember her vaguely. That's right. Yeah.
 I remember Holly. That's right. Yeah.
 She has a husband who, you know, he kind of looks up to me in terms of athleticism.
 Yes, absolutely. Yeah.
 Like my running history, I think he's inspired him to be a running. Well, yes, probably.
 It's just because he's so short that he looks up to you as well.
 And for those of you don't know, Don and Holly, they're possibly the fittest people we know.
 And you're currently in a fit bit competition with them, which is it's lunacy.
 Well, I'm not in a competition with them, but you can sign up.
 Let's clarify.
 We all have fit bits.
 And every day you frenetically check your fit bit thing to see where they're at,
 to see if you've possibly by a miracle beaten them, but you're not in competition with them.
 Well, you're supposed to let you I'm not in a competition with them, but you're supposed
 to allow yourself to be competitive enough to want to get better.
 But I think you're in.
 But there's not a chance last week he was posting numbers like 98,000 steps in a week.
 My high score until this week was like 36,000 steps.
  </li><li>But doesn't he run like 100 miles a day?
  </li><li>I think probably 100 miles is an exaggeration.
 Listen, he's 6'7", I don't think he should get
 the amount of credit because he will cover more ground
 faster 'cause his legs are so long.
  </li><li>Doesn't fit, but can that into consideration?
  </li><li>I don't know, I don't know if he has to tell it.
  </li><li>I like that.
  </li><li>I like the outsourced being fit
 by downloading fitness tracking apps.
 Because that's going to get you there.
 Well, what it does is it helps track stats.
 And so I feel like I'm doing something about my health.
 And the greatest app I found for that most recently is called Argus.
 Now, anybody from the UK will remember Argus as this really weird shop where you'd
 look up stuff in a magazine, you'd go in, you'd fill in something on an index card
 and out from the back of a warehouse, it'd bring you this.
 I thought that was our go.
 Yeah.
 Did you do it in front of CS?
 Did you have it in Canada?
 No, I just remember seeing it in the UK.
 OK, well, it was spelled A-R-G-O-S.
 Oh, OK.
 This app not to confuse you is spelled A-R-G-U-S,
 but it sounds the same.
 Argus.
 Good.
 I'm sorry, AJ, did you want to say something?
 Argus.
 It's my southern male.
 Argus.
 Tracks.
 Well, it integrates with stuff that you're wearing already.
 like it integrates with your Fitbit.
 It integrates with your, you know, it can track your, what do you call it?
 Your heartbeat, that's right.
 Your sleep cycle.
 So anyway, I like keeping track of that stuff.
 I should probably do something about it to better the results.
 Right.
 Oh, look at that.
 I've only taken four steps today, but I've tracked them.
 I like what you're saying.
 Hey, you know, before we go any further, I've meant to this a couple of weeks in a row.
 You wanted to just say how beautiful I am and I'm excited you are a better
 anniversary this week.
 You are super beautiful.
 And we do have an anniversary this week.
 We do, which means we're going to have the best throwback Thursday because our
 anniversary is actually on Thursday.
 So we can post on Instagram pictures of our wedding legitimately.
 We could hashtag throwback Thursday.
 It's true.
 Yeah.
 We really good.
 I already dug some out.
 You've got it all ready to go.
 Well, I don't have all of it premeditated.
 We only have like a handful of good photos from our wedding anyway, so it was slim pickings.
 This is what I wanted to say was.
 You wanted to tell everybody what you're doing in a
 industry that you're not telling me because it's a surprise.
 No, we can tell them that next week and then it won't be surprising.
 It wouldn't be real.
 But then I'm not going to get any any information today.
 Yeah, but I've bound you in the spirit from accessing a prophetic gift for this.
 And I wrap my head in 10 while we go back.
 And I see you can't read my thought.
 That explains that noise.
 for a third time.
 Oh, sorry.
 You know how I like to talk about it.
 And I keep forgetting.
 Would you like to talk about it?
 A couple of weeks ago at M&amp;A, Josh and Sarah Parsons had a friend of theirs,
 Michaela, who is American, but lives in Norway.
 Now we have a deep affinity for Norway and we have quite like Michaela.
 We've married a couple of times when she's come in and visit Josh and Sarah.
 But I was really tickled pink.
 Is that an expression you use?
 I was really, I was greatly.
 You could use it.
 I think it's just for little girls though.
 I was I was I just found it really amazingly she said hey guys I listen to your podcast I just thought gosh it's really funny to think of somebody in Norway listen to our podcast because here we are in Franklin in our
 Godroom recording this and I'll post on the internet tomorrow and it's likely that she's gonna hear it Norway so then I went to a website and looked at all the different countries around the world that listen to it went to me from Romania listen this week so
 Yeah, hello Romania. I don't know if you're the same Romania person, but thank you for tuning in.
 But anyway, I want to say hello to Michaela. She is one of YWAM bases there.
 You greatly encouraged us when you were there. And we just wanted to say we love Norway,
 we love me. Do you know what I want to devote this whole podcast to?
 Giving me hints about our anniversary dinner. As a prophet right now, you're failing
  </li><li>Wow. - Just trying to get some information.
  </li><li>You already know what we're doing.
 How are we made plans?
 You win the car when I made plans.
  </li><li>Okay. I'm just not sure if it's all a smokescreen.
 You know.
  </li><li>Why would you say that?
 (laughs)
 Why would you say that?
  </li><li>I don't know.
  </li><li>You call me a liar on here.
 (laughs)
 I love that filthy laugh of your--
  </li><li>Or a creative planner.
 (laughs)
 I just didn't think you'd take me to Denny's for anniversary.
 You know what, baby?
 It's Captain Dees.
 Why fish in the expensive part of the ocean?
 Okay.
 Where is the expensive part of the ocean?
 All right.
 What we're devoting our podcast to is our backlog of listeners' questions.
 Because bless you, you've written in and you've asked questions.
 And this, and sometimes we don't get to them.
 And so we want to get to them.
 And sometimes your questions, the reason we can't answer them is they're great questions,
 but they demand a sermon and we're trying not to preach on our podcast.
 So to do our best in not preaching, here are the answers to the most recent list of questions
 that we have not responded to.
 So this first one is from Becky.
 She asks, "What are appropriate boundaries to have with your parents and your in-laws
 when you've just had a baby?"
 And for context, both sets of grandparents live in town and are itching to spend as much
 as time as possible with their grandson as you would imagine.
 I'll hand that one over to you, H. Jones, as the baby boundary expert.
 Well, I guess my question would be, what kind of boundaries do you want to have with your
 grandparents or with your parents?
 Because I know plenty of people where their parents are typically way more involved in
 in their lives than what we experience.
 You know, 'cause our parents are--
  </li><li>On the other side of the world?
  </li><li>In different countries.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And they love it that their parents are involved
 and then other people are like,
 well, I like it to an extent, you know?
 So I think really it's more about you
 and your husband figuring out what's life for you,
 when does it stop being a blessing
 and start being like a,
 oh my gosh, get out of my house, that kind of stuff.
 and maybe back off a step from there.
  </li><li>Back off to her three steps from,
 I now only leave my house.
  </li><li>Right, and just sort of establish,
 okay, this is actually what would work for us.
  </li><li>I think the thing is when people hear boundaries,
 they hear this very harsh line
 and are rattled with fear
 and are worried it's gonna come out in aggression,
 but it really doesn't have to.
 You know, basically you've got two sets of parents here
 who are super excited that you've just had a baby
 and we'll want to show as much love and affection as they possibly can.
 And what is love and affection to them might be overwhelming and uncomfortable for you
 and they don't know that.
 And so just simply communicating in love like, "I love that you want to come over and see
 the baby.
 I love that you want to come and help me."
 Here's the thing, we're new to this whole baby, Malarkey.
 We really don't know what we're doing.
 Here's what is working first.
 Here's not what's working first.
 just start expressing what would work. And I think most people worry that when they do
 that, that you're going to cut off relationship with a person and you're really not, especially
 your parents, especially parents who are, you know, now if you're feeling particularly
 emotional, which is highly likely given you just had a baby and you're tired and let's
 face it, you don't know what you're doing because you just had your first baby. We suggest
 you never really communicate to people when you're in a state of halt, whether you're
 hungry, angry, lonely or tired. It's a good chance you're one of those right now as you
 listen to the sad podcast. So it's not two or three.
 Sit down with your husband and just kind of work out what works for us. And then just
 communicate that to your mom and dad or to your in-laws like and keep the love up high
 to reduce the anxiety.
 We, you know, we did baby whites with all of our kids, but I remember with Abby, you know,
 my mom would want to come over because we lived in Canada at the time and my mom would
 want to come over and see her and we would just be like, "Okay, well, if you want to,
 you can, she'll be awake from because she was on a schedule. We knew when she'd be awake."
 So we'd say whatever it was, 430 to 6. And she'd say, "Well, I don't know if I can
 make it during that time." I'm like, "Okay, well, then let's try again tomorrow because
 she's on a schedule and this is when she's going to be awake and I'm not keeping her
 or putting her off of her schedule,
 but you know, it'd be great to see you kind of thing.
 So it just sort of depends too on what you want your day
 to look like.
 If you want to stay in your pajamas until noon
 and say nobody comes over till afternoon,
 then it's your house.
  </li><li>I hope that helps.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>All right.
 This is from Caitlin.
 Hi, Alan and AJ.
  </li><li>Hi Caitlin.
  </li><li>Hi, yeah, hi Caitlin.
 How do I know God's best place for me to be?
 I don't feel at home where I'm at and really not sure where to go.
 I've prayed and fasted.
 What would be some next steps in this process?
 Thank you.
 I'm a new listener and really enjoying your podcast.
 Well, thank you for listening to our podcast and sorry,
 it's taken us a while to get to answer your question.
 Do you want to say something or do you want me to jump in?
  </li><li>You go ahead and I'll take for a second.
  </li><li>I'm assuming you're talking geographically here.
 I'm assuming if the Lord isn't saying stay here,
 then maybe he's inviting you into where would you like to go?
 And, you know, us moving to Nashville,
 I think we've told the story on the podcast before,
 but as we went to Nashville,
 we had like a vision, with a dream,
 with an angelic visitation,
 with prophetic words coming out of, you know,
 left, right and center, with confirmations.
 And still, I was like, eh, yeah, I'm not sure.
 And the thing that made me want to move to Nashville was a question that the Lord said to me.
 He just said, "Would you like to move to Nashville?"
 And I never really considered that.
 Like, what you mean outside of what you quote unquote want?
 He's like, "Sure.
 Would you like to?"
 I was like, "Yeah, I'd like to."
 He's like, "Then do it."
 So my question is this whole concept of living under a green light.
 If the Lord is not saying, "Don't move," then he's probably inviting you into a
 season of asking you where you would like to move. But you know, what is it you're looking
 for? What would you like to move? And once your heart percolates up an answer, start
 sharing that with people who are important in your life, who've got a voice in your life
 and just saying, Hey, you know, as I've been thinking about this and as I've been praying
 about this, I'm realizing I'd really like to move to X and start getting feedback and
 then start turning that into prayer like Lord, I would not instead of saying Lord, where
 should I move to? I might suggest saying, I'd like to move here, Lord, do you have anything
 to say on that? Is there wisdom on timing or would you open doors for me on that and
 just look for favor on where you're going?
 I'm asking to shut doors if that's not where you're supposed to go. If you think about,
 again, whenever we're talking about making a decision and what the Lord is like, we often
 say, "He's the best dad ever." If Allen's taking Tia out on a date and Tia says, "Well,
 I want to do on this date is I want to go and play in traffic.
 And then, you know, after that, I want to practice throwing knives or something.
 I'm going to go, Oh, that's no.
 But how about sweet CCs or how about what, you know, and he's going to redirect her.
 He's going to sort of shut down those doors and redirect her, but, but he still wants to know what it is she wants to do.
 I'm at the same time.
 If she brings up something that's, you know, like today, for example, I did take her on a date.
 I said, what do you want to do?
 She said that I can't decide.
 I can't decide between hot chocolate or frozen yogurt."
 And I said, "Well, what do you really want?"
 She's like, "I want them both."
 And I was like, "Well, what do you want more?"
 She's like, "I think I want frozen yogurt."
 So we went to Sweet CC, it's Gus and frozen yogurt.
 And it just so happened to be right across the road
 from Starbucks.
 And it gave me great delight with a glint in my eye to say,
 "Should we go get hot chocolate too?"
 And her concept of, oh, it's not either or it's both and.
 because I'm trying to teach her what the fall is like.
 So, you know, his thoughts towards yours
 countless as the sand on the seashores,
 his plans for you are good.
 So perhaps he's asking for your input
 on where you'd like to move next.
 So I would start there.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Caitlin mentioned fasting.
 Our next question is about fasting.
 This is from Judah.
 He said, "With the coming year,
 I hear a lot of Christians talking about fasting.
 I know that fasting is important part of life as a follower of Jesus, but I don't know too
 much about fasting.
 What are your thoughts on fasting?
 Is there any teaching or books you would recommend that speak on the subject?
 Well, I like fasting if it's God has asked me to do it.
 That's a good way of putting it.
 Did you change what I like fasting to?
 I find there's a grace on fasting when God has asked me to do it.
 Or do you genuinely like fasting?
 No, I genuinely like it.
 If God's asked me to do it, I feel excited.
 I feel connected to God.
 I don't really miss the food.
 Like if God's asked me to do it, I don't find it difficult.
 Oh my gosh, we're so different.
 I find a tremendous ease on fasting when God is asking me to fast.
 And so I approach fasting a couple of different ways, just like prayer.
 I can decide to pray anytime I want.
 I can decide to prophesy anytime I want.
 I can decide to fast anytime I want.
 Or sometimes the Holy Spirit moves me to pray.
 You know, Alan, come and spend some time praying.
 Sometimes the Holy Spirit moves me to prophesy.
 Hey, go over and give that person a word.
 And sometimes the Holy Spirit moves me to fast.
 Right.
 The greatest fruit of fasting, immediate fruit of fasting, I've found in my life.
 is it's the quickest way I know to humble myself.
 On the days that I'm fasting, I am appalled at how haughty my whore is.
 How haughty?
 How haughty.
 Can you explain that?
 Arrogant, prideful.
 Okay.
 I think I know all.
 And I'm unaware of those thoughts on the days I'm not fasting.
 I think on the days I'm not fasting, I just think I'm right and everybody else is wrong.
 In the days I am fasting, I'm just like, "Lord, actually, I'm so sorry, like a lot of
 the time.
 I think I know what I'm doing.
 And when I'm fasting, I'm realizing I'm actually weak and foolish and I just need your wisdom
 and your insight."
 Like that's the most immediate, you know.
 And then long term, I think fasting does a whole lot of stuff behind the scenes that
 we don't see that you can't confuse with you earning, but Jesus does say there's a reward for
 fasting as there is for praying, as there is for giving. So I would direct you to a couple of
 amazing books, Judah, the first book I ever read on fasting that blew my mind. It's a book by
 Mahash Chavda and it's called The Hidden Power of Prayer and Fasting and it was a paradigm shifting
 book for me. The second book I read that I really, really enjoyed is called "Shaping
 History Through Prayer and Fasting" by one of my favorite teachers, Derek Prince. And
 you read a book you really, really liked it. Yeah, I read a book called "God's Chosen Fast."
 Did you look up who it's by? Yeah, by Arthur Wallace.
 And it was more like, it covered it biblically, like, why do we do it? But it also talked about
 physiologically like what's happening in your body and how do you break a fast?
 You know, if you've gone over 10 days, then there's a certain way that you should break a fast,
 which I learned the hard. Same. I called emergency. I think there's something in me trying to get
 out. Alien. I remember calling the NHS emergency helpline. I like 2 a.m. in the morning. I can't
 I can't remember long I'd fasted for, but I did not break the fast well.
 And I'm sure I'm rupturing my small intestine.
 And the person's like, well, what have you eaten?
 And so I dilled my head and eaten for a certain number of days and are like, why on earth
 would you do that?
 And I'm like, and I thought, I don't have a good answer.
 Like, I'm fasting.
 I'm a Christian.
 I don't know.
 And they were like, uh, don't do that again.
 They didn't understand that.
 If you don't want to go buy a book, if you go to iHOP, go Mike Bickle. Mike Bickle has a ton of resources and fasting.
 But he has a very, very handy one or two page article on the basics of fasting and how it's start fasting.
 There's really, really, really helpful rather than throwing yourself in and making the mistakes.
 Age United.
 Does he have something that helps you stop fasting?
 If you've gone, okay.
 Oh yeah, it's all about, you know, different types of fasting and how to start, how to build up your metabolism to handle fasting.
 My funny breaking a fast story just really quickly was it was a 23 day fast.
 We were only intended to fast for 21 days, but we both lost count and there's two of us doing it together and we were with a group of people.
 I'm sorry if I'm not eating food.
 I'm very rigorous about when it ends.
 There is no chance that I'm going to forget both of us didn't notice.
 And then somebody who was with us was like,
 I'm pretty sure you started on it.
 And then we're like, oh, we did.
 So we were with a group of people that were Wendy's
 and we were drinking water and we were like,
 we're done, we're done our 21 days.
 And I got a big classic cheeseburger.
 I thought I was gonna die.
 I ate it and I was like,
 oh, this is the best cheeseburger I've ever tasted.
  </li><li>Did you wash it down with a dog and pepper?
 For good measure.
  </li><li>I don't drink Dr. Pepper and stuff is hideous.
 But I probably had a Coke knowing me then
 because I would have eaten that.
 And I would say probably within 20 minutes,
 I mean, I ended up on the floor in the fetal position
 like just I was in absolute agony.
 I thought I was going to die.
  </li><li>Not a good way to kick out.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>An internal system is shut down after 21 days of night.
  </li><li>It wasn't a good scenario.
  </li><li>Right, Chad, you asked.
  </li><li>Hi, Chad.
  </li><li>When interacting with people who do not believe in Christ,
 how do we lovingly vocalize reasons
 for not listening to certain music, watching certain movies, or playing certain games.
 I find that I dance the line between protecting myself from things that don't need to enter
 my brain and leaving other people feeling judged in some way unintentionally.
 So I'm assuming that you're talking about a friendship group who perhaps mixed, you know,
 made up of some believers, some people who are pre-Christian.
 They're want to watch movies or you're at their house and they're playing music or everyone's
 like, "Oh, let's play cards against humanity,"
 or, "You know, a game you just don't want to play."
 I find probably the three most helpful words
 in that situation just yell at the top of your voice,
 turn or burn.
 (laughs)
 They'll never involve you.
  </li><li>Tell us, game chat.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>I, I, when I first got saved,
 and then when the Lord started healing my heart,
 he really started working on me about movies,
 'cause I would just see any movie going.
 and loved movies didn't think it made a difference to me at all.
 And then I realized it made such a huge difference to me.
 And, you know, my filter with God would get clogged and stuff like that.
 And so, but I didn't want other people to feel bad because they wanted to see
 something that I didn't feel like I had the grace to see.
 And so I would say, I'm, I'm, I'll meet you afterwards.
 And if they'd say, well, why aren't you, you know, see it?
 I would say, I, I feel affected by those kinds of movies.
 like I feel the effects of it and it's just cause dealing with me in a certain area or,
 you know, or I just say, "Oh, I'm just really not into that, but I'll meet you afterwards."
 Yeah, I think you can graciously opt out of things and help your friends.
 I mean, clearly you're a very sensitive person to your friendship group.
 You want to honor them as well as honor the Lord.
 And so clearly you do not think that the world revolves around you, which is great,
 helping them understand that you don't think that and helping them understand that you're
 absolutely fine if they go off and do that and you can meet them afterwards. It's probably
 a really gracious way of doing it, but being bold and being gracious is a great combination.
 All right, next question is from Kayleece. She says, "Hey Alan and AJ."
 Hey Kayleece.
 I have a friend that is skeptical about prophecy. We all do. Don't worry about it.
 in a club, there's t-shirts. He and his family converted from being Mormon and he goes to a
 conservative church, so he doesn't believe in the gifts of prophecy. He does believe in the Holy
 Spirit and thinks since the Holy Spirit can speak to us directly, and why does a human,
 a prophet, need to tell them what God says about them? That's a great question. In Mormonism,
 you have to go through several elders to be able to hear from God, so he and his family don't want
 to be deceived again and they're comfortable with just believing in the Bible. I just want
 to know what you would recommend of how to make prophecy seem desirable to a family that is uninterested.
 It's a great question. It's a really good question. I think there is
 A couple of answers I would give you. One, often in our zeal of the things that God's doing in our
 life, we try and get people to be on the same timetable. I remember Bill Johnson saying we try
 that we tend to overemphasize whatever we last learned. And so in our enthusiasm with what God's
 doing, we want to drag and I mean that in the most positive way, other people into it, but it might
 not be what God's doing in their life. Like if these guys have recently converted from Mormonism,
 is great that they believe in the Bible and it's great that they believe in the Holy Spirit
 and the Holy Spirit being very nature prophetic and the Bible being a prophetic book is going
 to introduce him to the prophetic. That's probably not an answer you were looking for.
 Another answer is I remember somebody rather negatively saying that you can lead a horse
 to water but you can't make it drink and somebody quipped "yeah but you can salt the oats."
 As in, you can provoke something, provoke a hunger in the people around you that they want what you have.
 And the easiest way to do that is by demonstration.
 And so I remember taking people who are skeptical about the prophetic,
 two meetings where prophets were ministering and just being astonished at,
 I remember when Gary Morgan, one of the few times, the last couple of times he was in town.
 Remember he was ministering and while he was ministering he heard the thoughts of someone next to him
 Who said I never get picked for a word and I can't remember if he got her name or not
 But he turned to he turned to the girl and picture and said you you who just said I never go
 I never ever get picked and I never get a word guess what it's your night have a word for you and that
 Shocks her and the people who would knew her would say were you really thinking that?
 You know that that's a demonstration that is easier to
 Display than an argument that you will win. Yeah a third thing you could do is ask the Lord
 To start stirring up the prophetic in their life ask the Lord
 For example, I never believed that God spoke in dreams
 I just thought that was nonsense until I had a dream that
 Literally came to pass three weeks later and then I was like, okay, God. You have my attention
 So you can do lots of stuff like that.
 Bill Johnson on Twitter wrote this.
 He said, "Prophyts do not replace my need to hear from God for myself.
 My need to hear from God for myself does not replace my need of the prophets."
 One of the greatest gifts that God has given his family are prophets and the prophetic ministry.
 And so be patient with them.
 You pursue it.
 You know, watch God do things in your life,
 share the testimonies, and pray for them to get touched.
 And you'll be amazed at what happens.
  </li><li>Um, babe. - Yes, darling.
  </li><li>And there's a whole lot of questions that we're answering.
 How many are left?
  </li><li>We're a little bit backlogged.
 We probably have another four or five.
  </li><li>Um, I need to sleep sometime in the century.
 Is there any way we could just pick one to do tonight?
 and then we can work on the backlog in the next couple of podcasts.
 -Given we are our own bosses and the directors of our own podcast,
 we can do whatever we want.
 -Oh, yay. I'm still dying.
 -I feel like the Holy Spirit saying I should yodel.
 So brace yourself.
 -I'm ready.
 -Wait, that wasn't the Holy Spirit. That was my friend.
 -Really?
 -You know what, rather than answering another question,
 why don't we push pause there?
 We'll try and answer another question a week as we continue going forward.
 But I wanted to let everybody know that our school is supernatural life,
 is now accepting applications for this fall. We have an eight month school. We actually
 have two of them now. We have year one and year two. But we have an eight month school
 that starts in September here in Franklin, Tennessee held a grace in the school, runs
 on Mondays and Tuesdays. You come with grace in our Sunday and for eight months you are
 immersed in the love of God. You get teaching from our pastoral staff. You get teaching
 from age and I get teachers, teaching from prophets and revivalists and teachers and
 leaders from all over the world. We file them in and it is an amazing opportunity to just come
 and set aside your Mondays and Tuesdays and get transformed by God and learn to hear his voice
 and learn how to prophesy, learn how to heal the sick and then there's an optional mission
 strip somewhere where we send you an outreach somewhere in the world. And anyway, if you have
 even the slightest interest of being touched by that. Go to this website, go to gracecenter.us/school
 and you can find out all the information about that and our application system is open. If you're
 one of our alumni, you have graduated from first year, applications for the second year of the
 school supernaturally are now open to at the same place. Go to gracener.us/school. We would love to
 to see our alumni come back for second year.
 We're super excited about second year, which focuses all on scripture and all on the
 quality of the ship that's on your life.
 Again, all the information about the school is on our school website.
 You can go there.
 But ask me what I'm excited about tomorrow.
 What are you most excited about tomorrow?
 I am most excited tomorrow about making my nerdy wall, making my calendar on the wall
 so that I can plan year one and year two together.
 Oh, yeah.
  </li><li>A hejae has special paint that you paint over a painted wall
 that turns the whole wall into a whiteboard.
  </li><li>Yeah, but it's the same color as the painted wall
 so nobody knows.
  </li><li>It's like invisible paint that you just,
 it's like a sheen that you put over it.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And then you can draw with whiteboard markers
 and it's amazing.
  </li><li>And it all wipes off, but I draw with Sharpie,
 a calendar underneath it so that I can plan
 the whole nine months of both schools.
  </li><li>Whereas I have a handheld pocket device that allows me
 See all nine months, I'll write it out on your handheld pocket device, even though you have a six plus or mega six, whatever, whatever was calling it the monster six or the big.
 But I will post on Instagram.
 Once it's finished, I'll post on Instagram.
 I can't remember my Instagram name is, I think it's just AJ Jones.
 So funny underscore AJ Jones underscore AJ Jones, but if you like nerdy things, it'll be posted.
 Closing thought for you. We you may or may not know this but we have a mailing list at our website and on aj.com
 It is a low frequency. I get enough email. I don't want to spam your inbox
 We send out maybe two emails a month where we just try and let you know ahead of time and in new articles that are being published
 You know anything that's noteworthy that we think you should know about but from time of time when we release new teaching
 we like to let everybody on our mailing list know about it beforehand and we always like to offer
 an introductory price before it goes public and we always like to throw in something free.
 If you are not on our mailing list, we'd love to encourage you go to allen and AJ.com/free
 F-R-E-E and sign up there. Again, we will not spam you. You can unsubscribe anytime you wish,
 But we're getting ready to release a new teaching set in the coming weeks.
 And for those people who are on that list, you will be able to get that teaching set at a heavily
 discounted price along with a free gift for that as well.
 So there's some homework for you.
 greycenter.us/school, alanaj.com/free.
 We hope you have an incredible week filled with the goodness and the kindness and the majesty of Jesus.
