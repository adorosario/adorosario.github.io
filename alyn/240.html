<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>AJ Jones. - Yes, sir.
  </li><li>You're a splendid Canadian beauty.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>It's episode 240.
 We are gonna be talking about being surprised
 by the power of the Holy Spirit later.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>We're gonna start with our weekly catch-up.
 Take us away on this week.
  </li><li>Oh gosh, what were we gonna talk about from this week?
 It feels like the week was went so fast,
 but it was so full.
 And I'm trying to remember what even we did this week.
 Well, we're having a just
 'cause our kids are on summer vacation.
 Yes.
 And we are not, we're still at work.
 And they want to be with us,
 even while we're in Zoom meetings and whatnot.
 So yes, it's back to the, you know,
 trying to figure out how to.
 Back, back, foul beasts, back.
 Yes, we want to cuddle you, but I'm on a Zoom call.
 Yeah, so there's that part.
 We contrasted our remote learning with three in person meetings back to back this week.
 We did.
 We had our all staff meeting, our pastors meeting, our senior team meeting.
 All in person.
 It was beautiful.
 And senior team involved toward Tia chips.
 So that's always a win.
 That's, I mean, it was a good day.
 You just to follow up from a couple of weeks ago when we were talking about, we were talking
 about vaccines, that's right.
 You went and got your antibodies checked.
 I did talk to us about your antibodies.
 I am an antibodies boss, which is exactly what your person said.
 Well, he said queen technically.
 So you should call me queen.
 You're still sky high in both.
 I'm sky high in both.
 And yeah, he actually did the test.
 I went out, I swipe my MX card and, and then he said, you know, you can
 want to run get your groceries for 15 minutes, come back and then he's sort
 laughing. We said, unless you want me to see if your short
 terms are up already, because if you have the short, you have
 the long blah blah blah. And I said, well, how likely is that?
 And he's like, well, when did you have it? I said December.
 He's like, well, let's see. And then goes in there and comes
 back and he goes, Oh, yeah, it's already a dark line. He's like,
 your body is making antibodies. You are an antibody queen.
 You are my antibody queen. That's what I want to be called from
 now on. Yep.
 So in person meetings, you go round to bodies checked.
 Anything else that you started this week?
 Yes, I started going to counseling this week.
 I was going to counseling.
 It was much better than all of my fears screamed.
 It was going to be.
 Do you know what your fear was screaming at you?
 Was it telling you a story?
 Uh, I don't know what story.
 Well, I just haven't historically felt safe because of a number of bad experiences
 with counseling that hasn't gone well.
 So I think it was a
 which just to clarify, we're talking like 20, 20 years ago,
 15 years ago, yeah, no, no, no, no, not recent, but just sort of like,
 hey, I tried that.
 It didn't turn out that great.
 I'm good.
 Me and Holy Spirit were good.
 Um, but then again, you know, if you've been watching the video
 cast or listening to the podcast, you know, last year was pretty fierce.
 I'm just a man.
 And just thought, Oh, I would love to just really be able to process in a healthy way and maybe regain some tools, that sort of thing.
 So yeah, I went to see my counselor for the first time on Monday and it was great.
 I love that you're already calling them my counselor.
 No, I went to see a counselor.
 I went to see my counselor.
 Oh, yeah.
 Yeah, I feel good.
 I feel, I left feeling like, oh, I am so glad that I made this decision, which I drove up
 going, what am I doing?
 Do I really want to do this?
 Is this really, you know, so yeah.
 Beautiful, baby.
 Yeah.
 Um, follow up from last week.
 Yes.
 You, um, well, actually know from last week, from a couple of weeks ago, you questioned
 whether English people could swim.
 Yes.
 I actually had a response from a bona fide legitimate English person.
 I mean, obviously not all English people.
 They do have Olympic swimmers, but I don't know.
 You you you.
 I wonder if they train in England just kidding.
 Sorry, go ahead.
 We have so many British people that listen or watch.
 I love you all.
 It's not personal.
 Well, Mr.
 Will said this.
 AJ Jones, Mr.
 Will British people can't swim.
 Who do you think we are?
 Our Navy conquered the known world, my dear.
 Oh, well, you did that in boats, my friend, not swimming.
 [laughter]
 Talk to us about the other--
 I've never seen Will swim, so I can't comment on Will specifically, but--
 [laughter]
 Sorry.
 But based on his bathing habits, you're deeply suspicious.
 I have some suspicions, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 One of the other big things that especially relates to your work environment is the school supernatural life
 applications are going to be closing shortly.
 Yeah.
 Talk to us about the school supernatural life.
 Okay, so this school is an eight month school,
 And I mean, if you love the podcast, you would love the school.
 We talk about the same kinds of things.
 We do have teachers come in from all over the world, but we also, Alan and I do a lot of the teaching on the school.
 And we talk about everything from like hearing God's voice and the father heart to healing and inner healing and supernatural things and seeing angels and, you know, just the sort of the whole gamut of Hey, as Kingdom believers.
 Here's some just solid foundation on a whole bunch of stuff that we can choose to walk in and we can appropriate into our walk.
 But we need to know about it first. We need to know how it works.
 And last year you did so in the history of the school, it's always been in person.
 Yes. And last year for the first time ever, it was only online and not in person.
 Yes, because of COVID.
 Yes.
 This year's what?
 This year is both.
 So we are continuing to offer it online.
 Great.
 And we are going to be back in person as well.
 So if you are local or you are looking to move,
 or you are able to get into the United States.
 Or you're able to get into the United States.
 You can come and be in this community, be at Grace Center,
 and do the school in person.
 If you are somewhere else in the world,
 or it just doesn't work with your work schedule
 to be able to do that, you want to be able to watch
 the teachings when you have time and all that kind of stuff,
 then you could do the online option.
 I'm super familiar, obviously, with the school.
 But I forget the people who are listening
 who might not know anything about the school
 might not know just the practical things,
 like how much does it run?
 Like when or what days does it run?
 You know, if I come and do it in person,
 what would it look like?
 If I do it online, what would it look like?
 In person, it looks like attending church on Sundays.
 And then you have school all day, Monday, all day, Tuesday.
 So nine to five, basically Monday and Tuesday.
 the rest of the week is your own so that you can have a job and pay your bills and you know all that kind of stuff.
 During school time you have lecture hours, you also have a small group time, we have flex sessions where you learn different things.
 Obviously you have lunch breaks and whatnot.
 Online, you get the same teaching, the same amount of teaching, but you can watch it at your own pace at home.
 And then you join us online once a week,
 depending on what year you're on,
 depends on what time it happens,
 but it'll happen on a Monday or Tuesday,
 where you have small group online,
 and you also have a, like an open session
 with whoever the speaker was who will answer questions
 and that kind of stuff.
  </li><li>So when you say that they meet on Monday and Tuesday,
 what's the time coming from an online student
 to meet on either a Monday or a Tuesday?
 It's about two hours on either a Monday or Tuesday afternoon.
 It might be like two and a half, but it's right in there.
 And when you say, hey, you can watch the week's teaching
 and your own leisure.
 Do they have to watch the teaching on a Monday and Tuesday
 of their own leisure?
 Or they can watch the teaching whenever?
 No, they get released the teaching the week before.
 So they have a whole week to watch the teaching and process it.
 And then that's part of what small group and then the live
 calls are for is to be able to both process
 with the person who taught it, or some pastors,
 or your small group leader, and your small group.
  </li><li>Having them both, I love the online experience
 and I love the in-person experience.
  </li><li>Yeah, they're both great.
  </li><li>I'm excited for it.
 When do applications close?
  </li><li>They are due to close June 15th.
  </li><li>And when does school start?
  </li><li>It starts, I think orientation is September,
 it's sometime around the seventh or eighth.
  </li><li>Okay, so it's September we kick off.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Great. Where do people go to get more information about the school?
 You would go to gracecenter.us/school.
 Very good. I'll put a link in the show notes.
 If you're interested at highly encouraged to come, I love to teach on the school.
 No matter what year we have like three different years.
 Yeah. I love teaching on all of it.
 I would love to meet you in person.
 And if you want to do it online, you get to see.
 We still get to see. Yeah. It's okay. Beautiful.
 Our main topic for this week is surprise by the power of the Holy Spirit.
 Good.
 But we're not talking about the book surprised by the power of the Holy Spirit.
 There is a phenomenal book.
 If you've never read, surprised by the power of the spirit by Dr.
 Jack Deere, I would highly encourage you to read it.
 He just re-released it actually and a new edition.
 We're not talking about that book, but going back in time when I was asking people,
 hey, if I was to write a book, what would you like to, you know, what would you read if I wrote?
 Somebody said, your version of surprise by the power of the Holy Spirit.
 What's interesting, let me just give you a synopsis of the book.
 So Dr. Jack Deere, a theology professor, a professor at Dallas Theological Seminary,
 a very, very conservative evangelical seminary.
 The whole institution is cessationist in nature.
 Sessationist, meaning that the gifts, the miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit only
 worked for a season while the apostles were alive.
 And with the closing of canon, with the apostles' death, there was no longer
 needed the supernatural ministry of the Holy Spirit.
 So today, of course, the Holy Spirit is still real, but he doesn't, you know, speaking of times,
 yeah, healings, prophecy, they're no longer for today.
 Right.
 And so that's what he preached, that's what he practiced.
 And then his book is about him encountering the Holy Spirit and him changing his theology.
 And then writing basically a theological rebuttal to the present day arguments of why
 cessationist is real and people like us are deceived.
 Fantastic book for a variety of reasons.
 Why did I do synopsis?
 I don't know.
 But you were saying we weren't, we're not actually talking about the book.
 We're not talking about the book.
 We're talking about our own experience, which is quite funny because I too was,
 well, I wasn't a theology professor, but I was a cessationist.
 I grew up in a cessationist household.
 And so somebody said, I want to hear your version of how you met the Holy Spirit.
 I think this topic's quite funny because you're cheating because surely,
 I mean, you grew up largely in the most controversial charismatic church
 on the face of the planet at the time, which was known for the miraculous power of the
 Holy Spirit. So I can't wait to hear your version of being
 surprised. I don't think you can say I grew up there. I didn't
 get there till I was like 19 or 20. So you got saved when
 when I was 15. Okay, so but your
 forward to more new age, you know, and then it
 attended a
 story. Tell me your story of how you encountered the Holy
 Spirit. Supernatural. The Holy Spirit. Just tell me your
 tell me story. Um, your story. I mean, you know, the back, the
 background being not, you know, growing up with some understanding of Christianity, but
 not that's not part of my life.
 What about like church on Easter and Sundays?
 Yeah, church on Easter Christmas.
 My because my dad was an atheist.
 My mom was an Anglican.
 And my mom wanted us to go to church every Sunday and she would go.
 But my dad wouldn't make us go because he thought it was all a bunch of
 well, words that we don't say on this podcast.
 And so the deal that they had was if we were awake and we wanted to go, then we could go.
 But if we were still asleep, he he was like, just go on your own, like don't wake them up to make them go.
 So on Sundays, you're just being a sleep.
 I would pretend to be asleep until she left.
 Um, but when we went to the cottage, uh, grandma and grandpa were also Anglican and they went every Sunday.
 And I actually really loved going to their church.
 they went to like this little sweet little church.
 And so on the weekends with Graham and Graham,
 I would go with them to church.
 But I still didn't realize that the whole thing
 was about love.
 I missed so much of what we were doing.
 I just--
  </li><li>Clearly, 'cause you didn't get saved till you were 15.
  </li><li>Right, I went and sang songs and listened to the speaker
 and internally processed, whether I agreed or didn't agree
 and just kept all of my issues and all of my anger
 and all of that.
 get saved when I'm 15, get saved,
 and start going to Baptist Church,
 which again, not a lot of room for the Holy Spirit
 to be up to anything.
  </li><li>Well, let's clarify that,
 because that's one of the contentious points
 when Charismatics talk about non-Charismatics,
 that they quote unquote, "don't have the Holy Spirit."
 And to be sure, you cannot get saved
 without the Holy Spirit's work.
 And it's not that non-Charismatics
 don't have the Holy Spirit, that's preposterous.
 How would you describe--
 We just didn't talk about him.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So.
  </li><li>You theologically believed he existed.
  </li><li>Yes, he exists, but we're not sure what he's doing really.
 You know, and he's maybe there to help you pray more
 or something, but I don't ever remember,
 you know, in four years of going to church
 every single Sunday, I don't remember hearing anything
 about the Holy Spirit.
 Like I heard about Jesus, I heard about the Father occasionally,
 he didn't sound like he was very friendly though,
 And it was mostly about Jesus.
 And so yeah, I mean, I just really didn't know anything
 about the Holy Spirit at all.
  </li><li>Do you remember the first time you encountered
 the Holy Spirit?
  </li><li>I do.
 I again, I had moved to Toronto,
 I worked vineyard Christian fellowship.
 So John and Carol's church.
 And I think really the whole reason that I wailed
 and cried that first time that I went
 was really the Holy Spirit sort of uncapping a bunch of stuff.
 But I probably-- - If you haven't heard that story,
 I'll put a link in the show notes.
 There's a couple of episodes ago,
 it was a beautiful story, I'll put a link there.
 If you haven't heard it, it's such a great story.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So you're wailing?
  </li><li>I'm wailing, I cannot, my whole life,
 I'd been able to shove everything down
 and I just couldn't.
 I mean, the presence of the Holy Spirit was so strong
 and this is before like three years
 before the revival started in Toronto.
 But I just, I could not cap the pain anymore.
 Did you know what had happened?
 Do you have like a cognitive explanation
 for what had happened?
  </li><li>No. - Like now you're saying
 of the Holy Spirit and the presence.
  </li><li>Right, 'cause now I understand.
 No, then at the time I literally inside my head
 I was like, get it together, get it together.
 What's going on?
 Like I had no clue. - Okay.
  </li><li>But I also felt this incredible safety
 at the same time as I felt like I'm most likely
 losing my mind right now.
 Like this is probably me actually having some sort
 of mental break and I'm done kind of thing.
 I didn't really know what was happening
 but they didn't seem alarmed.
  </li><li>And nobody stopped to explain this is the Holy Spirit.
  </li><li>Well, no, I was losing, I would mean I was--
  </li><li>I understand that, but in the subsequent weeks,
 when did you start having a theology for the Holy Spirit?
  </li><li>Well, okay, so then a number of months later
 was the night that I think we've also talked about
 on one of the podcasts when Mark DuPont prophesied over me
 and that whole scenario.
  </li><li>Tell that story 'cause it's so beautiful as well.
  </li><li>Okay, so I'm at, we used to do once a month,
 they would do like a area wide where they'd open up to other churches to come and it was
 a Sunday night thing and it was a potluck.
 And part of why I loved going was I got free food.
 So you know as a single person you'd bring your bag of chips or whatever and then get
 to eat like something that somebody actually made a real thing.
 And so you do that and then you go into the meeting.
 And so at this particular meeting I think I'd been going to the church maybe about six
 months at the time.
 And again, still struggling with suicides, still struggling with eating disorders, still
 just having not a good go of it, but trying to plug along as best I could.
 And so I'm sitting there with my friend Sandy, poor sweet Sandy.
 And the same Sandy that was sitting next to me when I lost it.
 How many years have passed?
 Only probably six months maybe.
 It's not that long.
 That's where we go now.
 And so Sandy was like, hey, do you want to go?
 Because I always had to drive with her.
 She had a car.
 I didn't.
 So we were sitting there and I see Mark walk in.
 And I sort of mock him because of what he's wearing.
 You don't know him at this point.
 I don't know him at all.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 And so I see him walk in and I was like, hey, check out Buddy.
 Like, who are his friends?
 You know?
 And just, you know, he had like a long red mullet and things,
 you know?
 And anyway, so I was sort of making fun of him.
 And I mean, not super loud, but, but obviously to Sandy.
 And so Sandy was like, well, that's Mark DuPont.
 And I was like, okay.
 And she said he's a prophet.
 And I was like, oh sure he is prophesy.
  </li><li>Did you have a grid for prophets?
  </li><li>No, none at all.
 So I'm thinking prophets, Old Testament.
 I haven't seen anything that leads me to believe
 that there's prophetic things happening now.
  </li><li>Was even a grid for prophetic things?
  </li><li>No, I probably wouldn't have known it if I saw it happen.
  </li><li>But you know that prophets were an Old Testament thing.
 So you're familiar with a robe, mold that's big beard.
  </li><li>Right. - Ten commandments.
 Right, shaving half your face and lying on your side.
 Yeah, I'm ready.
 You know, I mean, you know.
 Did you even know obscure things like that?
 Uh, I doubt it.
 No, okay.
 I doubt it.
 Yeah.
 I mean, I might have, at that point,
 I'd read the Bible through a couple of times.
 I really didn't understand anything.
 I really like that.
 Sure.
 He's a brothel.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Whatever.
 Anyway, he gets up and he's just speaking in the middle of speaking.
 He stops and he looks at me and he says, Sandy, who's that girl sitting next to you?
 Of course, I'm, you know, I have a fair amount of sarcasm that I was trying to,
 Well, I wasn't really trying to get healed from but I was like in my head. I was like some profite. He doesn't even know my name
 You know Sandy goes AJ and and he starts by saying
 Hey, she stand up and so I stood up and he said AJ your father's dead and he's not coming back and I was just like
 That's a nice soft opening right which he like I've never heard him give a word like that since like that sort of like
 But the thing for me was I
 I cleaned up my father's suicide.
 I knew he was dead.
 I was the one who identified his body in the morgue.
 I touched his cold hand.
 Like I knew he was gone.
 But I had managed to convince myself in the six months
 that preceded this event,
 that it wasn't true,
 that I was gonna wake up one morning
 and he was gonna be there,
 that it was all just like a nightmare.
 And I was having like all these super intense dreams
 where he would appear to me in my dreams
 and there was just all kinds of stuff going on.
 At this point, I'm also not sleeping
 'cause I haven't saw him yet.
 And I'm not really eating, I've lost a ton of weight.
 I'm really not functioning that well.
 And I had that week, I had been convinced
 that I saw my dad in the mall.
  </li><li>So you were hallucinating, right?
  </li><li>I was hallucinating.
 And so I had literally dropped whatever I was carrying
 and started running after me like,
 "Daddy, wait, wait, daddy."
 And then I ran into the bay, which is like a Macy's,
 and couldn't find him and just like dropped to the floor
 and I was bawling and they called "Mall Security"
 and what, you know.
 So nobody in that room knows that all that stuff is going on.
 And that I have basically convinced myself,
 no, he's alive.
  </li><li>So Mark's word, although it seems harsh,
 outside here is an arrow to your heart.
 Yeah.
 And immediately got my attention for somebody who was super cynical about
 Shuri is a prophet, you know, and then he just started walking through my life.
 And he didn't do it in a way that I felt uncovered.
 But basically, I mean, he was talking about, Hey, when you were seven,
 you tried to take your life.
 He didn't say in those exact words, it was more covering than that when you were 13.
 And he, you know, he went through some like key events,
 Allah word of knowledge kind of stuff.
 And then he started talking about what God wanted to do with my life.
 And so it was like, you know, the Lord wants to heal you, wants to bring your
 testimony, bring your life and bring healing to others.
 And but you actually have to give him your life.
 And the Lord says to you, if you don't want your life, why don't you give it to him
 and see what he will do with it.
 And again, what nobody in that room realized was I was planning to try and
 kill myself for the third time.
 And I was like, I will make sure it works.
 So I'd written all the letters.
 I'd written them to my aunt, to my cousin, you know,
 to my sister, like,
 'cause I thought letters are gonna make them feel better,
 you know?
 And so I was literally in the process of plotting still.
 And because of starting to go to that church,
 I had put my plot on hold,
 but I hadn't actually gotten rid of the letters.
 I was just sort of waiting to see,
 like, how's this gonna turn out, you know?
 And so when he said that, like I knew, you know, it was like, oh,
 because he said something else, very specific to that situation.
 Um,
 but gold box.
 No, he didn't.
 Well, he didn't.
 I thought he said, I know, but oh, that was your am.
 Yeah.
 Another prophetic person.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So he just said, yeah, he just said like, if you don't want your life, why don't you
 give it to God and see what he can do with it?
 I remember thinking like, dude, I can barely brush my teeth in the morning.
 Like I don't know how God would do anything with my life,
 but yeah, I don't want it.
 So if he wants it, he can have it, you know?
 Anyway, he just stopped prophesying
 and just went right back into preaching,
 like picked up the next line, you know?
 And I like sat down and I felt totally like what just happened.
 I'd never seen anybody called out like that.
 I, you know?
 And at the end of the night, he asked for it.
 Like he just said something like,
 "Hey, if you feel like there's a prophetic call on your life,
 I would love you to stand."
 And, you know, I think if you say that now probably 90%
 of the room stands, right?
 But there was about six people out of the 250 people there
 or 200 people there who stood up.
 And so he had us all step out into the aisle,
 but I didn't stand.
 I just said that I was like, I don't,
 if that's what that was, that's, wow.
  </li><li>I'm not talking about for that.
  </li><li>Yeah, not, you know.
 And he said, AJ, that's you, like stand
 and come out into the aisle.
 And so I said, no, like,
 (laughing)
 you know, the whole room's like, "Huh."
 Anyway, and he's, it's okay, you know, and I was like,
 okay, and so I came out to the aisle.
 He didn't, he didn't, he wasn't any closer than this.
 I would say he was probably a little further away,
 but he just started praying for, like, for joy
 and for life and things like that.
 And I fell over.
 And I'd never seen anybody sing in the spirit.
 So I thought--
  </li><li>You'd never seen anybody fall over
 when you were being prayed for.
  </li><li>Never. - Have you ever fallen over before?
  </li><li>No. - No.
 So I was like, and then people are leaning out of their chairs looking down at me and stretching their hands towards me or smiling.
 And I'm thinking, "Y'all call an ambulance. I can't stand up. I don't... So I have no idea what's going on. He's still praying."
 And then I start laughing.
 And you know again, this is pre revival by a good couple of years. I
 Just start literally like I'm laughing so hard and in my head
 I'm like stop it. Nothing has changed like nothing is I'm trying to think of sad things to stop myself from laughing
 I couldn't do that my face hurt my stomach hurt like I was just like
 You know and probably and I laugh loud. I mean as you know, I love your life. I'm
 I can get your full attention with my volume.
  </li><li>You can get neighborhood dogs full attention
 with your volume.
  </li><li>Okay, thanks so much.
 So anyway, I did that for about 45 minutes
 and then it stopped and then I was still lying there
 for a little bit, but I was like,
 everybody seems okay with this
 and I have no idea what's going on.
 But again, when I got up off the floor,
 never struggled with suicidal thoughts since then,
 never struggled with eating disorders again
 since that moment.
 Like it was like, the Lord did all this stuff
 that wasn't specifically mentioned, but Joy came in
 and a whole bunch of other stuff left.
  </li><li>That's a prominent encounter with a Holy Spirit.
 You've got two now within a space of six months.
 The first one, crown all over John.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Second one, that when did you start getting,
 and I wanna be clear here because you can't be born again
 without the Holy Spirit.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But I'm asking for, like when did you realize
 you were having a relationship with the Holy Spirit
 in addition to a relationship with Jesus and the Father.
 Like when did you start building a theology
 for this is who the Holy Spirit is
 and this is what he's like
 and this is how you cooperate with him
 and do you remember that journey or story or?
  </li><li>I mean, probably really not until after the revival
 started two years later.
 So I mean, I think there was,
 I could probably now look back and go,
 "Oh, the reason the room felt like that
 was the presence of God and the reason,
 the reason I decided to turn left
 instead of right and miss that accident is because, you know,
 but at the time I would have just been like, that was weird,
 or that felt so great, but not actually attributing any of the things that I would
 now attribute to the Holy Spirit.
 I remember being in YWAM and at one point,
 singing a prophetic word for like 20 minutes and not realizing,
 like now I look back and go, Oh, I was under the power of the Holy Spirit,
 singing this prophetic word. But at the time, I was just like, that was so weird, you know,
 because it just started happening. And you know, so, you know, things like that, you know,
 like hindsight, you go, Oh, this makes so much more sense of all these other things that I
 didn't have. I couldn't put a pin in understanding what it was. Right. So it really wasn't until
 after revival started. And that you then began to fill in the that I started to realize, Oh,
 If Holy Spirit did all these things, he probably also was doing all these things before and I just
 didn't realize. I love that, darling. There's a thing in business called the burden of knowledge
 in marketing, whereas a business is trying to communicate to customers, part of the way they
 get tripped up is something called the burden of knowledge. They're so familiar with their product
 or services that they make huge amounts of assumptions and they don't communicate effectively
 to customers or potential customers.
 Right.
 And I think in the church, we have so much of that too, that we are so accustomed to,
 "Oh, well, that's Holy Spirit and this is the presence of God," that we forget for some
 people it's brand new, like none of it makes sense.
 That was certainly my experience.
 Well, even things like, "Hey, go and pray about that."
 Nobody taught me how to do that.
 Everybody just assumed I knew how.
 Right.
 I think we did that a lot at church.
  </li><li>And that was largely my experience.
 I grew up as a cessationist.
 I grew up in a, very different from you,
 I grew up in a home where we valued the word of God.
 Like both my parents were first generation Christians.
 I went to church three or four times a week at services.
 We were just talking to the kids earlier about this,
 that we were a family that would do a Bible reading
 before I go to school in the morning.
 We'd have a Bible study as a family
 and as a church on Sundays,
 And I'd hear the gospel every single week.
 I remember asking the Lord Jesus in my heart.
 I remember being baptized or wanting to be baptized.
 And I remember being baptized.
 I remember, you know, door to door, witnessing, open air,
 witnessing, like that was my experience.
 There was no concept of the Holy Spirit.
 I'm sure we talked about the Holy Spirit.
 I don't ever remember it.
 The Holy Spirit was probably only there
 to help you understand the Bible.
 And the whole emphasis was the scriptures,
 which by the way, it's a beautiful emphasis.
 The word, the word, the word is beautiful.
 I love that.
 I don't think there's any error in emphasizing
 the word of God.
 And so when I met the Holy Spirit,
 I actually, because I'm such a nerd,
 I was trying to work out when I met the Holy Spirit.
 And I was like, I'm sure I've worked this out before.
 So I went through my hard drive on my computer.
  </li><li>Okay, I can't wait for what I was trying to find.
  </li><li>I found a timeline of when I met the Holy Spirit.
 and it was November 1997.
 And the reason I have this is I drew out a pictorial timeline
 for members, I'll put it in our in patrons
 so you can see it.
 I like it did this kind of like, here's my timeline,
 met Jesus and counted the Holy Spirit.
 Here's what I can trace it back to the night,
 November 1997, I don't know the date.
 It was one of the Sundays,
 so I've got like a 25% chance of being right.
 In that season of my life, I've just had,
 I've had arguably like a breakdown.
 My sympathetic nervous has shut down.
 I'm on lithium.
 I have had this like,
 Mount depressive episode.
 I'm under psychiatric care.
 I am not good.
 And one of the charismatic people in my church,
 who was so sweet and that, you know, she was lovely,
 but she invited me to her church.
 Now, as long as I'd been alive,
 my parents always taught me
 that care, is manics and Pentecostals were deceived.
 Like I remember it being taught to me,
 like, you know, these people are deceived.
 That's a cult, be very, very wary.
 You know, and so, but because I was so angry at God
 and because I was in such a broken place,
 I was like, I don't care.
 You know, I'm throwing off all these restraints.
 I'm gonna go rebel.
  </li><li>Even if they are deceived.
  </li><li>I'm gonna rebel and go to church.
 And so I go to church with Laura Wildgoos,
 now Laura Patel.
 I didn't know this until years later.
 Yeah, Laura's from Edinburgh.
  </li><li>I didn't know that.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Why didn't she
 was from Edinburgh?
 And her friend picked me up and Stephanie Jones.
  </li><li>No way. - Yes.
  </li><li>Yes, Stephanie and Laura,
 and I wish I could remember her name.
  </li><li>Okay, these are like awesome people
 that I know from doing this school in Toronto
 years and years and years later.
  </li><li>I didn't put all this together
 until years and years and years later.
 I didn't know that I'd never met Laura.
  </li><li>But I was like, I missed that, I didn't know that.
  </li><li>I'd never met Stephanie.
 My only point of contact was this girl
 that I was in university with.
 And she was super sweet and she went to this church
 So she invited me to this church.
 And so Laura and Stephanie and this girl,
 who I wish his name I could remember,
 picked me up and take me to this church.
 And it's my first,
 it's not my first experience in charismatic church.
 It was maybe my third experience of a charismatic church.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And I just thought it was nuts.
 I mean, there was people dancing
 which I'd never seen in church.
  </li><li>Any flags?
  </li><li>So many flags, so many banners.
 You know, they were using an overhead projector,
 songs I'd never even heard of, people standing, people with their hands in the air, which
 I'd seen before, but I felt so grossly uncomfortable and thought this was just ridiculous.
 But I'm having this internal conversation with the Lord, where I'm now second-guessing
 what I've done like, "Oh God, am I now in the devil's hold?"
 And yeah, I'm so...
 Even if I am, maybe a demon would be more interesting than what I've been dealing with.
 Give me a distraction.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
  </li><li>So I'm kind of like, you know, so I go there
 and the church, I don't realize the church
 has been impacted by the Toronto blessing.
 I don't even know the Toronto blessing
 is other than it's been spoken about in hushed tones
 in my family, you know, like,
 Douglas, he got that Toronto blessing.
 Like it's an affliction.
  </li><li>He caught something out, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>So I'm at his church and the guy is the pastor's preaching.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And in the middle of the middle,
 similar to Mark, in the middle of his preach,
 he stops and he looks at me and he picks me at the crowd.
 And actually, you know, the first time he's asking
 is anybody even baptized in the Holy Spirit?
 And so my friends are like,
 have you been baptized in the Holy Spirit?
 Well, that phrase is not in my vocabulary
 being baptized in the Holy Spirit.
 Despite the fact that it's a perfectly biblical phrase,
 somehow I completely missed that.
 And I'm thinking in my head, I've been baptized,
 I have been water baptized, and I have the Holy Spirit.
 So I say to them, yeah.
 And they're like, no, but have you been baptized
 in the Holy Spirit?
 And I say to them, I've been baptized,
 and I have the Holy Spirit.
 And so we have this little argument
 that they're like, just go up.
 And so I go up and the guy goes to pray for me.
 And the next thing, well, not the next thing I know,
 he prays for me and I feel like he's pushing me over.
 Actually two things happen.
 I feel like the ground is slanted
 so that I'm like losing my balance
 and I feel like he's pushing me.
 And I'm like, what the heck are you doing?
 Like, you know, why are you pushing me?
 And next thing I know, I'm on my back,
 which I'd seen some people fall down on the service,
 which ironically I was fine with.
 I didn't like the dancing and I didn't like the flag waving
 and I didn't like the, you know, people raising their hands.
 But curiously, it didn't bother me that people fell down
 because I thought that verse where Paul says,
 you know, I met no man 14 years ago
 whether in the body, how the body do not know.
 And I thought, maybe they're gonna heaven.
 That was what I jumped to.
 But here I am on the floor and I've not gone to heaven.
 I'm just like, well, that was weird.
 And I'm thinking, what's polite in these circles?
 Do I just get up and move back to my circle?
 Might my seat rather?
 Do I roll over and just commando crawl back to my seat
 so it's not to appear ungrateful?
 And that's what I do eventually.
 I just go back to my seat thinking,
 "This is such a weird church."
 And then halfway through the preaching,
 the pastor again points me out,
 I said, "You son, you really need prayer."
 And so I go out and I think,
 "Well, you got me once, you're not gonna get me again."
 So I'm like, steadfast that I am not gonna fall down.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I don't remember thinking,
 "Next thing, I'm on my back."
 And this time I am sobbing.
 You know, the big chest heaf.
 just wailing for, I don't know, half an hour, 40 minutes, I'll lose track of time.
 And now I go home that night and I'm not going home speaking in tongues, I'm not going home
 seeing angels, I'm not going home aware that anything's happened other than holy mother of
 pearl, that is one weird church. But the reason I know that November, what did I say it was,
 1997? Yes, you did. November 97. Yeah, reason I know it was November 97 was because I traced back
 everything to that night because after that, I had a hunger for worship prior to that. I never
 wanted to listen to worship music. I hated it. I started reading the Bible like I'd never read
 before. But more than that, people would come to me and be like, what has happened to you? They
 would notice a change. And of course, subsequently, I started encountering the Holy Spirit. That was
 was my first, I believe I was baptized in the Holy Spirit
 that night, but I don't know what that meant.
 In fact, I took two years to diligently study the scriptures
 and tell everybody about that experience
 'cause I thought maybe I'd been deceived.
 And if I had, I don't wanna take any of my good
 evangelicals with me.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So I just found people who were fluent enough
 in the scriptures and fluent enough with the Holy Spirit
 that I could tell, by the way, I don't mean to be divisive
 here, but I could tell with some people,
 like, do you, there's some, we're all Christians,
 but there's something different about you.
 And the first person was Douglas McCormick.
 He was, and he was a known quantity
 because he grew up in the same church circles as me,
 but he got the Toronto blessing.
  </li><li>Oh dear, yes.
  </li><li>He got affected by Toronto,
 but Douglas was an amazing teacher, a phenomenal teacher.
 But there was something about him
 that everybody could recognize
 even if we didn't have vocabulary for it,
 there is something different about him.
 He's probably one of the first
 the nine to teachers I ever heard.
 We had an anointing to teach and everyone,
 we'd love it in our church when he'd come and teach.
 And our church circles were still,
 a lot of church circles kicked Douglas out
 and didn't want anyone to do with them.
 Our church was still open to it.
 And he by and large behaved when he came to our church.
 And such a gift.
 But I would just call him and meet with him for lunch
 and just ask him so many questions,
 what about this, what about that, what about that?
 And I started reading books.
 But it was around that time that I picked up Jack Deers' book,
 surprised by the power of the Holy Spirit.
 And it was a kiss from God because Jack systematically led me through all my scriptural objections
 and explained largely what had happened to me and also introduced me to the prophetic,
 which I knew nothing about.
 And the more I began to ask the Lord for more understanding, the more he would show up.
 And I realized now, again, looking back, hindsight is beautiful, is that after that experience
 of meeting the Holy Spirit,
 that largely everything shifted for me too.
 I didn't know it at the time, but it absolutely shifted.
 And probably the two things that simultaneously happened,
 I like to think of it as a train track.
 One track was holiness, one track was gifting.
 And like the holiness was the Holy Spirit would show up
 and walk me through all my sin.
 Now, my understanding was,
 you just need to never talk about your sin.
 Just like, "Oh Jesus,
 "you're giving me all the bad stuff I've done."
 But Jesus seemed insistent and showing up and walking me through specific sins in my life,
 which I didn't talk to anybody about.
 I didn't even like thinking about myself.
 And here was the Lord asking me to, you know, like, can not relive them, but I'd have these
 theophistic moments where I would relive them and he'd walk in in the middle of them.
 Right.
 And, you know, minister to me.
 Right.
 So I hated that track.
 It produced great fruit, but it was horrible because I didn't want to revisit my
 And yet the Holy Spirit was like, "Yeah, all this stuff is..."
 That's how you deal with it though.
 It's giving you a shame hangover.
 You can't get free until... Anyway, that was one path.
 The other path was the Holy Spirit showing up in my room,
 in my bedroom with his presence, which I didn't know.
 And it took me so long to... Because I was so left brained.
 And by the way, I was so hungry for... I was so desperate,
 but I'd wait for the Holy Spirit and then think,
 "Oh, that's probably just a breeze."
 But that's probably just their conditioner.
 Oh, that's probably, you know, I would talk myself a little bit.
 But I think my hunger, my appetite, the Lord just honored that.
 And that's largely how I met the Holy Spirit.
 And I've been so slow in my understanding.
 And he's been so gracious in my understanding of him.
 Yeah, which he always is.
 I feel like there's so much more we could unpack,
 because I think for both of us, those experiences,
 those formative experiences set us on the trajectory
 that we've been on ever since.
 Right. And there's lots of other encounters and things that the Lord has done, of course.
 So many. Yeah. And I would encourage you, like, if you're listening to this,
 and maybe you haven't had some of the experiences we're talking about, but as we talk about it,
 it excites you, I would encourage you to take that passion to the Lord, like, holy spirit,
 I don't know what they're talking about. I'm not even sure if they're right, but I want more of it.
 Or if you've had experiences like that, but you realize that you haven't had them in a long time.
 Or maybe you shut it down because it was scary or yes.
 I would encourage you like ask for the Holy Spirit to open up.
 In fact, if you would let us, we'd love to pray for you right now for an impartation of the Holy Spirit.
 Go ahead.
 Do you want me to do it? Yeah.
 All right. Assume the prayer position.
 Father, Lord, I thank you for the gift of the Holy Spirit.
 I thank you for the lightness and the joy that you always carry, Holy Spirit.
 You are the most optimistic person I've ever met in my life.
 You're always full of energy.
 You're always full of passion.
 You're always full of potential.
 And you're always glad to be with me
 and glad to be with us.
 And so Lord, I'm praying right now
 that as our listeners are listening to this,
 no matter where they are on the spectrum
 of comfort with you, that you would come
 and you would give us all a fresh touch.
 Lord, that you would come right now,
 you'd begin to move on the lives of people.
 Lord, if people have never been filled
 by your precious Holy Spirit,
 I know that we can't be born again without you.
 And we also can't be filled with that.
 You and I ask Lord for everybody who's listening,
 if they don't know Jesus, that Holy Spirit,
 you would move upon their heart with conviction
 to know the Lord Jesus.
 If they do know the Lord Jesus,
 but they haven't been filled by you,
 I'm praying right now Holy Spirit from the top of their head
 to the soles of their feet that you would fill them,
 that you would come and overwhelm them,
 and that you would begin to release supernatural gifts
 on their life.
 and that they would begin to operate in a new level
 of conviction and devotion to the kingdom of God.
 And Lord, if this is wet in people's appetite, Lord,
 I pray that you would put upon their heart
 to even reach out and ask for help,
 that they would go speak to their pastor
 or they would leave us a comment,
 they would reach out Lord so that we can help equip them
 with more of you, Lord.
 I thank you that you rescued both
 and A.G. and I, our lives from the pit.
 Even though we were saved, Lord,
 even though we had a saving relationship with Jesus,
 you wanted to fill us with your Holy Spirit
 and remove from us things like depression and suicide
 and eating disorders.
 And you want to bring us the fruit of the Holy Spirit.
 Lord, you're so good at adding value to our life.
 And I ask that you would do that for everybody who's listening
 and increase in peace and boldness
 and comfort and confidence and stillness, Lord,
 and boldness and all the goodness
 that is replete with your kingdom.
 So I pray Holy Spirit,
 Would you come right now and would you fill us all?
 In Jesus name, amen.
  </li><li>Amen.
 So good.
 Do we have a listeners question?
  </li><li>Do we have a listeners question?
  </li><li>We have a listeners question.
 And actually, you know what?
 You better read it to me.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Because it's about nerdy stuff?
  </li><li>You do nerd.
  </li><li>I'll do nerd, so you ask the questions.
  </li><li>Let me just grab my glasses.
 I'll grab your glasses.
  </li><li>The Holy Spirit told me to bring my glasses down.
 I just wanna mention that.
 Another benefit of being filled with the Holy Spirit
 is you remember your reading glasses.
 All right, there's your question.
 This is a great question from Bailey,
 and it's great 'cause I get to nerd out and be a nerd.
  </li><li>Okay, so it says,
 "How do you keep your children safe
 "with access to the internet?
 "Are there apps out there that monitor screen time
 "and what your children are allowed to do on their devices?
 "My children are getting older,
 "and I have no idea how to navigate this age
 of social media and keeping my children safe.
  </li><li>All right.
  </li><li>So, Alan's our nerdy guy.
  </li><li>I'm your nerdy and I'll just tell you right now,
 the answer is yes and no.
 No, no matter what you do,
 kids are always gonna find a way around it.
 Like that I just--
  </li><li>They could, yes.
  </li><li>Well, they will.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Right, they absolutely will,
 like your passion will drive you.
 So in one sense, yeah, there's stuff you can do,
 but there's always work around.
 A much better solution would be to just speak to your children
 because here's the thing, at some point,
 you're not gonna be around when your children
 are gonna make decisions that you might not like.
 And so rather than keeping them hedged in so they can't,
 a time will come when they can,
 so just have a conversation with them about the danger.
 So this is how we've done it with our kids.
 We have sat down, in fact, just this week,
 we sat down again, this isn't the first time,
 but we bring up hard topics like,
 hey guys, as you grow up, you will meet people
 who want to see or touch your genitalia.
 And that's wrong and I hate that that's the world you're living in.
  </li><li>People or kids or you know like little friends in the neighborhood.
  </li><li>You know whatever. - You will experience that.
 And so we're just trying to get ahead of that curve and saying.
 And as our kids have got older and older and got devices,
 we've like our younger kids, we have locked down the internet
 and I'm not worried about that.
 And I'll talk to you about how I've locked that down.
 But as our children have got their own cell phones,
 here's the thing, it's really easy for me to lock things down in my house.
 Every cell phone has a wireless chip.
 And so when my kids go out of the house
 with a cellular enabled device, they can bypass,
 or not bypass, there's no safeguards there for them.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Or they could borrow their friend's phone,
 whose parents might not be as tech savvy as me and use it.
 So I've just explained to my kids,
 hey, like this is what's gonna happen on the internet.
 There's stuff called pornography,
 and I've explained to them what pornography is
 and why it's dangerous.
 Like we've just had those conversations
 to educate them like why this is what you don't want to do.
 So with anything I say next will be pointless
 if you haven't had those conversations
 and they're awkward conversations.
 Also, I would also say any conversation you have
 that if you don't model the same behavior for them,
 they're largely gonna watch what you do more than they're
 gonna listen to what you say.
  </li><li>Yeah, absolutely.
  </li><li>So with that in mind begins the nerdy thing.
 If you're using iOS devices, I can help you.
 If you're using any other devices by iOS,
 I mean an Apple iPhone or an Apple iPad or an Apple laptop or an Apple computer.
 Apple has something called screen time.
 Screen time will send you a weekly report of what apps,
 how long your kids have been on their phone, what they've been doing.
 We've taken the unusual step, I say unusual because most parents, we know
 don't do this.
 We have put zero limitations on our kids using their devices.
 I'm deeply suspicious of the quote unquote research about the effects of
 screen time because screen time is such a nebulous term.
 Like screen time playing mindless video games, screen time, reading books,
 screen time, screen time, doing creative work.
 Yeah.
 So yeah, like our girls do everything from, well, one of, I mean, Abby does all of
 her drawing on her screen.
 All of her animation, all of her on her screen.
 And and Tia does all of her reading is, you know, on her screen.
 So so we haven't put any screen limitations on our kids.
 We, you know, encourage them to go outside, like they've been outside all day today.
  </li><li>Making money.
  </li><li>But we don't do that.
 The other thing about screen time
 is that it allows you to put content restrictions.
 So we have bolted down on all of their devices.
 Actually, we've bolted down the internet.
 They can't access anything on the internet
 unless we approve it.
 And so if they need to access a website,
 we just come, we put it in a code
 and it remembers that website.
 That's, there's a lot of friction initially,
 but they don't have access to any websites.
 And that works by the way, out of the house
 or in the house.
  </li><li>And they can't download new apps
 that we haven't checked out first.
  </li><li>And as we download, we get a notification.
 So that's kind of how we've done that.
 We also use something called Eero.
 Eero is our Wi-Fi router system in our house.
 But Eero, on top of the hardware devices,
 they sell something called Eero Plus, Eero Secure,
 I think it is.
 And it's like $99 a year,
 but you can put filters on everything.
 So it filters Google searches, Bing searches,
 it blocks content at a Wi-Fi level.
 So even if they borrow somebody else's device
 that isn't locked down, if they're here,
 they can't access any of that stuff.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Trying to think of what else we do.
 That's it, oh, our 14 year old has an Instagram account.
 And we just said, hey, here's what's gonna happen.
 As soon as you get an Instagram account,
 creepy people are gonna try and friend you.
 So make your account private.
 If anybody ever asks you anything
 that makes you feel uncomfortable, tell us.
 We've said to all our kids,
 hey, you've got these devices, they've got cameras.
 Never, under any circumstances,
 take a photo of yourself naked.
 Like we're just up and told them.
 Now you might be thinking,
 "Shouldn't that be obvious?"
  </li><li>I don't know. - It's not.
  </li><li>I ended up doing a bunch of dumb stuff as a kid.
 And now as an adult, I was like, "Well, that was obvious,
 "but we just try and be as blunt and as frank as possible."
 And we've also said, "If anybody ever sends you
 "a picture of them naked, you tell us immediately,
 "don't delete it, just come and tell us immediately
 "so we can help you with that."
 So we-- - Yeah.
 But that's kind of an extension of how we parent.
 We've tried to--
 Yeah, we do talk to them about everything.
 And in the hopes that also, as they grow up,
 they're gonna come and talk to us
 about whatever they need to talk to us about.
 So we try and make sure that no matter what we're talking
 about, that it doesn't feel awkward,
 that it doesn't feel judgmental,
 that it's just like, hey, because we love you,
 we want you to be aware of the potential of this.
 And here's some things that we would really love you
 to not do, and there's reasons for that,
 and they are this, you know, so yeah.
  </li><li>So I hope that's helpful.
 I'll put all the links to the products I talked about in the show notes so you can reference them.
 Bailey, but thank you for asking that question.
 And if you'd like to ask us a question, you can go to allen and aj.com/ask to ask us a question.
 I was very Canadian.
 Allenaj.com.
 You did a Canadian A.
 I did.
 Yeah, it was very funny, very sweet.
 I want to read you something.
 I don't think I've read this.
 I am Canadian still, by the way.
 I mean, I'm American as well.
 But I was born a Canadian.
 Pick your side in there.
 We go to war.
 Who are you going to?
 So hard.
 Let's not even think about that.
 Yeah.
 OK, I want to read you something.
 Yes.
 This is this is encouragement about the podcast we did a couple of weeks ago about COVID.
 OK.
 But the reason I'm reading to you is it's something also really sweet.
 So you haven't heard this.
 This is from Shannon.
 She wrote us and she said this, even though I work in the medical field and my
 mother is constantly sending me anti-COVID vaccine articles and I'm just so over COVID.
 This episode still managed to keep me entirely engaged.
 And it's because it's not so much that I care about COVID talk,
 but that I love listening to you guys process about life, whatever the topic.
 Specifically, it's very helpful to watch you two interact.
 Last week, this was a couple of weeks ago now,
 last week was so lovely to watch AJ process and Alan responded in real time
 to hearing some stuff for the first time.
 time. Some of what you guys talk about is incredibly vulnerable and it's real.
 Thank you for the realness. Now I read that because in the same week I got so
 much feedback from our members about, "Hey I love the podcast but there's
 something precious about being able to watch the podcast." And if you're a
 regular listener you've heard us harp on about like, "Hey if you only listen to
 the podcast you're getting half of the show." But based on the feedback that we're
 getting people are saying, "Hey there's something beautiful about watching you
 guys interact. If you want to get a little sampler for what those videos are like, we
 have a YouTube channel, YouTube.com/allonaj, where you can watch an example, you know, of
 some of the footage. But I'd encourage you, if you want to be like Shannon, if you want
 to be moved and touched by watching the interaction that happens, then become a member. If you
 go to allonanaj.com/join, you can learn all about the benefits of becoming a membership.
 Chief among them is getting access to the video podcast.
 And so we've had some members say,
 oh, I listened to the podcast like normal.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I come home and watch it, you know, as well.
 And you know, when you use like a nice podcast client,
 not Spotify, is most podcast clients allow you
 to have chapter support.
 So you have a drop down menu of what we're talking about.
 We do that on the video too.
 So if there's bits of the video that you wanna watch,
 our video is chapped,
 can just jump to the bits that you like. There you go. And finally, if you want the show notes,
 you can go to allen and AJ.com/240. Bye bye.
