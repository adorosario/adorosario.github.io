<p> Abby Tia and MJ, no parents today.<br/>
 The most wonderful show is Keeping up with the Joneses.
<strong>[MUSIC]</strong><br/>
 Welcome to the special edition of Keeping up with the Joneses,
 and Keeping up with the Kids.<br/>
 My name is Tia.<br/>
 My name is Abigail.<br/>
 I'm my good darling.<br/>
 I have some questions for you about Thanksgiving.
 Can you tell me what Thanksgiving is about?
 Ahhh, Jesus.<br/>
 It's Thanksgiving's about Jesus, is it?
 Yeah.<br/>
 Did you have a special Thanksgiving lunch today?
 Yeah.<br/>
 Were you a pilgrim or were you an Indian?
 Uh, Indian.<br/>
 Okay, I think you were a pilgrim, technically.
 It's about spending time with the family
 and remembering the forced time of Thanksgiving
 when the pilgrims and the Americans met.
 Oh, really? And what did they do?<br/>
 Did they play Wii? Did they have Starbucks? What did they do the first time they met?
 They had a big feast like we do now.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 They had different things and then we do have now. They both had chukki.
 Oh, I love turkey. Do you have turkey?
 The pilgrims went on the Mayflower to start a new life.
 And where did the pilgrims come from?<br/>
 England.<br/>
 So it's kind of like daddy leaving.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 Come into America, the final new life.
 Did you know the Mayflower was actually a ship?
 I did not know the Mayflower was a ship.
 And you did not have privacy when you pooed.
 Pheel.<br/>
 Pheel.<br/>
 Why?<br/>
 No door.<br/>
 Oh, okay.<br/>
 Today I will be singing my country Tizzafy.
 Okay, what's the song called?<br/>
 My country Tizzafy.<br/>
 Tizzafy?<br/>
 What's a fee?<br/>
 I don't know.<br/>
 Okay, sing it for me baby from the top.
 My country tears a fee, sweet friend of the pussy of the ashes.
 Rind all my fathers die, rind all the pilgrims from every mountainside.
 Let the freedom ring.<br/>
 So from our family to your family have an incredible Thanksgiving and we'll be back with regular programming next week.
 Happy Thanksgiving!<br/>
 Faith, Life, Communication, Tacos and Video Games
 Paleo-domuts and the kindness of God<br/>
 But things we deal with every day<br/>
 From Franklin, Tennessee<br/>
 They are just like you and me<br/>
 Alan, and AJ<br/>
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 Sharing their life, experience it<br/>
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 They talk about faith in God and everything under the sun
 If you are a human being, there's something here for everyone
