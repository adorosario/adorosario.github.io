<p> I'll in an age is got for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to episode one sixty eight of keeping up with the Joneses.
 This week we're talking about keys to loving well and how to communicate your need for love in order to keep your relationships vibrant.
 Baby sounds so good on the intro.<br/>
 Thanks.<br/>
 I want to keep our relationship vibrant.
 Okay.<br/>
 Can you teach me some keys?<br/>
 Sure.<br/>
 But first the weekly catch up.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Let's face facts.<br/>
 There is one event that eclipses all the other events from this week.
 Yes, my chicken dinner.<br/>
 It was so good.<br/>
 Oh, that's not what you meant.<br/>
 Don't play coy with me.<br/>
 Yes, folks.<br/>
 Here's the thing.<br/>
 We went camping.<br/>
 I'm assuming people really have much of a big deal that is.
 I think if they listened to our podcast for a while or have listened to any back
 episodes, they would realize.<br/>
 that you were not exactly in love with the idea of camping.
</p><ul>
  <li>And it was mostly because camping takes place outside.
  </li><li>Yes, it's tricky that way.
  </li><li>And it's not that I don't necessarily like the outdoors.
 It's that I don't necessarily like the outdoors.
 (laughs)
 No, it's not necessarily the outdoors that's the problem.
 It's everything that comes with it.
 Like the unpredictability of the humidity, the bugs,
 the dirt, the lack of air conditioning, that sort of stuff.
 Yeah. And also in Tennessee, it's hot and humid.
 It is. Which isn't pleasant.
 Yes. But it's so fun. And, and I think on this trip, you tapped into the fun of it.
 You know, the revelation I had was, I remember once when I was a kid and I was walking home from school
 and it was raining and I was wearing a wool blazer because we had school uniforms.
 Yeah. And it's, you know, if it's raining, you're trying to keep yourself dry,
 but you eventually reach an inflection point when it's, it's pointless trying to keep yourself dry.
 You may as well embrace the fact that you're wet.
 And I remember just sitting in puddles and jumping in puddles bear mind of the little kid at this point and suddenly being soaking wet became fun.
 I realize that camping is a bit like that that the efforts to not get dirty grubby or grimy is pointless and once you accept that you can just embrace the dirt the smell the grubiness yes and there is a refreshing rewardingness to it.
 It's true i mean just think we got there the kids ran around and played an mj at seven thirty was begging to go to bed he was so tired i can understand it i came home from one night of camping one measly night of camping.
 And we got home about what midday and i had to have an app yeah and that didn't help because when i woke up.
 i just felt like i've been hit by a sledgehammer and then last night we slept so hard that actually i woke up in the night realizing that there was hair in my face.
 And it was mj's head at some point i had.
 Let him in under the covers let him snuggle up with me and i didn't remember any of it so you just woke up to a child to to hear in my face.
 I was like buddy what are you doing that because i told you i had a dream.
 I was like, oh my gosh.
 And I was exhausted.
 I have no memory of that happening at all.
 So I walked him back upstairs and bribed him to stay in bed.
 And then I came back down and went back to sleep.
 So yeah, we weren't camping.
 I don't think we're making a big enough deal of this.
 It was a big deal, folks.
 It's a big deal.
 It was made possible by some friends of ours who have been camping many, many times,
 especially at this location.
 Yes.
 And so they knew what they were doing and they hooked us up.
 They advised us correctly and thoroughly.
 And in my defense, my vision of camping was not what this weekend was like.
 Hell, I thought camping was you put a backpack on your back and you load it up with heavy stuff,
 and then you trudge unnecessarily into the wilderness without a car, and you just hike,
 and then you find somewhere to lay down, and then you build a tent and build a fire,
 and then you kind of sleep, and you just kind of muscle through, and then you come home.
 Well, that's kind of the camping I did in Canada.
 right so that's what i thought we're gonna be doing i didn't realize we're going to be driving to a very beautiful state park yes where there are camp.
 Yes i can't ground i mean you pre book a lot that has a level concrete pad built into the side of the forest and so that's there and there's these nine little lots and we had how many families with us one two three four of us total and it was just lovely because you're in the literally.
 literally in the middle of forest, but 15 seconds to your right is civilization.
 There's a giant Wi-Fi antenna out of the park and there's bathrooms, a two-minute walkaway.
 I was like, "I could do this.
 This is great."
 But you had a proper place to put your tent and proper fire.
 Yeah, there was level campgrounds.
 We only had to walk in maybe 100 meters or something to our site with all of our stuff.
 Right.
 It was amazing.
 I thoroughly enjoyed it.
 enjoyed it. I had to convince her to do because everybody thought I was just being polite.
 I should probably nobody thought I was being polite. I don't know what they were thinking,
 but lots of people were like, you really are having a good time. I was like, yeah, I'm genuinely
 having a good time. Such a good time in fact that we're going to do again.
 Yes, we are. So anyway, I loved it. What did you think? Because, you know, we'll get to
 why this happened later when we talk about loving well, but what did you think?
 I, what did I think? I was super stressed before we went that you weren't going to like it.
 Because we bought a tent and everything to be able to go.
 Yeah, we sunk a chunk of money into this.
 Yeah. So I was like, oh, you know, but I was like, okay, you know, this is something I've
 always wanted to do and I've wanted to take our kids. And so I was nervous beforehand.
 But actually once we got there and you totally got into it, I felt totally fine.
 I think the thing for me is every time I told somebody in the coming weeks that I was going
 camping, everybody, universally, every single person said, I love camping as a child, or
 my favorite memories of childhood were camping. It doesn't matter whether I spoke to older
 people, younger people, every said the same thing. And then when I spoke to parents or
 grandparents, they were all like, we love taking our kids camping. We just loved it.
 And I can totally see why. I think I was freaking people out when I said that. But I totally
 got it. I totally understood why you would go camping. Now, if you're again, we didn't
 have rain, nothing went wrong. Nobody was injured. We were surrounded by lots of people
 we love. Tia, mine really injured herself. She seems to have a thing right now where
 she's injuring herself like every day in some minor way. I'm like, I rolled my ankle,
 but you know, I'm a strong, confident man. And I just kind of pushed through the pain
 It was amazing. Almost like Captain America.
 Yeah.
 You're not the first person to draw that similarity bit.
 Okay.
 So I loved it. Yeah. It was amazing. Is it worth talking about my breakfast bonanza?
 Well, first, can I just tell you the sweet thing that MJ said?
 Yes.
 So Saturday morning, we're lying there and it's like 6.30 in the morning. Alan and I
 haven't made any noise yet. So the kids are quiet until we are like, okay, it's time to
 to get up, you know?
 So I hear MJ, obviously Abby's eyes are open and he goes,
 "Abby," she says, "Yeah, do you like camping?"
 She said, "I do like camping."
 He said, "I love it."
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>It was so sweet.
 I was like, "Okay, worth it for just that."
  </li><li>Well, again, like I said,
 we put a couple of hundred dollars into this thing
 and I was thinking, "I hope we like this
 "because otherwise this has been a waste."
  </li><li>Otherwise we're gonna have to sell a bit.
 So it's not nearly new.
 Eight person 10 only used once we hate camping camp.
 Yeah.
 So yeah, I love it.
 But the town we got is so cool, isn't it?
 It goes up.
 It took us two minutes.
 They say it goes up in 60 seconds, but I would say it went up in two minutes.
 Oh, easily.
 Yeah.
 And next time I'm sure we could do it in a minute because we actually because we'll
 know what we're doing.
 Yeah.
 But yeah, we we hooked up.
 So now admittedly, I've been diverting my intention into what other ways
 Can we make the camping experience better?
 Well, we need like a little string of lights for our campsite.
 You see, you're thinking about string lights.
 I'm thinking getting rid of air mattresses because that's an exercise in
 in weirdness and gravity and moving to cloths. You mean?
 Oh, yeah. Yeah.
 So here's this thing.
 I didn't realize car camping was a thing.
 Yeah. I thought camping was carrying stuff on the backpack, but loading stuff
 into a car and then driving somewhere.
 I'm up for it. Yeah.
 Well, here's the thing.
 Like the kind of camping I used to do before, which is portaging.
 is not card camping. It's load everything on your back and only what's on your back comes with you.
 Right. See, it's not going to end and all that kind of stuff, but I'm not going to do that.
 Kids. I mean, I know Alison Hendrickson had her eight month old strapped to her back and they brought,
 I was like, you guys are legit and Marcus was out there with. Samuel's up through the night in like
 a baby caught. Yeah. You'd be in having appreciation for your friends when you're like, wow, you have
 some unique skills. I did not know that you had that. Matt Hale's swinging around as a machete.
 Yeah. We saw serious man skills going on this weekend, yeah.
 Which leads me to my breakfast. Yes. Go ahead, babe. We were making bacon on the grill.
 Who was making bacon on the grill? I was. Yes, you were. Yeah. We had tin foil out and we're
 cooking some bacon. And I noticed all the bacon. We should say on the grill is over the fire.
 So it's tin foil over fire on the grill.
 I just want to clarify.
 It wasn't like we brought a grill into the forest with us.
 You actually did the manly thing and.
 Well, I didn't because Marcus got the wood and I think you made the fire.
 Yeah.
 And then Chris gave us the tin foil.
 So basically I put out some raw bacon and let heat do things.
 So it's a bit generous to say that I cooked the bacon.
 You supervised the bacon.
 Sure.
 Yeah.
 So as I'm supervising the bacon, I'm realizing, oh, like there's just,
 there's like a pool of bacon fat.
 I'm thinking this bacon is pretty delicious, but I'm pretty sure if I
 basted a marshmallow in that bacon grease and fried it, it will be delicious.
 And so that's what I did.
 I stick this giant marshmallow.
 I I basted it in the bacon fat shoved it in the fire, which I thought it would
 just catch fire, but it didn't.
 It instantly crisped up that marshmallow while warming on the inside.
 Then I got that marshmallow and wrapped it in one of the slices of bacon and then put that between two of your banana chocolate chip pancakes.
 I just want to say they were gluten free.
 Yeah, like that's the great reason.
 That's going to be the redemption.
 And it was marvelous.
 Really?
 It was marvelous.
 Well, it must have been good because I walked Tia to the bathroom and back and I wasn't gone for longer than like six minutes and it was gone, I completely gone.
 Well, of course, anybody can eat a pancake in six minutes.
 That's not an indication of awesomeness.
 But it wasn't just a pancake.
 It was like a mountainous.
 You should post a picture of it.
 I oppose the picture.
 It was pretty fantastic as what it was.
 So there you go.
 The world didn't come to an end.
 I left the house.
 I actually went into the great outdoors.
 I thoroughly enjoyed it.
 I'm now making a list of state parks that we can go visit.
 And we didn't do devices for the whole time we were away.
 No, we took the iPads and the kids were left to use the iPads on the way there.
 and on the iPads on the way home and I brought Nintendo switch because I don't know how bored I was going to get.
 I didn't use it the whole time.
 Yeah, I only use my iPhone to post Instagram.
 Yeah.
 And you know, use my drone, of course, but doesn't even count as technology.
 I don't think it does.
 No, it's like having your own bird.
 Yeah.
 Yes.
 That's like you brought your own hawk out into nature.
 Let's just go with that.
 Let's give it a half like name and then nobody will ever know it's a drone.
 You are a.
 you wonder tonight that lady hot
 you're banned from naming gadgets
 that
 i'm going to be a lady hot
 i feel like a bit
 to grab a big
 it's gonna be great
 how much you have to drink
 i've only had the great
 the car is is pure tiredness
 okay period at a
 yeah let's talk about our main topic for this week
 which is all about loving well
 yeah
 This topic actually came out of a conversation we had with our kids.
 Or actually I had with our kids.
 You were away.
 When were you away?
 You were away a couple of weekends ago, a ministering at a women's conference.
 Yeah.
 And I had the kids and I had stacked a day full of things to do.
 And on the way back from the movie theater, we have a couple of
 we went to see it doesn't matter.
 But I'm driving home and they said, we're going to do next.
 I said, we're going to tidy the house.
 And they said, why?
 Which is somewhat scary.
 Why would we do that horrible thing?
 And I explained what mommy feels really loved when the house is tidy and they asked me to expand on that topic.
 So I introduced a concept of love tanks to them, which immediately confused MJ because he thought about military tanks,
 not like tanks that you would hold liquid in.
 So I had to change it from tanks to containers.
 Oh, good. Good decision.
 And I said, you know, all of us have a container that we store love in and that container, you can get filled up with love by friends.
 and family. And each of us have a preference for what that container gets filled with.
 Or how it gets filled or whatever.
 Exactly. So they were like, "So why does Tylen and the house make Mummy feel loved?"
 And I said, "Well, Mummy is acts of service." Now, if you have read the five love languages,
 you're going to be very familiar with this. But this is a primer on a brilliant book written by
 Gary Chapman called Five Love Languages. And basically, the premise is there are five different
 ways that we feel loved. And so I explained this to our kids. I said, you know, there's
 receiving gifts and they're like, oh yeah, yeah, we like receiving gifts. That makes us feel loved.
 There's quality time spending time with one another. There's acts of service doing things for people.
 There's physical touch, which is like hugs and kisses, and there's words of affirmation.
 And so then they all took time in working out how they felt loved and began expressing it. And so
 universally, they all said that they were gifts, they were quality time, and they were physical
 touch. And I was lovely just watching them realize, oh, this is how I feel loved. And
 then they said to me, well, how do you feel loved, daddy? And I said, well, I'm words
 of affirmation. Like I like it when people say kind things to me, and people are grateful
 for the things I do for them. And I said, I'm physical touch, I love the hugs and kisses.
 And they're like, is that why you hugging kisses all the time?
 And I'm like, yes, yes, it is.
 But what was sweet was after I told them that I noticed they all weekend,
 they constantly were thanking me.
 Daddy, thank you for taking some movie theater.
 Daddy, thank you for gifts.
 Daddy, thank you for spending time with us.
 Daddy, thank you for making dinner.
 I was like, you sweet little monkeys.
 Yeah.
 And it worked like I could feel my love tank getting full with that.
 This is a funny thing about it.
 It seems such a simple concept.
 It almost feels demeaning to reduce love
 to these five practical activities.
 I remember the first time I read the book,
 there was major eye rules.
 Oh, please, seriously, this doesn't work on me,
 but it absolutely works.
 So what are you?
  </li><li>The last time I tested, which was a year ago,
 I was evenly between gifts and acts of service
 as my first.
 And then my second was quality time.
  </li><li>Doesn't surprise me, at all.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So when you help me, when the kids help me,
 when anybody helps me do anything,
 totally fills my left hand.
  </li><li>Or when we do things for you.
  </li><li>Or if you do things for me, yeah.
 So when I came home from that women's weekend
 and I know what the house looked like when I left,
 like it was a disaster.
 And so I'm coming home literally thinking
 he's had the kids for the last three days.
 There's no way he's had a chance to get anything clean.
 It's funny, I didn't look at the Nascam, which is probably like just the Lord
 keeping me from remembering the look, you know, right, but I just didn't check it.
 For those of you who don't know what Nascam is, we have cameras in our house
 made by a company called Nast.
 So it allows us to see what's going on in and outside the house.
 So age is saying she could have checked in at any point and saw the kids
 and see what was happening, but you didn't.
 I didn't.
 And so I came home and everything was spotless.
 And my kids were bad thing clean and in bed and everything.
 And I just put personal tears.
 I just, I was like, Oh, wow, like you hit it out of the park.
 And what's lovely about these tools is you can instantly use them and see a return on your investment.
 So because I'm high words of affirmation, I mistakenly assume everybody's high words of affirmation.
 So I'm just like, Oh, I love you.
 Oh, you're amazing.
 And it's not that you don't like being told that you're loved.
 But it doesn't do anywhere near the filling of your love tank as it was to see the house tidy in the kids' bath.
 Right. That would be like, if you want to think about it in terms of like a faucet, that would be like a slow trickle where,
 you know, coming home to a clean house and the kids being bath was like a fire hose.
 Right. That's a good way of putting it.
 Yeah. So if you're filling my tank, that's a faster way to fill it than there's a whole bunch of words of affirmation that would have to happen before I'd register anything.
 Right. And you'd probably not hear the words of affirmation because you're looking at the house, which is an absolute mess.
 Yes, true.
 The thing I loved was watching a 10, 8, and 4-year-old understand how powerful knowing your love language is.
 Like, it was amazing watching them identify how they feel loved and then recognize the intention of our parenting.
 So they were like, "Daddy, did you take us as a movie theater because you want to spend time with us?"
 And I said, "Yeah, I did."
 And they said, did you play video games with us because you want to spend time with it?
 Yeah. And you could see the cogs turning like, oh, yeah, that's what love is.
 This is, you know, this is what feeds me, which is, which is amazing.
 Yeah. And of course, I mean, I don't know if all little kids are gifts,
 but certainly all three of ours are at this point.
 And it can be anything.
 It can be anything. It can be a $2 gift. It can be, yeah, literally
 tic-tacs or like a, you know, spongy head or, you know, whatever.
 What's a spongy head?
 Well, like they're called mashums.
 They like these squishy head things.
 MJ is all about them.
 Okay.
 You know, and I mean, it's not about the cost.
 It's about, I thought of you and I knew you liked this.
 Right.
 So growing up, one of the most amazing memories
 I have for my childhood, because growing up,
 we got gifts on Christmas and we got gifts on our birthdays
 and nothing ever.
 Right.
 Occasionally, and by occasionally, I mean, maybe every once a month, my dad would come home,
 maybe on the last Thursday with a chocolate bar for each of us.
 And that was like, eh, I think it was great, don't get me wrong, we love chocolate.
 But I remember one day being in John Menzies, which was, it was a toy store, it had toys.
 And I remember being in there, I remember holding my dad's hand.
 I can't remember how old I would be, I could look it up, because it was the return of the
 jet I had just come out.
 And I'm looking at this wall of Star Wars figures.
 And as I'm looking at this wall of Star Wars figures, my father unprompted says, "Would
 you like a Star Wars figure?"
 And I just about passed out because I was like, "It's not my birthday and it's not Christmas."
 And my dad said, "You can pick any Star Wars figure you want."
 And I remember just thinking, "Pick a Star Wars figure before..."
 Before it changes its mind.
 I don't know what loophole I found, but quickly pick it.
 Don't question it.
 And it was so shocking to me.
 I just remember being so shocked.
 And it wasn't until actually I was grown up
 and went to stay with my sister,
 Keras, Keras and Ben, my brother-in-law,
 who live in North Carolina.
 I remember being over with them,
 and I remember Ben had bought his kids some gifts,
 and I remember like, just tilting my head going,
 but it's not their birthdays.
 Again, I'm a grown adult.
 This was maybe like four or five years ago.
 thinking, not thinking why you buying your kids a gift, but just thinking, wait, you're
 allowed to buy, like that's a thing. You can buy gifts when it's not a birthday or a,
 and having that realization, like, yeah, it's, it's actually okay to do that. You can bring
 joy and delight to people. Yeah. Which must have sucked for you as a, you know, gift-giver.
 Wait, what do you mean it must have sucked for me?
 Well, my revelation that you can buy gifts anytime you want to tell something you love
 Because I tended to reserve all my gifts for your birthday or for your Christmas.
 Yeah.
 And I like to think I did quite well.
 You did.
 You did great birthdays and Christmas.
 But it just never occurred to me throughout the year that I could buy you gifts.
 No, and I'm not like, even though I'm a gifts person, I'm not a flowers person.
 So like, I remember a couple times you brought flowers when we first got married.
 And I think because flowers remind me of funerals and flowers die and usually,
 I'm just waiting for them to die so that I can throw them out because they're making a mess on my counter or whatever.
 You stopped bringing flowers, which is great.
 But you never told me, babe, I hate flowers.
 Well, I did.
 And then I never bought them again.
 But you did bring flowers home for Abbie and Tia because they love flowers.
 Right.
 So we have flowers occasionally because the girls like them.
 There was something that Bill Johnson does that I was really inspired by.
 inspired by on his birthday, he loves to buy his kids and his grandkids now, presents.
 Yeah, that's amazing.
 And I remember thinking, "Oh, I want to do that."
 So this year, I decided to do that.
 This year my birthday, I bought you a gift and I bought each of the kids a gift.
 You did.
 And I thought, "That's a great tradition.
 I'm going to start doing that because, well primarily because you're a gift-giving person."
 Yeah, I liked my gift.
 Do you want to tell us what your love languages are?
  </li><li>Mine are simple, minor words of affirmation
 and physical touch.
 Basically, I just want you to lie on top of me
 and tell me I'm awesome.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's pretty much right.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>At this point, it's worth noting that
 everybody's tank drains at a different speed.
 So in terms of quality time for me,
 I have a very slow leak on quality time.
 What I mean is I could have one date with you,
 I could spend quality time with you
 and it would last me, I know, months.
 Like it's just a slow drain on my need to connect.
 But in terms of physical touch,
 I want physical touch like every 15, 20 minutes.
  </li><li>Yeah, probably.
  </li><li>Just a kiss, a hand hold, a cuddle.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>What's funny is when we're in bed asleep,
 you do not like to be touched.
  </li><li>I do not.
 I do not.
  </li><li>I wanna fall asleep.
  </li><li>I was just like, now that we're sleeping, don't touch me.
  </li><li>But I wanna fall asleep snuggling.
 And you're like, "Ugh, this is horrible."
  </li><li>It's like being strapped to a heater.
 I just know.
 I wonder if some of it is because my body doesn't regulate heat very well.
 Like I don't sweat and once I get hot, I can't get unhot.
 Like I just, I just have trouble.
 So I just want to be able to regulate, regulate my heat without you messing with it.
 But your need for quality time is quite high.
 Yeah.
 But your need for gifts isn't as high.
 For example, I can buy you a gift and that gift will keep that love tank
 quite full.
 Yes.
 Whereas you need a date every single week.
 You need some form of quality time that you can look forward to every single week.
 Yes.
 But your gifts, I don't know, like every month, every couple of months, depending on what
 the gift is.
 But honestly, I would say probably acts of service drains the fastest.
 Really?
 Yeah.
 That's interesting.
 Yeah.
 I've only just recently noticed that actually where I'm like, "Oh, you haven't helped me in
 a while."
 Or, you know, whatever.
 I noticed that now.
 Well, let's talk about that because the other thing that's interesting that we would have
 conflict in is actually the person who's receiving the gift gets to determine how they receive
 the gift.
 Yes.
 So what I mean is you're saying your access service and you're saying, hey, it drains
 quickly going, hey, you haven't helped me.
 And our conflict would be, are you freaking kidding me?
 Like, I'm doing her taxes or I've been doing yard work or I'm editing the podcast.
 And that hasn't filled your love tank because even though those are acts of service, they're
 not the things you want served in.
 Right.
 They're not the things that are helping me or like, I don't feel helped by them immediately.
 Yes.
 And that would be confusing.
 Yeah.
 Because, because it'd be like, wait, well, hang, hang, hang about.
 So it's important to not only understand your love language, but also understand the nuances
 of that love language.
 Like, like how it gets filled.
 For example, receiving gifts, most people who love their love language is receiving gifts.
 It doesn't have to be a wildly expensive gift, but it does have to be an appropriate gift
 for that person.
 Yeah, it has to be a gift that says, "I know you."
 It's not just any gift.
 Any gift, actually, just any gift is almost offensive.
 My family kind of has a track record of giving really bad gifts, and their whole thing is,
 what's your problem? Yeah.
 But you gave me a bobblehead Jesus and dot matrix paper.
 Like this isn't a gift.
 This is something else.
 This communicates.
 I don't know you at all.
 And I didn't really care enough to think about it.
 But for example, but you could have actually brought me a crunchy bar and that would have been better.
 Or if I come back from the store and I have a blackberry is he for you,
 that's going to speak volumes to you.
 Right.
 But if I bring home a diet mountain dew, you're going to be like, are you trying to kill me?
 Right.
 And I could be like, but what?
 They're both fizzy drinks.
  </li><li>Right. - I thought you liked fizzy drinks.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And that's where I got caught up.
 Like I think I went into analysis paralysis for years
 'cause I wouldn't wanna buy you a gift that was wrong.
 And you had to help me go, no, the gift I want
 doesn't have to be expensive.
 It just has to say, you were thinking of me and you know me.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
 And also I realized like when you talk about,
 we were talking just a few minutes ago about,
 you know, your burn on in terms of,
 well, you're doing the taxes or you're doing whatever.
 Like I would try and logic my mind into,
 like I know you're doing the taxes
 and I know you're doing the podcast, you know,
 and I'd be like, just feel happy with that.
 Like just feel loved by that.
 But it's like it's not a mind-over-matter thing.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So I can totally feel thankful
 that you're doing the taxes
 or you're doing the podcast and I do.
 but it doesn't fill my love tank.
  </li><li>And what I didn't realize is if I stop doing
 what needs to be done for five minutes
 and come help you lay the table
 or do something before you need it,
 your love tank is like,
 "Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum,
 "you're on top of the world."
  </li><li>And also, I mean, even, I think,
 and I don't know if it's an acts of service thing
 or a woman thing, but I've realized when I ask for help,
 if you get up and help me right when I ask,
 my love tank is filled.
 if you wait, like even if it's three or four minutes,
 it's, it's, it doesn't help me.
  </li><li>I think that's a man thing because historically
 when you've asked me for help,
 I think it's a theoretical question.
 So you're like, can you take out the trash in my head?
 I'm like, of course I can.
 I am physically able, I can take out the trash, yes.
 And I'm not being a jerk about it, but in my head,
 I'm not hearing this is an immediate request
 for would you take out the trash right now
 and my hands are covered in chicken juice?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I'm just thinking, yeah, I can.
 Or I'm thinking, sure, I'll just add it to my to-do list.
 And as soon as I'm done with the things I'm doing,
 I'll be happy to take the trash out.
 And it hasn't registered to me
 that you're literally standing there going, babe.
  </li><li>Yeah, like a--
  </li><li>I'm trashing your heart.
  </li><li>Yeah, and it's funny 'cause we didn't figure that out
 until a couple months ago, did we?
 Like I sort of figured out, oh, this is what's happening.
 You don't realize when I ask you, can you do this?
 I mean right now.
 And I mean right now because I didn't plan
 that the trash was gonna be filled or whatever,
 but now I'm stuck and I need help.
 And so I totally got it that you were like, yes, I'll add it to my list.
 But I'm like, that doesn't help me.
 I, you know, and so I don't know if that is because of the acts of service thing.
 Or, you know, if it's a man, woman thing.
 I think a lot of it is a man, woman thing that we just process information
 and different speeds or different senses of priority or urgency.
 Yeah.
 Speaking of priority, it's this is something we had to work hard on is none of the
 languages are better than the others.
 Yeah.
 Because I don't need quality time, I didn't understand your need for quality time.
 Right.
 And I just thought, well, obviously, let's have quality time by going and making out, like, I'm, I'm physical time and call as you touch.
 What's, what's your problem?
 Right.
 And we can dismiss the ones we don't understand.
 Yeah.
 And the other thing is just because you don't speak that language doesn't make that language weird.
 Yeah.
 But I'll tell you what is weird is learning to speak someone's language that isn't your primary language.
 Yeah.
 So you, you learning to speak words of affirmation.
 It's been a rough road.
 It hasn't.
 I've loved every part of it, but you've just expressed
 how weird you feel doing it.
 I would say I'm not great at expressing anyway,
 how I'm feeling at any given moment.
 Like I don't tend to out loud say, I'm in pain or,
 you know, I need this or my heart's doing that.
 Like I'm internally processing everything.
 So I would say even if I notice something
 that I look at something and I think,
 oh, it's so nice that he did that,
 but I don't necessarily say out loud,
 "Hey babe, I noticed that you did this,
 "thank you so much."
  </li><li>Right, which as a number one word of affirmation
 just kills my heart.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Are you freaking kidding me?
 I give up my Saturday night, that hasn't,
 you haven't even noticed.
  </li><li>Right, so, but I'll come in and think,
 "Well, you're trying to speak acts of service,
 "ammonestred to my heart, and my heart feels nice
 "that you did that, so that's fine."
 You know, and so everything's good,
 and I won't follow through to,
 but actually I could speak love back to you
 by affirming you and what you did.
  </li><li>Or just jumping me.
  </li><li>Or jumping you.
 I mean, obviously that's always an option.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Just getting naked and you'll be fine.
  </li><li>That's the truth, right there.
  </li><li>Oh, I know.
 I think too is not to feel like,
 I really struggled that one of my languages gifts
 because I thought, oh, that's the most shallow language
 to have, you know, oh, buy me a present,
 I don't know that you're left.
 you know, like how know that you love me feels like what, you know, I don't know.
 I've just never liked that that's something for me, but I, I think it will.
 I know it is.
 Right.
 And we can't get away from that because the point is where we, we all speak all
 of these languages.
 I mean, if you're not a gift giver, everyone likes it on their birthday when
 they're giving good gifts.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 So again, it's not that you don't value or don't like it.
 It's just not the fastest draining tank in your, out with a, you know, it's like
 printer cartridge. Why is it cyan always drains faster than all the others? Like what?
 Right.
 When I print anything in cyan and yet it's always empty.
 That's an excellent question. There's a conspiracy going on here.
 One of the things that we learned, this was Danny Silk. It's not Gary Chapman. Although,
 maybe Gary Chapman says I haven't read Gary's book in a while. Danny makes his point that,
 while I want your love, you can't be the source of my love. So, of course, in the context of this
 discussion we've been having, we've been talking about husbands and wives, but this works for friendships as well.
 Danny points out that actually you, AJ, you are my target for my love. God is my source.
 Yes.
 And so I have to have my tank filled from someone other than you. Otherwise, I'm going to be codependent real quick.
 Right. And then you can deplete me and I can deplete you and then we can just be mad at each other because we're both depleted.
 Right.
 Where actually it's our individual responsibilities to be filled from the Lord and have something
 to give to the enemy.
 Yeah.
 You're my target God's my source.
 So I get filled up from the Lord and then fill you up and you in turn are getting filled
 up from the Lord.
 What about what about in situations where you are not feeling loved?
 And that's an interesting one because like I can intellectually say, I know that AJ loves
 me.
 Of course, I know that AJ loves me.
 when my love tank is depleted or your love tank is depleted, talk about healthy ways of
 communicating your need for love.
 I throw stuff.
 Yeah.
 I'm just kidding.
 That's like, wait, what?
 I'm, I think you just have to say you're, you're not, you're not feeling loved.
 I mean, I think you just have to be able to talk through, Hey, what just happened
 right there, because actually this is how I experienced you.
 this is how that conversation just hit my heart. Can we talk about that? Because this is what
 I felt from that.
 And it's also providing a roadmap back to feeling loved. It's hard because you have to be vulnerable
 because typically most marriages, again, I'm talking about marriage in this context,
 but I'm sure it's the same for friendships, most marriages, each person in the marriage
 doesn't have the same love tank.
 So it feels vulnerable to say, actually, I feel really loved when you buy me gifts or I actually feel unloved it like a weekends or connection.
 When you come back from the store, say with a Mexican Coke for yourself, but not one for me when you know that I love Mexican Coke.
 Right.
 Or it really hurts.
 I mean, but who would do that?
 I don't know.
 Some heartless Canadian, I'm sure.
 In my defense, it was Izzy's not Coke.
 But anyway, moving on.
 I was trying to change the story to protect the innocent, but you just I would yourself on air.
 All right.
 Well, there you have it, folks.
 I'm a fast forgiver, but it's it's it's weird when you it's not weird.
 It's just hard to be vulnerable because it does sound shallow to say actually, I know
 that you love me.
 I'm not feeling loved right now.
 Could we go cuddle for a bit?
 I know that you love me.
 I'm not feeling loved.
 Can we go have a date?
 I know that you love me, but I feel loved when you take out the trash.
 But the only way you can help another person into your heart is by actually
 showing them the roadmap and helping them get there.
 Yeah.
 And being able to take stock of your own heart and realize when you're
 disconnecting, you know what I mean?
 Like when you're like, Oh, I actually feel very distant.
 Huh.
 And instead of going, huh, going, huh, we need to have a conversation and we need
 to fix it and not let it keep going.
 What happens when you feel like it hasn't made any difference?
 Try again.
 And what happens if that doesn't work?
 You try again because we're in this for life.
 Exactly.
 That there's a danger.
 It's real passive thinking that sounds like, well, I've already tried communicating
 that hasn't made any difference.
 Then my suggestion is communicate differently.
 Keep trying to communication until you can help your friend, spouse,
 be able to understand because connection is the most important thing in any relationship.
 And having said that, babe, though, yes, with your spouse, you keep trying again because you're in
 it for life. But I would say sometimes with friends, if you're hitting the, we just do not
 communicate well, and we are just missing it every single time. I think it's codependent to say
 we're in this for life and I've got to fix it. I think sometimes you just have to go, you know,
 We're just probably not going to be as good of friends as we were before.
 Right.
 And that's fine too.
 And that's fine.
 But I think in marriage, in my mind, there's no option.
 There's no plan B.
 Right.
 And so we're going to, we're going to hash this through.
 We're going to figure it out.
 We're going to practice this.
 We're going to get better communication because it's not an option to live
 disconnected.
 Right.
 And it's not an option to live, you know, uh, it less than how we're designed.
 And if you, the two of you on your own can get that done, bring in a skilled counselor.
 Oh, for sure.
 Bring in a third person.
 Say, hey, we're missing each other.
 Can you help us decode our messages?
 Yeah.
 Cause otherwise, I honestly, a marriage would be miserable if disconnection is your foundation.
 Horrible.
 And I don't want to live like that either.
 So.
 Right.
 So if you want to know what your love languages are, Gary Chantman's website, five
 love languages.com has a free love language assessment. You feel it gives you back a score,
 helps you understand it. If you haven't read the book, the five love languages, we highly
 recommend it. I'll put a link to it in the show notes.
 Dave, I heard we have a listeners question.
 We do. This week's comes from Beatrice who asks, "I had a dream in which I got a new
 Bible. So I thought I'd do that, especially since the Bible I have used daily is a new
 New King James have had for 27 years.
 So which version would you recommend?
 I'd love to dig deep into the word.
 Thanks.
 Beatrice, I would recommend the NESB.
 And it's funny, Alan and I have a little bit of a joke about that because I think you
 grew up reading the NIV, right?
 I grew up reading the NIV, but today I read the NLT, the new living translation.
 Yeah, which I like the NLT.
 I think what I like about the NASB, or at least when I started reading it, what I was told
 was it was one of the better translations in terms of...
 Everybody says that.
 How about the book?
 In terms of accuracy.
 So what I have is I have a parallel Bible.
 And you can get them leather-bound and whatever.
 But I have a parallel Bible with the NASB and the message.
 The message is like a newer modern day kind of wording of things.
 It's a functional translation.
 Yeah.
 Whereas the NSB would be a literal translation.
 Yeah.
 So you've got a Bible on either end of the spectrum together.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 You know, opposite ends of the spectrum.
 And then I go through and I read it on both sides and then I have a chat with the Holy
 Spirit.
 And then I love to go and just look stuff up in the NLT or NIV and see how different
 translations treat it if I'm confused between the two.
 But I love having the two on the different spectrum and being able to go back
 and forth and kind of dig through it that way.
 I would say Beatrice, if you've been reading the New King James for 27 years,
 another new King James would be great or an NASB, which will, you know, be very similar.
 You do tend to get whiplash when you're when you've read a certain version of the
 Bible for a long time because you've either memorized certain passages or just
 by osmosis from your continual reading you've memorized.
 And then when you begin to read another translation,
 it's jarring.
 Like for me, I love the message.
 I really do.
 But when I read the message, I get annoyed
 because it's changed my favorite passages.
 Now I know that's dumb, and it doesn't detract
 from the helpfulness of the message.
 But again, the new living translation is just, for me,
 is like a much friendlier version of the NIV.
 The truth is, whatever version, whatever modern version
 of the Bible, you buy is going to be really, really good.
 I encourage people to read whatever version of the Bible they find most
 accessible.
 And then I encourage people to study multiple versions of the Bible.
 So yeah, I have software I use.
 It's called a coordinates for the Mac.
 I regularly read or consult six or seven different versions of the Bible.
 But I read personally the new living translation, but, you know, go, go with
 whatever you would love.
 I would recommend going to one of your Christian bookstores and spending an hour
 just kind of browsing through some of your favorite passages. The ESV might be a great
 translation for you coming from the New King James. There's very trivial differences between
 the two. And the good thing about the ESV is they have a ton of different formats. I don't
 know where you're located, but if you're in the US life way, has a huge connection with
 the ESV. And so when I went in, they had like 20 different versions of the ESV in really,
 really nice layout style, hardback, softback, leather bound, journaling versions.
 Yeah.
 So my journaling Bible is ESV.
 I quite like it.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
