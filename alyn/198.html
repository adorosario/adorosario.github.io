<p> I live in a days but got for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to episode one ninety eight of keeping up with the Jones is where this week a j is back.
 I'm back baby I was Australia it was awesome you went for seven days.
 Well I think it's like eight days and like three and a bit of those days is traveling when you left on a Monday and you came back on a Monday.
 Yes, that's eight days.<br/>
 Oh, yes. See how that works.<br/>
 It was horrible watching.<br/>
 Like, obviously, I kept my times on the same,
 but I dropped you off at National International Airport
 and you got on a plane at 4pm to fly to Los Angeles.
 Yes.<br/>
 And then the next day, 24 hours later,
 at 4pm National time, you landed in Melbourne.
 Yes.<br/>
 Two days later.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I think we were like 28 or 29 hours door to door.
 Oh, and I got two hours of sleep and I gave you like proper heavy duty sleeping pills and I took them and it did nothing nothing.
 You were in a back row right next to the toilets with non reclining chairs.
 Yeah, and of course you know people that can't sleep feel it they should come back and stand in that space and have a conversation.
 You know, no the rest of us don't want to sleep please go ahead and have your conversation.
 But you forgave them and go over it sounds like yes, yeah, definitely.
 And so then you landed Wednesday and you went straight into teaching.
 Well, I mean, I got to hang with Gary and Sarah a bit and had some very good coffee and food and then went straight into teaching.
 And how was that?<br/>
 It was good. School of Profits was very fun. They're a great group of people.
 So that's a good profit.<br/>
 So yeah, that was really fun to just meet some of the people that Gary and Sarah are pouring into.
 And then you went straight into conference. Speak conference.
 Do you have fun? Well, of course you're going to fun as Gary and Sarah.
 Yeah, it was so fun. It was great.<br/>
 Everything was great.<br/>
 Borshope was great.<br/>
 I was going to teach you it was great, but I mean, that sort of sounds like
 what it was conceded.<br/>
 I was like Canadian speaker.<br/>
 The flu from America. Was she good?<br/>
 Oh, yeah, she was really good.<br/>
 She wasn't distracted by the fat, her husband wasn't there.
 She was. She was very distracted.<br/>
 That's what he was missing.<br/>
 Yeah, she just pushed through anyway.<br/>
 You're just a soldier.<br/>
 Right. And then you jumped back on the plane.
 Well, yeah, then I had Sunday off, got to go to stairway church.
 And, uh, and then, uh, we went downtown Melbourne, showed Elena downtown Melbourne,
 which was lovely and had fantastic food.
 Again, Gary and Sarah, they know how to eat.
 They did, I mean, they did coin the food is my love language hashtag.
 And yeah, by name and by nature, they are exceptional at eating well.
 I did not want for food or coffee.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 No, they're coffee machine.<br/>
 They just got a new coffee machine.<br/>
 The Jura.<br/>
 The Jura.<br/>
 Yeah, just like Baldur's fun.<br/>
 Oh, it's amazing.<br/>
 Oh, so good.<br/>
 Come on.<br/>
 I was like making up excuses for coffee, not that I had to, but yes.
 And then you hopped on a plane and then you flew home.
 It was interesting the time difference thing, because I would call you face time.
 You when I woke up, which was just as you were going to bed, usually, but 10 or 11 p.m.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And then I would call you just before I was going to bed.
 which was kind of mid afternoon for you.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And that seemed to work quite well,
 but was really surreal,
 'cause when I speak to you in the afternoon,
 which was the morning,
 it's the whole thing of you living a day ahead of me.
 I know it shouldn't be fascinating to me,
 but it just entertains my mind all the time.
 I'm like, you're finishing the day that I'm about to start.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
 I started getting my head around it,
 probably the day I was ready to fly home.
 And then now I'm all confused.
 like I'm upside down.
  </li><li>And how's jet lag mean?
  </li><li>Do you know what, I think,
 now this is gonna sound kind of strange,
 but I think because I didn't sleep very much
 on the way out, I slept like two hours,
 or no, maybe it was four hours.
 It was a short period of time.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So by the time, you know, we get in Wednesday morning,
 I stayed awake all day, I had a little nap,
 was about 20 minutes long,
 and it actually made me feel a little bit ill.
 You know, we just--
  </li><li>Oh, that's the worst thing to do.
  </li><li>It was bad idea.
 And then went and spoke and everything got home
 at like 10 or 10.30.
 I slept like the dead until about nine the next morning.
 I mean, just out.
  </li><li>On the way back, you were next to you, Sis.
 I think you only had what, 20 minutes sleep
 on the whole flight home.
  </li><li>No, I had two hours.
 No, that's not right.
 I had 45 minutes on the 15 hour journey.
 And then I slept about two hours on the plane
 from LAX to Nashville.
 Bounce back really good, except you got cold,
 'cause somebody sat next to you on the plane
 and had bronchitis and sounded like--
  </li><li>Both on the way there and on the way back.
 There was people in our row that were hacking up a lung.
 And I felt like just saying, I get it.
 Like you've bought your plane ticket
 and you can't just not go 'cause you have a cold,
 but you could wear a mask.
  </li><li>You don't wear a mask?
  </li><li>No. - Oh.
  </li><li>I'm like, you could do something
 so that everybody around you doesn't get infected.
  </li><li>That's when I think you have permission
 from everyone on the plane just to wrap a scarf.
 A scarf around them.
 Towel.
 Yeah.
 Airplane blanket.
 Something like that.
 You know.
 Vomit bag.
 Just say that wear this for the duration of the flight and we'll be cool.
 Well, I'm glad you're back, baby.
 Thanks.
 Um, everybody asked like, how did you cope without A.G.
 I was like, she was only gone seven days, which I can do to update that with eight days.
 And our kids are amazing.
 Yes.
 And there was only one or two meals that were a little bit sketchy.
 Wait, what?
 Well, you know, define sketchy.
 Well, let's not drag up the past.
 Oh, what are you saying?
 Here's the stuff that you missed.
 that you did breakfast for dinner.
 Only once, and they loved it, and it was amazing.
 Well, I can't judge you.
 I did it two days ago.
 We ate a lot of bacon.
 Here's the stuff you missed.
 Yes.
 Mr Blake's friend was on the podcast last weekend.
 Was amazing.
 So I heard you need to listen to it.
 So it's absolutely astonishing.
 I don't I don't pull the you need to often, but you need to.
 It was incredible.
 I had Blake while you had Elena.
 And so we kind of the Joneses and the strands divided in
 Concord, both chemistry.
 We shared them.
 I taught on Monday night at M&amp;A on five things I learned from being with the ornaments.
 Oh, that's so nice.
 I wasn't prepared for how emotional I'd get.
 I just for those of you who don't know, John and Carol Arnett are the founding
 pastors of a church called Catch the Fire Toronto home to the father's blessing
 on the Toronto blessing that happened in 1994.
 And really it's Father's Day as we record this.
 A mom and a dad to AJ absolutely.
 and then I married into the family and we lived with them and then we traveled the world with them and I was just sharing an
 an just talk stories but what it was like to live and travel with revivalists and I managed to narrow down a five things but I
 loved teaching on that made me I'm going to keep it because it made me really really really happy that's lovely then this Friday
 Tia turned to seven no or nine as the case may be turned nine. Yeah she turned nine. Yeah she turned nine. We had a pool party for
 which is the way to go. Yeah. Just here's a pool. Just sign this waiver and jump into it.
 Yeah. And there was like, I mean, very limited cleanup. We didn't have to screw around our
 house like mad people trying to make sure there was no things that were small, like
 a fit in people's mouths. And I don't know. We didn't have to do any of that. I know it
 sounds like nine year olds. You have to worry about them choking on small toys, but I more
 like the small siblings that might accompany them.
  </li><li>All right, I see.
 And then Sunday, today, Father's Day,
 my kids were so crave, babe.
 Do you know what they got me for Father's Day?
  </li><li>What did they get you?
  </li><li>They got me hand-made cards,
 which I quickly looked past.
 And then-- - Wait a minute,
 they worked really hard on those cards.
  </li><li>I know, but you know.
 And then what they got me were AirPods.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>I know, and I love them.
  </li><li>Amazing.
 How did they know?
  </li><li>We'll never know that mystery,
 but they managed to pick exactly what I wanted and it was great.
 Wow.
 And the big thing was the box was empty.
 It's almost like I'd already opened them.
 And was using them for a couple days before Father's Day.
 Yep, I love them.
 Almost like that.
 You've had them for ages for like a year maybe.
 Yeah, year and a half.
 So if you don't know what I'm talking about, these are apples, wireless, I guess earphones.
 They just kind of, they sit in your ear and they're Bluetooth,
 but it's just classic apple at its best.
 It's seamless, it's perfect.
 It's clever. It's fully refined. Oh, I just love them.
 So I've been trying to find excuses to wear them all the time.
 Apparently people think it's rude when you wear them and they're trying to have a
 conversation with you. It is. I'm just breaking them in its father's day.
 I get to do that. No, it's absolutely rude.
 Actually, I was talking to Abby this morning and she was like,
 I mean, what do we get daddy for father's day? Cause you know,
 we always get you some sort of gadgety thing. And I said,
 mommy got him air pods and she goes, Oh, mommy, you're too late.
 He bought his own earpods at the mall.
 And I was like, oh, baby, those are the same earpods,
 darling.
 When we said he'd go get them.
 And so she was like, oh, so what's in the bag?
 I said, just an empty box.
 She's like, oh, OK, well, I guess I'll
 make him rainbow letters on his card then.
 She did.
 It was beautiful.
 There you go.
 All right, so our main topic for this week
 is getting stuff done.
 What?
 Yeah, we picked a stop because we got a listener's question.
 as Vincent who wrote in and he said hello Alan AJ I was wondering if you could shed
 light and possibly even do a podcast on time management and even practical tools you use
 to manage your time wisely. As my life becomes more full throughout the week with business,
 family and friends I would love to know how you manage your time wisely.
 Gosh I'd love to say that we manage our time wisely 100% of the time I don't think we're
 achieving that at all. But we do have some tools and strategies that we use to do the
 best that we can with the energy that we have at the time.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 And you know, everything we're telling you right now is not theoretical.
 It's born out of our experience of having an enormous to-do list by choice.
 Like we, and the thing I love about you, babe, is you, I hope this sounds okay.
 You match me speed for speed workload for workload.
 Like we both love working hard.
 Yes.
 We both love projects.
 We're both highly fluent in the shape or life language.
 So we love plans, we love projects, we love to lead.
 And if anything, probably one of our big weaknesses is taking on too much.
 But because of that, and over the years, because this isn't a new thing,
 I think I've been like this since I discovered stuff I like, we are always
 working hard and we found ways to meet all the deadlines we have and refine things.
 And I'm not trying to say that we're perfect.
 That stuff does get dropped.
 But what I'm trying to say is over the years, over 10, 20 years, we've found out what works for us.
 And we want to share seven things that we found works for us and we hope works for you too.
 Yeah.
 I love that you just said over 10 or 20 years because, um, how long do you think we've been married for?
 Well, I've been working on this list before I ever met you.
 Well, that's true.
 So all right.
 I got you.
 Do you want to mean like I managed to get through school and yeah, I remember right.
 my thesis and, you know, all, you know, all, but began back then.
 Yes.
 And I learned from my parents, both my parents were incredibly hardworking and
 very efficient.
 Well, I'm not so sure about efficient.
 Well, I guess my dad was my mom just seemed to revel in work, but
 learn the art of not getting stressed by upcoming deadlines and managing to do it.
 And so we love it.
 So this is what we want to share with you.
 All right.
 So number one, work in chunks of time.
 explain that one.
 Well, I learned this from Dr. Tony Bazzan, who is the inventor of Mind Maps.
 And basically, he was saying that your interest level or your attention span flags over a duration
 of time.
 So if you take a 60 minute block of time, you tend to be really motivated at the beginning
 of time and you tend to be really motivated towards the end of the time, because you know
 you're 16 minutes is almost up, you're going to get a break. And then the bit in the middle
 tends to kind of sag and drop depending on how interested in the topic that you are.
 Right. And so his hope point was instead of working for a chunk of 60 minutes,
 the largest part of which you're going to be in that sag, split that 60 minutes up into
 three 20 minute blocks of time. Because then you'll have three lots of what he calls the
 the primacy effect, recency effect,
 like being motivated at the beginning,
 being motivated at the end for your first 20 minutes,
 and then your next 20 minutes, and then your third 20 minutes.
 I've drawn a graph which we'll put a link to
 in our show notes to show you what I'm talking about,
 but once I learned that little brain hack,
 it boosted my productivity.
 The actual, this is kind of bizarre,
 but the ideal time to stop working
 is when you just hit your stride.
 I know that makes no sense at all,
 but this is based on the work of Dr. Tony Bazan,
 who incidentally also learned my mapping,
 which I don't think we've ever talked about,
 a very creative way of taking notes,
 which I started doing my first year university,
 which helped me greatly.
 But yeah, work in chunks of time.
 I would do 20 minutes, quick break,
 20 minutes, quick break, 20 minute, long break,
 and then start the cycle again.
  </li><li>Right, now when don't you do that?
  </li><li>You do not do that when you have any creative tasks to do.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So creative tasks for me would be writing a sermon,
 video editing, I guess, for musicians that would be writing songs. Because for creative space,
 and I've got a great video that I'll link to in the show notes, John Kleese, the brilliant British
 comic who wrote all the, well, helped write all the Monty Python stuff and faulty towers,
 heard him do an amazing talk before it was a TED talk about his process for being creative.
 And I was like, ah, that's exactly how I think that's exactly the same. Like, for example,
 If I have to prepare a sermon, I won't even start unless I have a minimum of an hour,
 you know, an hour and a half of uninterrupted time. Just won't be worth it. I'd rather do busy work,
 emails, receipts, you know, whatever in that time. So, but work in chunks of time and also
 think about your time, like my most productive time is in the morning. So there's no point in me
 trying to schedule being productive at night. By night, I need to do routine stuff. I don't need to
 to do thinking stuff.
  </li><li>Right, 'cause you just too tired to get your brain online.
  </li><li>What about you though?
 You're kind of a night owl aren't you?
  </li><li>I'm, it depends on how much caffeine I've had
 in the morning, but yes, I would say I'm better
 in the afternoon and night than I am in the morning
 necessarily, so the morning, I'll tend to do more
 busy work there and get those things off my list.
 I also like to have some things checked off my list,
 so I feel like I have stuff done.
  </li><li>Right.
 which encourages me in forward motion.
 So.
 I try to eradicate all the things that will take my attention away and move that later.
 So again, throughout my week, Wednesday is my favorite day of the week,
 but it's not a day for getting things done because it's a day of meetings.
 Right.
 So it's my favorite day because I'm with some of my favorite people.
 You know, we've got passes meeting or we're meeting with Jeff or we've got our
 all staff, we've got our senior team in the afternoon.
 I know on Wednesday, I will get nothing done.
 And by that, I mean, I won't produce anything.
 I'll be in lots of meetings,
 meetings are where I find out what I'm going to be doing
 once I finish this meeting.
 You can't be productive in meetings.
 So I try and limit Wednesday to my meeting day
 so that I'm free the rest of the week to work.
  </li><li>Right.
 All right, number two is live in day tight compartments.
  </li><li>Yeah, talk about that.
  </li><li>I don't know if we do it exactly the same,
 but I think we're pretty similar.
 I was thinking about, as we were going into May, I was feeling like I was getting overwhelmed
 with all the stuff that had to get done.
 So, we had the conference coming up, we had a weekend away in Atlanta, we had Australia,
 so there was a bunch of things coming up and I was aware I needed a whole bunch of messages
 ready and stuff like that. And so the way I mitigate the stress of that is, all right,
 the next thing is the source conference. I'm just thinking about that. I'm not thinking
 about what happens the weekend after or whatever. I am just living in what can I get done today
 and what needs to be done in the next couple of days rather than getting stressed about
 what the next month looks like because that's never going to help me.
 And then once source conference was done, then I was like, "Okay, I'll have a day of
 rest and now I'm free to look at what the weekend looks like."
 Right.
 But I learned that from you.
 I never did that before.
 I learned it from Jesus.
 Oh.
 Yeah.
 Matthew 6 verse 34, Jesus says, "Do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about
 itself.
 Each day has enough trouble of its own."
 And Tony Wakefield actually taught me this phrase.
 He said, "Worry does not equals care."
 So I learned to stop worrying because I used to think, oh, I'm demonstrating my responsibility
 and my care for the things that are so my plate by worrying about them.
 And then I realized, no, I don't need to do that.
 I don't need to waste today's energy on tomorrow's responsibilities.
 So I just focused on today and just asked Jesus for grace to get through today and knew that,
 you know, I would have, I would have graced for each particular day that, that I've
 gone on.
 What we do is each Monday, when we wake up, as we look at what is coming up on the week
 and we apportion energy that we need for each day.
 Yes.
 And sometimes the days are crazy.
 Sometimes we haven't planned things brilliantly because of either necessity or
 forgetfulness.
 Right.
 Necessity would be maybe we have a really busy day, a Tuesday that's perfectly
 manageable, but then crisis happens and we need to be called into a situation or
 something happens or, you know, one of the kids falls or whatever.
 And you're like, okay, all I have to do is get through today and it will be
 who are assuaying for me tomorrow to actually manage that.
  </li><li>Yeah, we're also introverts.
 So we also manage our energy levels
 in terms of what we have left to spend.
  </li><li>Right, I'm trying to give an example
 that we had the other day.
  </li><li>Yeah, like for example, a couple of weeks ago,
 when I was in the midst of my day-type compartment
 finishing off of May scenario,
 we had, just before I flew to Australia,
 was an alumni event at Aarrington Vineyard. And so, you know, you didn't have the energy
 to go. I did have the energy to go because I had reserved energy to be able to go and
 do that. So I went and you stayed home.
 Yeah. And I knew if I had gone, it wouldn't be pleasant for the people there and it wouldn't
 be pleasant for me.
 No. And you would want to leave half an hour in or an hour in and then I would miss out
 on...
 even that, I mean, I just knew it has no bearing on the people or the activity. It's just
 I've used up the week's energy by the time we get to Friday. And I was like, Oh, if I'm
 going to be useful for preaching on Sunday, I need to actually recharge. I've got time
 to give stuff away. And so yeah, it's we'll cover energy management later, but that's
 a day type compartment. Number three is if you take nothing else away from this podcast,
 Number three way is learn to write stuff down.
 Almost every single productivity expert you will ever read talks about the importance
 of having some manageable way of getting ideas out of your head onto paper.
 I think it was David Allen who said your mind is for having ideas not holding them.
 The amount of stress that you burden yourself by talking yourself through the day to not
 forget things can be solved by having a really good system.
  </li><li>AJ, you have some sort of planner, what's it called?
  </li><li>Oh, it's an incand-volt planner.
 I love it. - Right, which you love.
 I have stuff on my iPhone,
 I know that comes as a big surprise.
  </li><li>Yes, I'm shocked.
  </li><li>We'll talk about that stuff in a second,
 but for now I'm just talking about the high level thing
 of having somewhere to write stuff down.
 So for example, I'm in worship this morning,
 I'm singing my guts out, and as I'm singing in worship,
 I'm not thinking about anything other than the majesty of Jesus,
 this thought passes through my head
 about what I need to talk to Jeff about on Wednesday
 or upcoming meeting.
 And rather than having to kind of like worship
 and keep that thought in my head,
 so don't forget until Wednesday,
 I don't wanna do that.
 I wanna be present between now and Wednesday.
 I just pull out my favorite to do apps,
 which is called Things for iPhone.
 And I just make a note of it in my project
 called Meetings with Jeff.
 And I write down and boom, I can forget it
 and I can go straight back to worship.
 Another thing, I'm listening to Jeff,
 his opening line as he's preaching this morning.
 And as soon as he says something,
 it's like a waterfall of revelation
 just goes tumbling through my head.
 And I'm like, this is profound.
 This is the answer to the question.
 I was asking the Lord.
 And so I pull out again my phone and I go to the notes app
 and I just write down all of the revelations in my head
 so that I don't have to remember to do it later.
 Or when it comes to sermon prep on Thursday,
 I'm like, what was that revelation
 the Lord gave me on Sunday?
  </li><li>Right.
 God, I'm reading that. - God, I'm reading that.
  </li><li>Never forget it, but look at that I have.
 Yeah, get it out of your head and onto paper.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Number four, review your calendar and to-do lists.
  </li><li>Okay, let's talk about the importance of calendars.
  </li><li>I love calendars.
  </li><li>We have, how many calendars do we have?
  </li><li>Well, we have it all separated by category.
  </li><li>Right, well, I call them calendars.
 So I have my own personal calendar,
 you have your own personal calendar,
 we have our shared calendar,
 we have our kids school calendar,
 We have our family calendars that we need to know about.
  </li><li>We have our, yeah, like our booked babysitter calendar.
  </li><li>We have guests are coming to stay our house calendar.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>And they're all shared with various people
 that need to know all that information.
  </li><li>And then we have all of our work calendars.
  </li><li>And then, yeah, but I turn all them off.
 You know, I just, they're there if I need to ask.
  </li><li>Do you?
  </li><li>Yeah, I don't want to see what.
  </li><li>I have them on.
  </li><li>Yeah, but then that's just visual clutter.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>It's just horrible.
 Like I don't need to know what women's gonna face on.
  </li><li>But I don't have all the information.
 Oh, I don't have women's ministry on.
 That's a good point.
 I have the calendars that affect me,
 like the school calendar in M&amp;A.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, I don't know that.
 Yeah, I have those, but like there's about 30 different
 grace in our calendar.
  </li><li>That's true. - I turn them off.
 So writing stuff down isn't enough.
 You actually have to review it.
 So writing stuff down is great,
 but how many of you have ever had the problem
 where you've been writing things down,
 but then you can't remember where you wrote it down.
 That's still not a good system.
 You need a single stop of where you put stuff down.
  </li><li>This is the place where I put it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, and every morning when we get up,
 or usually when we're driving the car,
 we review each morning to get an overview
 of what's happening in the day.
 The start of each week, we review the whole week.
 Like, what have we got going on so we know where we are?
 And again, because of the way I do things,
 I know that all my notes are gonna be in notes,
 all my to-dos are gonna be in things,
 and so on and so forth.
  </li><li>Yeah, and that way stuff doesn't catch you by surprise.
 I mean, occasionally you're still gonna have those moments,
 but you have a lot less of them
 if you're using a calendar.
 Right, which leads us to point number five, which is you need an inbox for everything.
 Is that mean?
 Well, that means you and I and everybody who's listened to this are constantly inundated
 with incoming information to phone calls, text messages, requests, mail, junk mail,
 e-vites invitations, but let it from your back, whatever, you need an inbox for
 everything. So again, email, well, we'll talk about what I do with email. And I said, well,
 let me tell you what I do with email right now. I used to have inbox zero. I haven't
 prided that in forever. I need to get back to it. But this is how I used to do email.
 Sad to say right now, I, I don't know what I'm doing with my email, but this is what I
 used to do. And I felt way more productive when I was in charge. But I used to use my inbox
 only for incoming information. Like I wouldn't actually do anything with the... I wouldn't
 actually use my inbox as a mailbox. Let me try and explain. When any...
 Because you're going to need to, that doesn't make any sense.
 All right. When I'd sit down to do my email, I'd have three folders.
 I'd have a folder called reply, a folder called store, and a folder called action.
 Everything in that inbox was treated as hostile until it was moved to one of those folders.
 So I open up my inbox and I would just start going through it.
 If it's something I need to reply to, I put it in the reply folder.
 If it's something I don't need to reply to, but it's information I'm going to need later on in life.
 I put it in the store folder.
 If it's something that's going to take more than just two minutes to reply, I put it in the action folder.
 Like if it's Jeff saying, Hey, Alan, could you forward me this presentation
 after you've updated it?
 I want to remember that I've done that.
 So I'm going to put in the action folder.
 And really that's how I do email.
 It's a triage approach.
 I just open up and I try and get my inbox to zero and I put all the email in
 reply store in action.
 If it doesn't fit in one of those three things, it gets deleted.
 The reason I do that is then I can approach my email with different levels
 of energy in mind.
 If I'm feeling highly productive, I can open up my email.
 I can go to the reply folder and I'm just in a reply mode.
 I'm just banging out all the information that needs to be done.
 Reply, reply, reply, reply, reply.
 If I've got more time and I'm thinking, oh, I need to get on with some stuff or, you know, stuff that's going to take a little bit longer, I go to my action folder and start working on that stuff.
 And from time to time, I'll just go through my store folder and see if it needs to be filed away or if it's okay where it is.
 The goal is to always have zero emails in my inbox and I always know what needs to be replied to, what's just in storage and what needs to be actioned.
 Does that make sense?
 Yeah, so good.
 Yeah, I haven't done it in a while, which is why my inbox right now just looks like disaster.
 Hmm, I do.
 But I just use the delete key a lot more because I...
 Yeah.
 Is it okay to talk about something that might publicly shame you?
 I suppose.
 Wait, why are we publicly shaming me?
 Well, it's not the goal.
 I just wonder, like, when I look in urine box, I can't see you the forest for the trees because there's so many...
 What I would call junk emails, but they're all emails you subscribe to, like old Navy, the gap,
 or the Sonoma.
 Well, some of them I have tried to unsubscribe from many times, and I'm still getting the stinking
 emails. So I just go through every two or three days and just delete everything.
 But I might have to get more aggressive in my unsubscribing approach.
 A tool that I have used, which I have really, really, really appreciated, which I haven't renewed
 this year, just because it wasn't in our budget. But last year, for Christmas, I bought myself
 a year's subscription to something called Sanebox. And what a Sanebox did is largely
 automate what I've just talked about. But the beautiful thing about it is it would take care
 of the persistent junk mail that you've tried to unsubscribe from, but didn't work. I highly
 recommend it. It's quite expensive, but I highly recommend it. It really did help me. I think
 that's part of the reason I've gotten out with a habit is because it was doing it for me automatically.
 What's interesting to automatically sort out your mailbox into what it's and it's a very very clever what it thinks you need to see.
 And some of the email clients like gmail does that and you know outlook does that but this does it plus plus on steroids and they have a brilliant mailbox called same black hole that any email you drop in you will never hear from that person ever again.
 because they just have all that so how do i get that
 you speak to your friendly neighborhood nerd like me okay sure we can come to some arrangements we talk later yes we can talk.
 It's not just about your mail inbox so you need like i had a boss who told me only a piece of paper touch your hand once.
 So staff memos mailbox your incoming email home i've got a place where i just dump them currently it's my desk then i just go through the mail once a week.
 I've also taken that approach of unsubscribing from everything i can paper wise yeah they've ramsi taught us.
 A thing that you can forget we did our old house and since we've moved addresses we need to redo it but basically it's like a death nail for credit card or loan offers you just notify one central body i forget what it is i'll have to look at my notes.
 but you send them your mailing address and you never ever receive another credit card loan anything like that in the mail is that would be nice because they're so annoying they are but you know my kids get to earn money by shredding it so there's that well there's that alright you need an inbox for everything not just email.
 Number six is something we've touched on already where we talk about it's not time management you need to worry about.
 it's energy management talk about energy management for me.
 Well, there's some things that we both do. We have some specific restaurants that are typically the
 ones that we will go to if we're going out on a date or we're taking people out for dinner.
 Part of the reason for that is I know what I order there so I don't have to spend time on that
 energy. I don't have to spend energy on that decision.
 Right, there's a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School who wrote this brilliant article in the Harvard Business Review.
 He said this, "Making too many decisions about mundane details is a waste of a limited resource your mental energy."
 Basically, this research shows that your decision-making processes don't really distinguish between big serious decisions that need to be made in trivial ones.
 Right.
 So if you can limit the amount of decisions you need to make about stuff that really doesn't matter, like where to eat, what to wear.
 If you can pre-decide all of that, life becomes a way simpler.
 And you've got more energy to make bigger, more important decisions.
 Right.
 So that's one of the ways that we've sort of streamlined things a little bit to
 preserve energy.
 We also do things like Amazon subscribe and save.
 So through Amazon subscribe and save, I have ordered a lot of our
 regular household things.
 So I don't have to think about them.
 So it's paper towel, toilet paper, laundry detergent, and then some basic foods that we
 use every month. I know we're going to go through a fair amount of it. And so it all just arrives,
 and that is staple food and staple things that have arrived that I don't have to go get. It's on
 my door. And more importantly, it's stuff you don't have to remember to go get or stuff you have
 to remember. Have we run out of this? It just removes that whole equation. Right. And then add in that
 but it's usually way cheaper on Amazon.
 So I feel like I'm being thrifty.
  </li><li>And then similar to that,
 we try and minimize friction as much as possible.
 So there's, you know, I know my schedule,
 I have the same schedule every day.
 In fact, our whole life runs on the schedule.
 So we have our own schedule,
 we've automated as much as possible in our life.
 For example, in our house, we automate tons of stuff.
 We automate our doors opening and closing them, locking.
 I never have to, I never worry have I locked a door because the doors lock themselves.
 I never have to worry about lights being left on because it turned themselves on and off,
 even down to the irrigation system in our lawn.
 We don't have to water plants because they do automatically and they don't do it if
 it's been raining recently.
 You know, all that sort of stuff.
 I'm trying to eradicate the need to think about things so that I can spend my thoughts
 on better things.
 Yeah.
 Well, I mean, also our kids lives run on schedules.
 Right.
 in our household is pretty much on schedule.
 And that works for us.
 People come to stay.
 Yes, it does.
 Because we have to be like, deep breath.
 People are more important than schedule.
 People are more important than schedule.
 We can do this.
 The kids can stay up half an hour later just to see so-and-so when they get here.
 Yes, but...
 It is part of the reason not just for our survival, but our ability to enjoy our life
 is things are automated.
 Like when school's in session, it gets way more automated.
 in the summer were positively laid back.
 I know the kids didn't go to bed till eight to nine.
 I'm just slacking.
 Just slacking, right?
 So that's us trying to manage our energy as well as possible.
 And then finally, talking about that, our final point is this whole thing that we learned a number of years ago that self-care is not selfish.
 One of the most important things about getting things done is knowing when to stop.
 Yeah.
 Your rest, it's that Jason Bourne line, "rest" is a weapon.
 If you think that you can only rest when things are done, you will never rest because there are all the things that need your attention always, especially as pastors.
 If we don't say no to the demands on our time, there will always be demands on our time.
 Yeah.
 So my weekends, I try and prioritize for our family.
 So when people try and connect, you know, hey, can we do dinner on a, you know, a weekend? I'll be like, oh, I'm so sorry.
 That's, that's just not possible. I try and prioritize my kids or, you know, we, we have learned.
 Learn that self care is not selfish and I'm a better person tomorrow if I rest today.
 And we also try and set each other up to get what each other needs as well.
 Like I know you need a long time.
 I need a long time.
 So we try and make sure that we're helping each other get the self time that we need
 so that we are the best version of ourselves.
 Sometimes that self time just looks like you need a morning in your pajamas playing
 Zelda, doesn't it, AJ?
 It does.
 That looked like yesterday morning.
 I was like sitting there and I played Zelda probably for two hours.
 Maybe a little more than two.
 You think so?
 I think so, yeah.
 But I did realize, wow, I haven't really played this game in ages, like in months.
 And it was just really fun and relaxing and I really enjoyed it.
 And, you know, MJ and Tia just sat there and, you know, not played with me
 because only one person plays, but they helped me find things.
 It was sweet.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 And it was really good.
 And it was a good one.
 You were a better version of yourself because you work like nobody's business.
 Yeah.
 And then I got up, made lunch and cleaned the house for the next seven hours.
 It was messy.
 So there you go.
 There's our top seven things that we've learned over the years for getting stuff done.
 Number one, working chunks of time.
 Number two, learn to live in day type compartments.
 Number three, write stuff down.
 Number four, review the stuff you've written down.
 Number five, get an inbox for everything.
 Number six, remember it's not just about time management,
 it's also energy management,
 and finally number seven, self care is not selfish.
 If you are listening to this in the car,
 or if you're listening to this doing well dishes,
 and you're thinking, oh, I wanted to take notes on that,
 we have got an article that we actually wrote
 on how to get stuff done.
 We'll put a link to it in the show notes.
 It covers all of the seven points.
 It's also illustrated with pictures, graphs, and videos.
 And plus there's a reading list there as well.
 So if you want to know the books that we've read
 that have really helped us on that journey,
 We've got links there and we'll post it there.
 AJ and other news, interesting stuff's been happening to you on Instagram.
 Tell us all about it.
 Yes, somebody is an imposter is imposting.
 Do imposters impost?
 I don't know, they do nefarious things.
 Yes.
 So there's somebody who's pretending to be me, who has taken my picture off of a web page
 and has started an Instagram account that's called AJ's Prayer Something.
 It's AJ Jones prayer page, all one word.
 So what this person is doing,
 they've created AJ Jones prayer page
 as an Instagram account, got a photo of AJ,
 I got a link to gracener.us/school,
 so it looks super official.
 They don't have any followers, thankfully,
 but they are a private page,
 but what they've been doing is they've been following
 a lot of people who already follow us,
 so it kind of looks legit.
 And if this thing goes the way it usually does,
 they'll probably start asking for money,
 which we won't do.
 So we've reported it, but would ask you to block them
 or report them for spam or report them,
 however you choose.
 And sorry, again, if anybody goes after you,
 there's only three accounts on Instagram.
 There's @Allyn, there's @_aj-jones,
 and there's @Allyn on AJ.
 Those are the only three accounts that we have
 and we manage, and they're the legit ones.
  </li><li>All right, well, thank you for sticking with us

 We pray you have a wonderful week,
 and we will talk to you next week.
