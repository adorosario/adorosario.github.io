<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Eiji Jones. - Yes, sir.
  </li><li>Episode 235, how the heck are you?
  </li><li>I'm good.
  </li><li>How are you? - Tell the good people
 about this week.
  </li><li>Like all the things that happened this week?
  </li><li>All of them.
  </li><li>Yeah, there wasn't that many things.
  </li><li>Well, Trent, I had some fun.
  </li><li>Go and tell me your fun.
  </li><li>I got to do some events.
 So last year, because of COVID,
 we had to cancel our Small Group Leaders event or postpone.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so.
  </li><li>Small group leaders are people who help us
 run the school of supernatural life.
 They are former students, they volunteer.
 Just in case we've got new people to the broadcast
 and they don't know what a small group is.
  </li><li>Yeah, and they spend a year helping us pastor
 all the students.
  </li><li>And usually we like to take them away on retreat
 and say thank you to them.
 And we couldn't do that last year because of,
  </li><li>Yes. - Continue.
  </li><li>And so we planned a fun day here,
 like in Nashville, to get together a year later
 and just sort of say, what was your year like
 and then have fun together.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So we had breakfast in a park and hired this company
 that set up like this gorgeous table
 and all these cushions and never, I mean, it was just like--
  </li><li>I thought we needed breakfast in a park,
 it was like, can't your own squirrel
 and roast it over a fire?
  </li><li>No, no, you really love it, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>You hire the catering company.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Well, like, set up and make it pretty company
 and then got food and all that kind of stuff.
 So we had a lovely time and then we went to Topgolf,
 Now explain to me what top golf is.
 Well, top golf is essentially a driving range,
 which I'm not even sure you know what that is.
 Excuse me.
 I know exactly.
 It's like a go-car range, but you, I'm kidding.
 You just whack golf balls off in the distance.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 Essentially.
 Is it real or is it virtual?
 No, it's real.
 How?
 Okay.
 So, wait, I'll explain it.
 So there's three stories worth of teas that you can hit from.
 Yep.
 And all of the golf balls must have some sort of tracker in them.
 So you, like when it's your turn, you press your name and now knows this, this ball is yours.
 It delivers a ball just for you and you hit it.
 And then when you switch to the next person, it delivers balls for that person.
 So I'm, some way it's tracking where these balls go.
 And there's these massive, like, there's these massive holes that you're trying to hit them into for extra points.
 points and it's really fun.
 And it's real golf clubs, real golf balls.
 Yes.
 How far along is the building to drive the?
 Well, it's it's outside.
 Oh, it's outside.
 I thought it was inside.
 No, it's outside.
 Three stories.
 Yeah, it's three stories outside.
 Like it's like, how can you have three stories outside?
 Three stories of balconies outside.
 And you're all like on balconies facing out into this netted area.
 Oh, OK.
 So it's yeah, it's really fun.
 For some other reason, I thought it was an indoor arena.
 No, no, no. It's outdoors.
 What's the?
 I'm confusing.
 Isn't there a top golf beside Best Buy?
 No. OK, that's where my confusion started.
 So you did that.
 That sounds like a lot of fun.
 It was so much fun.
 And I placed exactly the same on both games.
 I was neither the loser nor the winner.
 I was dead in the center.
 If you aren't the winner, aren't you by default the loser?
 Well, that's a very interesting way of looking at it.
 But we were just having fun.
 Oh, I got a sneeze.
 And in addition, I golf left handed, or at least when I used to golf, which is
 20 years ago, I learned to golf left handed and I only had right handed clubs.
 You know, I've never played a round of golf.
 That's very sad.
 Staff at Grayson are trying to make me.
 We did a staff fund a golf course.
 I don't know.
 Like I did not have seen that because that was.
 And I tried it once.
 Yeah.
 I was just like, what is the point?
 And just never bothered.
 Oh, it's really fun.
 I like driving the golf course.
 It's kind of like pool, like playing pool,
 but you're outdoors with completely different influence.
 So one might say it's completely different than pool.
 Is it like an analysis like rollerblading?
 But one might say you have different instruments.
 But there's no rollerblades.
 Yeah, so we did top golf. That was super fun. And then, you know, went to the pharmacy and then had pharmacy as a restaurant.
 So you went to the pharmacy? Yeah. I visited East Nashville. I was very brave.
 Yep. And then they went go-karting. But I didn't go go-karting because I came home because it was Abigail's first school dance.
 Big weekend for our eldest daughter, first school dance. Yep.
 which I got to drive her there in the Tesla.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But nobody was waiting, so you know,
 when the big doors kind of came up,
 what are those gullwing doors?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>X-wing doors?
  </li><li>I don't know, gullwing, I think.
 X-wing is like a fighter.
  </li><li>Nobody cared.
  </li><li>But I was like, the car's driving you there,
 isn't that the coolest thing ever?
 She was like, "Oh."
 And then the next day, it was her 14th birthday.
 And so we had a little swari in the backyard,
 a socially distanced outdoor fire pit hang for her.
  </li><li>Which was great, but she was so cute,
 getting ready for the dance.
 Like I just love that she was like.
  </li><li>You can no longer tell public stories
 about your cute 14 year old.
  </li><li>Why?
  </li><li>Because of she ever--
  </li><li>She's 14.
  </li><li>Yeah, she does, doesn't want this.
  </li><li>I have to get approved of the post pictures on Instagram.
  </li><li>So I should have gotten her to agree--
  </li><li>You should have got a media release to tell a story.
  </li><li>Dang, all right, well, just don't tell it.
  </li><li>You actually got out, you had some life activity.
 I got to have dinner with a couple of friends this week.
  </li><li>Well, no, no, wait, but I'm--
  </li><li>Oh, I'm sorry.
 That's Tuesday. We're only on Sunday.
 So Sunday, we had like a lunch for all of the local school of
 supernatural life students. So like half of our students are in
 other places, the world, Australia, Germany, you know,
 whatever. But about half of them, whatever. Yeah, we love all
 the different places, not whatever. But you know what I
 think. So I got to meet a bunch of our students that I haven't
 actually seen face to face like other than on a little tiny
 screen. So that was really fun. And we played nine, nine squares in the air,
 squared nine square in the air, the nine square. I don't know.
 I know it's just like golf, right? But there's no golf clubs.
 Anyway, it's kind of like volleyball. Like nothing like volleyball.
 You are the analogy queen today. It was very fun. It would be stretching it to say
 I dominated because I certainly didn't, but I had, I had fun.
 So that was all that mattered.
 And trash talked.
 So that was good.
 Permission to tell my stories.
 OK, you may tell your stories.
 I'm now finished.
 You may begin.
 We had lunch with our friend, Mark and Kim.
 They were in town.
 Mark DuPont was speaking at Grace Center last weekend and still around.
 So we hang out with him, which was fun.
 And I had a friend from St. Louis, St. Louis.
 St. Louis.
 St. Louis.
 But you don't really pronounce the S.
 Listen, listen, listen, listen, yeah, he came in and we try to go to Bartaco
 What do you mean you don't finesse? Yes, it's when?
 Well, the kind of the locals don't if you listen to them, they don't. It's like Edinburgh, like
 Americans say Edinburgh. Well, that's because it doesn't make any sense. Well, I'm trying to honor
 like a stranger is to a local ear to hear an American say Edinburgh, right?
 Ed and Brodians don't say that.
 So St. Louis doesn't sound right.
 St. Louis doesn't sound right.
 It's St. Louis.
 All right, maybe I'm wrong.
 I don't know.
 Okay. The way he says it.
 Okay. All right.
 What Canadian said, St. Louis?
 Anyway, we try to eat a bar taco up in...
 What's that called?
 12 South. 12 South. Thank you.
 But they had an hour and a half wait.
 So we just walked down the road and had Edley's barbecue,
 which was delicious again, outdoor on the patio.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So, now I'm hungry.
  </li><li>I would be sad if I drove up expecting Bartaco
 and then had at least just because my shaper
 get would get distressed.
  </li><li>But you know when I'm laid back,
 I can pivot on a die.
  </li><li>You're not laid back.
  </li><li>Well, I was hungry.
 And so the hunger necessity,
 I changed my mind really quickly.
 And I had great barbecue.
 I'd brisket.
  </li><li>I just want to explore something for a moment.
 Do you actually think that you're laid back?
  </li><li>No.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>That's the joke.
 Can you imagine how out of touch I would be
 if I thought I was just,
 let go with a flow.
  </li><li>Ask me if you're the back.
  </li><li>Whoa, pick me, pick me.
  </li><li>All right, well that's our weekly update.
 We hope you had an amazing week, whatever you were doing,
 wherever you were, we hope you were safe.
 And I realize this podcast goes around the world.
 So you're in varying degrees of COVID normality,
 you know, in some countries return to life in some places or shut down on
 Tario's back for its third big lockdown. Yeah.
 Scotland's been into open up. Yeah. Wow. Oh, I had fun. I got to, I forgot about this.
 I got to speak in Scotland without ever leaving my house. Our friends at Queen
 Park Baptist Church, Queen Park Baptist Church. Thank you. The past there, Ian.
 He reached out and said, Hey, would you want to share with us? I was like, I would
 love to share. So we recorded or I recorded a message. It's probably the only time I've
 ever spoken in a church where my message had a warning. Like, "Hey, if there's young children,
 you might know what them to hear Allen's message." But not a warning you gave it with somebody
 else. No, I was like, "That's so genius. I need some sort of metal for that." But because
 there was some horrific parts of the story, but I was just reading the Bible basically.
 So that was a lot of fun. So and I actually I watched their service
 I scrubbed past me speaking because I already know what I'm speaking on but I so loved the worship
 I still love the hosts the emcees who were doing it and I think it was Rayna Rayna said a little prayer
 I so blessed me. I don't know Rayna if you'll ever hear this
 But when I heard you pray for me, I really blessed me and really touched my heart and so that was fun
 That was super fun again to speak in churches without ever leaving my house. I'm a huge fan. Yeah, so yeah, it's okay
 Okay, so our topic this week is walking in wisdom.
 That's from that list that you got from Instagram.
 We're still working through the list.
 And I did think about a topic for a book this week though.
 Oh.
 Yeah, I was in the shower.
 And I thought about, yeah, I've been pondering this whole thing about like, you know, write
 a book.
 Yeah.
 I've been thinking about writing a book on the goodness of God with the subtext of the book
 because you know, you could come at the goodness of God from any angle.
 Thinking about writing about the judgment of God.
 About judgment and where does judgment fit in with the goodness of God?
 And exploring that because I've been on a theological swim.
 A digging festival.
 That's what you think is digging.
 I guess I'm on wall.
 If that's how you swim, no wonder you move so slow.
 I don't know why this isn't working.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Oh my gosh, so much abuse.
 All right.
  </li><li>I feel bad for people that can't see what you just did
 because it was so funny.
  </li><li>We are our staff on day to day
 and we had like a table tennis,
 is that what the game's called?
  </li><li>It's like golf.
  </li><li>It's like golf, but.
 (laughing)
 Is it ping pong?
  </li><li>It's called ping pong.
  </li><li>A little table tennis.
  </li><li>Well, maybe some countries call it table tennis.
  </li><li>They're like soccer and football.
  </li><li>They're playing ping pong.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I just thought like before they start playing,
 they're in such an athletic stance.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean--
  </li><li>And when they start playing,
 they're like prancing, dancing backwards and forwards.
 Anyway.
  </li><li>It was pretty fun to watch.
  </li><li>What are we talking about?
  </li><li>Wisdom.
  </li><li>I don't know.
  </li><li>Yes, wisdom.
  </li><li>Here's the danger was talking about wisdom.
 The Book of Proverbs talks about like not,
 you know, there's more hope for a fool
 than somebody who thinks they're wise.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so here we are gonna be trying to talk about wisdom,
 like how you grow into wisdom.
 And the kind of subtext of even talking about wisdom is,
 hey, we have wisdom to share on a topic of wisdom,
 which automatically puts us in the category
 of being foolish.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So right in the front, let me say,
 we are not up here saying,
 we're a good benchmark of wise people.
 Do what we're saying, that's not what we're doing.
 We are saying we have been people
 who have devoted our lives to wanting more of wisdom.
 And probably the best record to say is
 On my best day by the grace of God, I can recognize our token of wisdom I might walk in.
 Well, right.
 And be fully aware of how much lacking in wisdom I am.
 Right.
 But I also feel like wisdom is a gift.
 It's something that you get by asking for it.
 That's true.
 And what you have of it.
 I mean, some of it you're going to gain life experience, that kind of stuff.
 But I feel like for the most part, even even when you think about life experience stuff, the reason just the Holy Spirit bringing it back to your mind as is a gift, as a wisdom.
 Yeah, is a gift.
 So I feel like anytime that you're trying to operate in wisdom, you need to be flowing with the Holy Spirit to actually fully do that.
 Let me tell you about how I started on this journey.
 OK.
 And I was thinking about this.
 And this is why I love being a computer nerd.
 because I have a hard drive filled with stuff that's important to me.
  </li><li>Yeah. - From years and years ago.
  </li><li>This is almost 20 years ago. - Wow.
 In 2003, when I moved to Toronto to do the school, I joined a gym.
 So, it was probably 2004, because I didn't know the students.
 So, 2004, the gym on Atwell Drive in Toronto.
  </li><li>Yeah. Well, it's not actually on Atwell,
 so I'm not a little size-street. But anyway, it's close enough.
  </li><li>Yeah, off of Atwell. - Yeah.
  </li><li>No, no, the front face is Atwell. - Well, okay, sure.
 Okay, so join a gym and I remember being on a elliptical machine and I remember thinking
 Oh, I'm gonna catch up on some messages. This is a message from Graham Cook. He spoke in Edinburgh at the Kings Church
 I would say a couple of years before that so anywhere between 2000 and 2003
 So almost 20 years ago, and I want to play this I want to play this clip
 This is and so Graham one of my heroes just an amazing profit an amazing teacher somebody had really looked up to
 I don't mean that the past tense, I still look up to Graham.
 But at this time, hadn't met Graham, didn't know Graham,
 just knew of him as a speaker,
 and had gone to this conference,
 I bought the conference set,
 and I'm listening to it on my iPod.
 And this is what Graham says.
  </li><li>You know, being in prophetic ministry
 for just over a hundred years, so it seems.
 I've come to understand that wisdom
 is more important than prophecy.
 It's a bit like if you were standing in a huge warehouse
 and everything was pitch black
 and someone just turned one light on, that's prophecy.
 It's just a light in the dark and it's a spotlight.
 But wisdom is when all the lights come on.
 And I've grown to appreciate the need is for us.
 We need to be prophetic, but we need to be wise.
  </li><li>And I thought when I heard that,
 because again, at that stage of my life,
 all I wanted to do was learn how to prophesy,
 grow on the prophetic gift,
 just such a hunger for the prophetic.
 And so here's one of my heroes,
 who's a legit prophet saying,
 I love prophecy, but wisdom's better.
 And I remember something in my heart going,
 okay, well then I will switch.
 I no longer wanna be a prophet, I now wanna be wise.
 And I just, you know, here's my problem.
 I didn't know how it become wise.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Like, do you go to school for it?
 Do you go to college?
 Like, what do you do?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But that thing, I remember it.
 Like being on the treadmill,
 and I remember just in my heart going,
 okay, I am going to, with all of my hunger
 and all my passion and all of the fuel
 and the research I've done to grow in the prophetic,
 I'm gonna apply all of that to the best of my ability
 to grow in wisdom.
 I really want to be wise.
 So this podcast, talking about, you know,
 in wisdom is us sharing the stuff that we've learned being around really wise people.
 What were you going to say there?
 Well, I was going to say, I also think like obviously the Lord has an enormous value on
 us operating in wisdom because wisdom is on offer for us to have, right?
 So we're to ask for it.
 We're encouraged to ask for it.
 But I was also thinking about Solomon in first Kings when he, when the Lord says to him,
 what do you want?
 Like, and what is your heart's desire?
 He could have asked for anything and he asked for wisdom and discernment.
 And as a result, the Lord's like, I'm so happy that you asked for that.
 I'm going to give you all these other things in addition, but because the
 Lord was so happy that he'd asked for wisdom.
 And to me, that's just like a week and ask we can, we can keep asking and we
 should keep asking.
 I think the only time we get into danger is when we become confident that we
 are the, we're so wise.
 Like I've got this now, like I don't, I don't need input.
 And we do the very thing we're told not to, which is lean on our own understanding,
 right, which is the antithesis of wisdom.
 Right.
 I remember Isabel, one of my favorite people in the whole planet, right?
 One of the most amazing prophets that we have alive today.
 Yeah.
 I remember her saying there's a danger that you reach in prophetic ministry,
 where you cease inquiring of the Lord and you begin to trust your own voice.
 Right.
 So people come to you and say, Hey, you know, would you pray for me about this?
 And instead of giving them the word of the Lord, you give them what you think
 is right or you go with your gut or you go with your feeling.
 And she said, we are not to do that.
 We're all asth in choir of the Lord,
 no matter how confident we are in our answer.
 And I was like, wow, like that.
 I see the same thing with wisdom.
 There's a danger that you get so confident or so skilled
 or you become a professional in an area
 where you think you've got the answer
 and that's where we become false.
  </li><li>Right, well, it's the thing that I think we said
 a week or two ago, like we actually never want to live from, I have arrived.
 We want to live.
 Absolutely.
 It's still in a place of being teachable and saying, Lord, can you help me with this?
 You know, can you give me wisdom?
 When we're talking about wisdom, I want to talk about four different types of wisdom.
 I'm sure there's more classifications than that, but I just want to think about
 these four types of wisdom and then just talk about some stories that we've encountered
 with those four types of wisdom.
 The four types of wisdom is number one, wisdom from experience.
 Number two, the wisdom you get from others.
 Number three, wisdom from above.
 And then number four, the gift of wisdom.
 Yeah.
 So that sounds good.
 Yeah.
 I want to talk with us.
 Yeah.
 So number one is really easy, wisdom from experience.
 Wisdom from experience is the most expensive kind of wisdom to acquire
 because you pay enormous amounts in school fees.
 Yes. And the school fees are you making a ton of mistakes and hopefully learning from them.
 And the problem with that is the wisdom only comes in hindsight. You have to make a ton of
 mistakes. I remember when I was learning how to be a teacher, my professor at the time said,
 "experience plus reflection equals learning." Yes. And I would say that like just because you make
 mistakes, it doesn't make you wise. You actually have to learn from it. And again, understanding
 in what we said before, any wisdom that I may acquire, that we may have with regard to
 managing people, in part has come from all of the colossal mistakes that we have made.
 Some practicing on other people.
 Managing people on doing the wrong thinking would know what we're doing,
 leaning on our own understanding. Same thing with money. I mean, you know, it's hysterical
 that the last couple of years the Lord's had me teach on finances where we have personally
 screwed up spectacularly with finances. Even though we've had great resources, which we're
 going to talk about in a second, but there is an experiential wisdom that doesn't come
 by default. It has to come by you paying your dues of realizing, "Oh, I screwed up." And
 I think that's a part of maturity when you own your mistakes, rather than blaming other
 people. When you blame other people, you don't take stock of what happened and you don't
 actually learn anything.
 Well, I think at that point that that wisdom and quotation marks probably become cynicism
 more than wisdom.
 Like I think we all have that choice no matter what our life experiences to go through it
 and learn from it or go through it and form judgments become cynical, become bitter.
 And we still think we're wise like we're like, Oh no, I'm wise.
 I mean, I know I've been through this and this and this before and this is what's going
 to happen.
 And again, I think that that's part of like what you're saying with Isabelle.
 Like we don't ever want to disconnect from the Holy Spirit being able to still bring hope
 into a situation.
 Do you know what I mean?
 Like I think you we don't ever want to fully rely on I've been through similar situations.
 And so here is my wisdom.
 We want to go.
 I've been through this.
 It feels like this.
 Is it this Lord?
 Right.
 Is it like we're still in?
 Do you know what I mean?
 Yeah, I do know.
 We all the time constantly still requiring.
 We're turning back to him.
 Yeah, you saying that reminds me of some of the experience I witnessed at Seich Hill,
 the people who were running the group therapy I went to, I would sit with these really,
 really mature therapist, counselors, experts in their field.
 And I would ask them questions about a situation or a dynamic and they would say, well, how
 would I know?
 And I'm like, because you're a freaking expert, this is what you do for a living.
 And they're like, I couldn't possibly begin to know
 without knowing more.
 And that was just this beautiful display of wisdom
 that they weren't interested in making themselves
 look like Yoda or these ultra-wise, you know.
  </li><li>Yoda's not fashionable really anymore anyway.
  </li><li>No, but it was a beautiful display of humility
 that they weren't confident in their own ability.
 They were like, well, I'd need to hear the other side
 and I'd need to be with them and we need to explore them.
 And I was like, well, that's remarkable.
 What about parenting?
 We were talking earlier about the stages of parenting
 and wisdom with the different number of kids we've had.
  </li><li>Well, I think I've learned that you really don't know
 anything, like on one level, you know,
 because each kid is different.
 Just like each person is different.
 So the second that you're like,
 well, it worked for this one,
 so it's gonna work for that one.
 Again, without the Holy Spirit involved, you're in trouble,
 right? - Ah, yeah.
  </li><li>But you do gain, you do gain like, you know,
 Certainly by the time you get to child number three,
 you're like, okay, I've done this stage two times before.
 And you do have some rough wisdom,
 like some general ideas of,
 I'm gonna head in this direction and maybe not do that.
 So we practiced on Abby way more than on Tia.
 And MJ's probably got it easy, right?
  </li><li>I constantly apologize to Abby.
 Like, babe, I'm so sorry, you're my first teenager.
 I really don't know what I'm doing.
  </li><li>Right, and we're trying to make the best decisions we've had.
  </li><li>And so she's always like, why do you get to this?
 like, because we learned that doing it this way with you didn't work.
 Right.
 And again, wisdom that comes from experience.
 Right. But I would say it's still wisdom in partnership with the Holy Spirit, or it's not,
 it just becomes like a knowledge that isn't necessarily always accurate.
 I don't know if this is cruel or just the kindness from God.
 Yeah.
 But as a pastor, one of the funnest things for me, and this is this is introducing my six
  </li><li>Are you allowed to say funnest or do we have to say most fun?
  </li><li>I don't know, I can do what I want.
 Is watching people who don't yet have kids
 be experts on parenting?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>You know, so they don't have kids.
 And you can't teach them anything.
 It's like, oh, okay, yeah, I love that you've got a birth plan.
 That's wonderful.
 And then they have a kid and typically their plan doesn't go
 or you see them after they've just had a baby
 and they're like, this is horrible.
 We're not sleeping like nothing. We've read work and we're like, yeah, it's hard.
 Welcome to the club.
 It's really hard.
 So again, I don't know if that's my sixth sense of humor, but we went through that.
 We were all like, yeah, we had a birth plan and that didn't work.
 Nope.
 And anyway, so like, I think that's why grandparents must be the happiest
 people in the world.
 Oh, yeah.
 Cause they're just like, oh, you're adorable.
 You think you're experts already?
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 What's wisdom from experience?
 The second type of wisdom I want to talk about is wisdom from others.
 Here's the irony with wisdom from others.
 When you will accept wisdom from others,
 you save yourself pain.
 So you would think that we all want it,
 but it's the type of wisdom that we're most resistant to.
  </li><li>Right, well, it requires humility, doesn't it?
  </li><li>It does.
 And so when people give wisdom that isn't asked for,
 it falls to the floor,
 and the person who didn't receive it
 can't recognize that as folly yet.
 But one of the things that we have learned to do
 is ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask.
  </li><li>Right, so you've just touched on two different things.
 We are people who ask for wisdom.
 Now, we ask specific people that we have observed
 their lives, the fruit of their lives.
 They're, you know, they're ahead of you.
 And you're going to them and going, talk to me.
  </li><li>I'm going to this venture.
  </li><li>You don't have a clue what I'm doing.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>What advice do you have for me?
  </li><li>Right.
 And then you're listening to hear,
 but you also mentioned,
 sometimes people are trying to offer you wisdom
 that you didn't ask for.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And that also, sometimes that happens.
 And I still think, like I used to,
 when I was super immature,
 take that kind of wisdom, you know,
 when it was coming from the people I didn't ask for.
 I'd just be like,
  </li><li>Yeah, finally.
  </li><li>I didn't ask you to speak into my life.
 But then when I go to the Holy Spirit with it,
 he would be like, "Well, actually, do you wanna talk about this?
 Like, do you actually wanna know?"
  </li><li>'Cause that's an untouchable spirit.
  </li><li>Right.
 So I think both have tremendous value.
 We live in pursuit of receiving wisdom
 from those within trusted community.
 That's just how we've lived our lives.
 Every big decision we've ever made,
 we invite wisdom into it.
 Not assuming that we have all the wisdom,
 no matter how many dreams, visions, encounters,
 whatever we've had, but actually, oh wow,
 we need wisdom from outside of us.
 I would say also try and value the random encounters.
 Now some of them, again, sometimes you're gonna get
 wisdom and quotation marks that is like crazy stuff.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>But Holy Spirit knows that, so you can always go,
 Holy Spirit, what about this thing?
  </li><li>You mean don't dismiss the goods
 because the packaging's not to your like.
  </li><li>Right, and then sometimes like I've had the Lord say
 that wasn't me.
 like that person that said that, that was just, you know, get rid of that.
 Okay, great.
 I was thinking about the irony of people who have wisdom to share,
 but they might have an audience who doesn't want to hear it.
 So for example, we've been helped tremendously by the wisdom from Dave Ramsey.
 Okay.
 So Dave Ramsey, for those of you who don't know, Dave Ramsey actually lives here,
 but he is a national expert on personal finances.
 That's what he does for a living.
 He is a believer and he teaches people how to manage their wealth.
 And in some circles, he's very controversial, but we've.
 Oh, yeah.
 Well, as the story will, will tell.
 Sorry.
 Great.
 Okay.
 So Dave's super helpful.
 He's all about like living debt free, getting rid of credit cards and
 how to manage your wealth and, you know, so on and so forth.
 It's certainly not the way 99% of the people are living.
 But I remember we were doing Dave Ramsey.
 We'd never heard of him, but we'd heard of something called the Financial Peace
 university, we did it. It started our journey of understanding all the mistakes we'd made.
 So we've done Dave Ramsey and I remember being with a friend one day talking about what we're
 learning about Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University and my friend like scoffs like Dave
 Ramsey, like what does he know? And just by that whole attitude, it's like Dave's got it all wrong.
 Now, the irony is my friend just filed for bankruptcy.
 Wow.
 Personal finance is so bad filed for bankruptcy.
 And here he is critiquing a person who also filed for bankruptcy, like Dave Ramsey had
 was absolutely broke, went broke.
 And the reason he's got wisdom is from the first category, personal experience.
 And is now a noted expert.
 And I was like, how, how sad that the same wisdom is available to me and to my friend.
 But you have to have ears to hear.
 Yeah.
 But also sometimes wisdom requires work.
 I think sometimes we don't want wisdom because it requires a response
 on the other side that that equals effort.
 And we would much prefer the wisdom that requires no effort than the wisdom that
 requires effort.
 Right.
 I'm not saying that about that particular situation.
 I'm just saying for myself, sometimes I'm like, I can think of times I've done that.
 Yeah.
 You're the wisdom I'm receiving, even though, oh, I know that's probably true.
 this is actually going to require more of me than if you had said, no, you're good.
 Yeah. Wisdom that's left in theory, spoils quickly.
 Yeah. You know, the stuff you need to know to do and you don't do it is like, uh, which brings us neatly to number three,
 which is the wisdom from above. You were quoting James earlier, Booker James. You know, if any of you lacks wisdom,
 you should ask God who gives freely without reproach. You know, and he'd love to give it to you.
 wisdom from above. Here's the thing, that wisdom in my experience, we think it's
 going to be academic. Oh Lord, would you please give me wisdom? And we think it's
 going to be like a cheat sheet for an answer. But what I found is when I asked
 the Lord for wisdom, the implementation of that wisdom comes in the form of
 obedience. Yeah. So it's not like a direct and obedient, not yeah. Right. And it's
 exactly what you say. Sometimes I don't want to do what he's saying. And I thought
 you were just gonna give me like an answer,
 not actually a direction or an instruction.
 Jesus taught about this amazing verse of things,
 Matthew 11, I've got to write it down, Matthew 11, 19,
 where he talks about wisdom is proved right by her children.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Like wisdom is only wisdom once you walk out
 and you see the fruit of wisdom in action.
 And I think that in our life,
 the times that we've sought wisdom from the Lord
 has required a walking out to it.
 Oh yeah, for sure.
 And sometimes you don't see, well, most times
 you don't actually see the fruition
 of what you had asked for the wisdom for
 until you've been obedient to the things
 that are part of the stages of walking it out.
  </li><li>And then sometimes God throws in faith into the mix too.
 So won't tell you what it will be,
 just expects you to obey.
  </li><li>Well, often.
  </li><li>And you know, he's never like,
 okay, well, I understand this is tricky.
 Let me explain the long play here.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>To do this and then this and then this and then
 about 20 years time, that he doesn't.
 He's just like, "Okay, here's the wisdom from heaven.
 "You can take it or leave it if you'd like."
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>All right, well, the last kind of wisdom
 is one of my favorite kinds of wisdom,
 but it doesn't really benefit us.
 And what I mean by that is--
  </li><li>I mean us, like you and me.
  </li><li>No, I mean whoever has it.
 I'm gonna talk about the gift of wisdom.
  </li><li>Oh, the gift of wisdom, yeah.
  </li><li>When God gives you the gift of wisdom,
 I used to think the gift of wisdom would be for me,
 but gift of wisdom is for others via me.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Right, again, I'm not setting myself up
 as this kind of why Sage.
 What I mean is as leaders,
 we're constantly being asked to make decisions.
 We're constantly asked for input
 about stuff that's way above our pay scale.
 You know, like, what do you think I should do
 in this situation?
 You know, and we're like, I don't know.
 But it's our job, not necessarily to know
 it's our job to be with people.
 And so often I'm amazed that people will ask me questions
 that are beyond my pay grade, beyond my training,
 beyond my intellect, beyond my understanding.
 And as I ask the Lord to give me food,
 to feed his children, I will give an answer
 and I am astonished by the answer,
 not because of my amazing intellect or understanding,
 but because I'm hearing myself say things,
 I'm like, "Dang, that's good.
 "I should write that down for me for later."
 And it's the gift of wisdom operating.
 Again, nothing to do with me,
 it's just a gift of the Holy Spirit
 that is flowing through me for others.
 And it's a bit like the gift of prophecy in that,
 you know, the prophets I know can prophesy over others,
 they rarely get revelation for themselves.
 So having the gift of wisdom helps your community
 more than it does help you.
  </li><li>Right, well, and I would say we've seen it
 in a couple of other places.
 Like what you're talking about,
 you sit down one on one and the Lord, you know,
 but I've had like, and I know you have as well,
 I've had times where I'm preaching, I mid-preach,
 I planned out everything I'm gonna say,
 it's all in my notes and something else starts
 coming out in the middle of it,
 and I'm literally like, somebody write that down.
 I didn't, you know, and you know it wasn't you.
 It was just you speaking out, you know,
 what you were getting in the moment,
 or when we've done stuff like question and answer times
 at the school. - At the school, oh my God.
  </li><li>And I would always get like super nervous.
 I mean, I'd be confident that you would have
 wisdom to answer, you know, or Tony or Jeff,
 like depending on who was there.
 But I'd always be like, oh dear,
 here we go, question and answer.
 And even though we do them all the time,
 But like every time the Lord would be like,
 "Hey, say this, hey, remember this?
 "Hey, remember, you know."
 So it's really fun to actually operate in wisdom.
 Okay, so this is great, but let's do some practical.
 If I know you, you have five easy steps.
  </li><li>It just so happens, I do have five easy steps.
  </li><li>I'm getting wisdom, four and a half.
 All right, hit us with number one.
  </li><li>Well, it depends what kind of wisdom you want.
 Do you want earthly wisdom?
 You really don't, or worldly wisdom,
 you read on, you won't wisdom from heaven.
 So if you want to grow in wisdom,
 these are steps that come straight from scripture,
 but number one, start with the Bible.
 Proverbs four verse five says this,
 get wisdom, get understanding.
 Like that's your first starting point.
 Have a hunger and have a desire for it.
 And then it goes on and says,
 do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth.
 So the Bible is chock full of wisdom.
 Elsewhere in Proverbs it says,
 One man's way seems right to another presents this case.
 If you're only feeding yourself on opinion,
 if you're only feeding yourself on editorial comment,
 you will find that your heart and your mind
 will be shaped by the world.
 You must allow the Lord an opportunity to speak to your heart
 to keep the plum line of your soul correct.
 So one man's way seems right.
 You can listen to like a documentary
 or read like I said in an editorial and it's like,
 "Oh yeah, that sounds great."
 And if you're not careful, you're succumbing
 to earthly wisdom, which only has limits
 and will ultimately lead you to error.
 But if you will devote yourself to scripture,
 you will find a source of incredible wisdom.
 But here's the thing, the Bible, it can't be just reading.
 Like you can't be reading the Bible.
 It has to be lived out because the word is living
 and it has power.
 And when you put into practice what you are learning,
 that's how you grow in wisdom.
 I know many, many people who've got an amass of biblical knowledge,
 but they haven't become wise.
 You become wise by doing what the word says.
 What are you going to say?
 I also was thinking, and I don't know if this is one of your four and a half
 points or not, but throw out.
 We'll see.
 Um, just check your list.
 Uh, I was also thinking like scripture encourages us to seek wisdom.
 And seeking takes longer than just seeing something.
 You know what I mean?
 So seeking is look for it, put effort into finding it.
 don't assume the thing that's right in front of your face
 is what is wisdom.
 But actually spend the time to look for what's deeper,
 what's there.
 So I was also thinking that.
 I think sometimes we, again, we have become
 such a fast food culture and we want everything delivered
 instantly.
 And Uber eats on wisdom, please.
 Like a million different comics have said,
 we get frustrated when something doesn't
 load on our page, on our phone right away,
 and we're like, hey, that's going to space and back,
 you know, like maybe you could like chill.
 But we're kind of like that.
 I think even with seeking wisdom from the Lord.
 And I think there's something valuable in waiting
 for wisdom and seeking wisdom,
 rather than we don't ever want to live
 from a stance of demanding wisdom.
  </li><li>Well, this is how prophetic you are
 'cause number two was exactly that.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>All right, and I was thinking about
 the first world we're talking about.
 And James like, seek out wisdom, ask for it.
 God says you're welcome to ask for it
 in James chapter one, if any of you lacks wisdom,
 you should ask God.
 You can also ask people because you hear God's voice
 through the council of many,
 and the multitude of counselors, there's wisdom,
 it says in scripture or safety.
 And so I think about all the big moves
 that we have made in our life.
 Every major transition we have gone to our leaders
 and sat down with them and said,
 "This is what we feel like the Holy Spirit's saying to us.
 "What do you hear when we share this?
 "Does this reverberate?
 "Like what are you feeling?"
 every single move that we've done.
 And practical things like buying a house,
 or I remember speaking to my friend Bill
 about buying a car, like, hey, Bill,
 like we have two cars right now,
 we've got an aging minivan, which has been so good to us.
  </li><li>It's a miracle van at this point.
  </li><li>It's a miracle van.
 And we have your little--
  </li><li>Sportage.
  </li><li>Sportage, like a little mini four by four.
 We need to replace our minivan,
 the amount of work we need to do on it.
 And so I went to my friend, Bill,
 Who's like bought cars before?
 I don't.
 He knows more about cars.
 I don't.
 And I said, Bill, can you help me?
 I'm thinking of doing this.
 But what's the wisdom?
 I'm thinking, do we just shove some money into repair it?
 Or is that good money after bad?
 Should we get a new one?
 I don't really want to lease a car because I've done
 Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University.
 But do I lease?
 Do we buy just to replace the one we have with another one
 of a similar-- or do we save up?
 Or more like, what do we do?
 And he told us-- he gave me so many options
 I hadn't even thought of.
 I was like, Bill, like, how do you know all the stuff?
 He said, because I've literally made every mistake
 under the sun when by a car,
 I've literally done all of the options you've talked about.
 And I can tell you what worked for me.
 And I was like, how much heartache and finance
 did that save us having that conversation?
  </li><li>There's a cheeky part of me that wants to say, babe,
 I remember we were having a conversation.
 I was like, we don't put more money into this minivan.
 We just don't, it's not worth it.
 And you were like, well, I'm not sure I'm not sure.
 Then you came back from meeting with Bill that morning.
 and you're like, Bill said not to do it.
 And I was like, well--
 Didn't I say not to do it?
 OK, sure.
 OK.
 Bill.
 I'm fine with that.
 Bill has the experience of buying lots more cars than you
 have.
 But wisdom is always spoken of in the feminine.
 So maybe I should have gotten some sort of--
 Also true.
 Yeah.
 Well, so that was number two.
 Ask for it.
 Number three is hang out with wise people.
 You become the common denominator of the people
 you connect with.
 Absolutely.
 This is one of the things we've told people.
 all the time. Like we have spent a large portion of our ministry,
 pastoring young adults, people in their twenties and thirties.
 And I say this to them all the time,
 the wisdom that you are looking for will not be found to the left or you're
 right. Like rarely will you ever find wisdom you need from your peers.
 You need to find the wisdom in the generation above you,
 people who are further ahead of you in the area that you need wisdom.
 So I mean, people all the time who their version of wisdom is like,
 I'm thinking of doing this dumb decision to the sound good to you.
 sense of great bro, you should totally do it. And they think, I
 went and saw wisdom, like, you saw wisdom from somebody who is
 unable to dress themselves, like what will you expect that you
 are going to get? So it was zero life experience. So hang out
 with wise people cultivate multi generational relationships,
 you can offer wisdom to people who are below you in life
 experience or in age and cultivate. That's one of the things
 I'm so grateful for is relationships that we have with
 Moms and dads of the faith or even people who are not moms and dads, but are people who are mature in the faith
 Well, that's what I was gonna say like I was just thinking about like, you know
 You and I right now are in a process where we're seeking wisdom about some stuff that we're, you know thinking about and
 And so we have gone to a couple of couples that are older than us that are further along
 And we've said hey give us wisdom
 And then we have other couples in our lives that are other people that we'll seek for wisdom now
 they're in the same age bracket as we are.
  </li><li>Some of them are younger than us.
  </li><li>Some of them are younger than us.
 But why is in the Lord?
 And able to be truthful, whether you want to hear it or not.
  </li><li>Yeah, they know us well.
 I love us faithfully enough to say no.
 That's a dumb decision.
  </li><li>And they have the character and everything
 to be able to go, yes, like I can hear from you.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Yeah.
  </li><li>And then number four, do what you know is right.
 So here's the thing, revelation should lead to obedience.
 Like you never want to be so full of revelation that you don't actually do
 anything with it.
 Revelation leads to obedience.
 When you obey, you get wisdom.
 Right.
 Like that's a progressive thing.
 So you learn as you go.
 Don't, don't treat your wisdom as empty theory.
 You actually have to live out.
 You actually have to apply it.
 No point in doing a Dave Ramsey financial piece university.
 Yeah.
 And then not doing anything that he told you to do.
 Yeah, I don't understand why I'm still in debt.
 I did Dave Ramsey's financial piece.
 Yeah, it wasn't the doing that was important.
 It was the exercising of what you learn.
 Well, I think I don't know if I want to say everything in the kingdom, but let's
 say most things in the kingdom seem to require action or response.
 Right.
 And again, as you say, often the reason we didn't get a result is because we
 digested the information, but didn't actually take it through to response or action.
 And then we're like, well,
 It didn't work. It didn't work.
 Well, but you didn't do it.
 So I said I had four and a half points.
 Like, Oh, what's your half point?
 Well, my half point is none of that works without humility
 because a prerequisite for wisdom is humility.
 Yes. And it and the humility is not a one time thing.
 It's not like and I humbled myself. So I'm sad. No, like you have to continue
 to lean on your own understanding.
 And that's hard because the more wise you become an inverted commas,
 the more track record you've got to trust.
 But the mistake is it wasn't your track record
 that got you thus far.
 It was the Holy Spirit's grace.
 Don't confuse his kindness with your brilliance.
 Like that will end in error.
 So don't be the expert in the room.
 For the rest of your life,
 just continue to ask, ask, ask, ask, ask.
 That's one of the things that I love being with John and Carol.
 And they'd, I hopefully they never got exhausted.
 I asked them about everything.
 Like I'm confident I got wisdom from them.
 I've never heard them preach and I've never read in any other books, right?
 Because I would just ask, it's what the disciples did.
 How come we couldn't deliver that?
 You know, right?
 Oh, this can't tell you learn.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So they go wisdom, wisdom, wisdom.
 It's super awesome.
 It's super great.
 It's super unsexy, but it's the most valuable thing.
 I think you can amass while you're here on earth.
 So pursue wisdom with everything that you can and go for it.
 AJ Jones.
 Yes.
 I've got a listeners question that is straight up your street.
 Oh, dear.
 OK, I'm ready.
 Oh, dear.
 Every week we take questions from our listeners.
 If you've got a question you want to ask,
 it can be about something we've said on the show.
 It's something that's always bugged you.
 Just something completely new.
 If you've got a question, send it to alanonaj.com/ask,
 and we will do our best to answer questions.
 I'm just wondering what my street is, because it's up my street.
 OK, talk to me about my street.
 OK.
 How do you know when you need deliverance?
 Wow. I mean, it's a good question.
 Great question.
 Great question.
 Probably at some point, every Christian needs deliverance
 and probably at more than one point.
 Well, hold on though, because I remember never realizing
 that Christians could need deliverance,
 because I'm a Christian.
 How could I possibly have a demon?
 Right.
 Well, and I think people get stuck on the possession
 versus oppression kind of thing.
 Like, well, is the demon in me or on me?
 Well, can a Christian have a demon?
 Sure, a Christian can have anything they want, right?
 Yeah, Derek Prince's name is fine.
 Who is a deliverance guy.
 Expert.
 Yeah.
 I think sometimes we've unknowingly made a home for the demonic.
 Right.
 Many, many times because of childhood things, because of hurts, because of all that kind of stuff.
 Do we need deliverance?
 Yes.
 Is it in you or on you?
 I think it's on.
 I think it's on you.
 I think it's oppressive from the outside rather than in you because the Holy Spirit is in you.
 So in a nutshell, Christians can't be possessed by a demon.
 You're already possessed by the Holy Spirit.
 But certainly he can try and influence.
 Yeah, you can absolutely be afflicted or oppressed by demons.
 So when we're talking about deliverance for a Christian,
 which is the best kind of deliverance, it's removing the power
 that demons have to operate in your life,
 either by afflicting you with sickness or with poverty or with suicidal thoughts
 or oppression or tormenting you with thoughts that you don't want
 or behavior that's uncommon to you, you know, reactionary behavior that's uncommon to you can
 sometimes be demonically empowered behavior, that kind of stuff. So what would be some of the
 signs that like, oh, it'd probably be good for me to get some deliverance. Well, probably if
 you're even thinking that, it would probably be good to go and get some deliverance like,
 just seriously, though, like if you're like, I wonder if I, you know, if that's come into your head,
 that actually might be the Holy Spirit saying, hey, yeah, but what if you're, what if you're a
 spiritual hyper contract.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>Like I'm just thinking--
  </li><li>Well go get deliverance for that.
 (laughing)
 That's not gonna be good either.
  </li><li>I'm just thinking like, you know, 25 years ago
 if I heard this podcast I'd be like, wait,
 Christians can be demonically oppressed,
 like we'll get them off me,
 where you know, like I would probably be freaked out by that.
  </li><li>Right, well I would probably say like to journal
 and ask the Holy Spirit about it
 and go to the people that know you
 that are wise around you.
 experts people with yeah don't go to a like a lone ranger who's like I have a
 deliverance ministry I've seen this done once before don't do that yeah but
 there's plenty of actually great inner healing and deliverance ministries and
 I would say those two are best done together much better because because
 the inner healing gets rid of the structure that allows the demonic to
 stay. And so the deliverance usually is just a lot.
 When Paul writes, do not give the devil a foothold. The word
 their foothold comes from a Greek word, "topos," which where
 we get our word topology, like a spot. Don't give the devil a
 spot or a license or a place to operate. And so when we do
 deliverance, the reason in our healing is great is you remove
 the structure, be it an inner vow and ungodly belief, a
 judgment, bitterness, rage, anger, all those things. If you
 know, if we habitually sin, we give opportunity, it's like rolling a red carpet for the enemy
 to take up residence. And so that's why those two go hand in hand. Probably one of the most
 effective ministries I know on the planet would be restoring the foundations. Yes.
 Who would, we've been through that. And, you know, go to, but that's the thing, like we went for
 a week of ministry not thinking, here's a list of demons I need to get rid of. Right. And yet they
 they got rid of a bunch of demons.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So, you know, I don't want to be flipping,
 but like I think everybody needs deliverance.
  </li><li>Oh, for sure at some point after you get saved,
 you're going to need deliverance.
 But I think it's on to you.
  </li><li>How much deliverance have you had
 before we went to see the kill list?
  </li><li>Oh, tons.
  </li><li>So much deliverance.
  </li><li>So much deliverance.
  </li><li>I had tons of deliverance.
 And yet we experienced more deliverance.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So.
  </li><li>How do you know when you deliverance?
  </li><li>You probably do.
 You know, it's seriously.
  </li><li>But it's way less scary than, you know,
 we're smiling and joking about it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, I hope that's not traumatic for everybody to listen
 to this, you'll be fine.
 One of the primary reasons that Jesus came
 was to seek and save the lost.
 And one of the major portions of Jesus' ministry
 was deliverance on earth.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And it wasn't a scary part of his administration.
 It was, you know, everyday life for him.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I wonder how many of the people who got delivered
 in the New Testament thought they needed delivered.
  </li><li>Many of them are coming down for healing
 and it's deliverance instead.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>Why don't you just do some mass deliverance prayer?
 I'm kidding, let's not do that.
 So again, if you got questions, send them to allenajay.com/ask.
 We would love to try and answer them.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Well, okay, if you want the show notes
 for this week's episode, go to allenajay.com/235.
 I momentarily forgot what episode it was.
  </li><li>Good heavens.
 with just two quick things to tell you about.
 Adrijons.
 Well, I think because we were just talking about healing and deliverance.
 And we actually wanted to let you know in case you are new to the podcast or you
 have maybe not thought about it in a while.
 We actually have Alan and I teach.
 I'm the director of something called the School of Supernatural Life.
 It's amazing.
 And it's amazing.
 It's an eight month school.
 There's an option to come back for a second year and a third year, but it's,
