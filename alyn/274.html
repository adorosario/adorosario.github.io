<p> Island and AJ's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Mrs. AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes, sir.<br/>
 Episode 274.<br/>
 It is.<br/>
 Of keeping up with the Joneses.<br/>
 Give us a weekly catch up.<br/>
 Well, for me, it was a lighter week<br/>
 because I didn't teach on the school.<br/>
 So I almost felt like, what do I do with my hands?
 Well, did you end up doing with your hands?
 Just all my other jobs.<br/>
 I think the most important story you need to tell this week is how I
 outgenius the genius at the Apple store.
 You did.<br/>
 Thank you. Tell the good people.<br/>
 Tell the good people.<br/>
 My AirPod pros stopped working.<br/>
 Well, the right ear stopped working.<br/>
 And to be fair, you were your AirPod pros every day.
 All the time. Yeah.<br/>
 So I use them all the time.<br/>
 And I have had them for about three years.
 Anyway, they stopped working.<br/>
 Of course you have to call first and you go through all this like on the phone,
 "Hey, do this, do that, do this, do that."
 Did all those things still weren't working.
 And of course then they were like, "Bring it into the Genius Bar."
 So I do that a sweet girl named Chi came over to help me.
 You remember her name?<br/>
 Yeah. Anyway, she said they have a special box that they put it in in the back.
 How much do you want to bet that I wanted to see the special box?
 You wanted to see it.<br/>
 I wanted to see it after she talked about it.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And the special box like tests both the case
 and or maybe that's a different box that tests the case.
 And then the sound quality and their connectivity
 and all that kind of stuff of the AirPods.
 So she comes back, I don't know, 10 minutes later,
 15 minutes later, you went and got me a coffee
 and came back, it was a while.
</p><ul>
  <li>I won't, the Starbucks came back, yeah.
 It was--
  </li><li>Well, they were having problems.
 The box thing wasn't working and then--
  </li><li>What was blaming on the box?
  </li><li>Anyway, they came back and said, right.
 So actually neither of them actually connect properly
 and the right one is dead.
 And so you need a new--
  </li><li>'Cause you couldn't charge the right one at all.
 Not either in my case,
 they're just dead to the world.
 No sound came out of it.
 No connectivity, no charging.
  </li><li>Nothing, very, very sad.
 Anyway, so we're like, huh,
 that's a whole bunch of money we don't want to spend right now.
 So we're like, okay, thank you.
  </li><li>So it was out of warranty.
 So they said, either buy a new set for $260 or buy a replacement set, which won't have a warranty for 180 or something.
 And so we were like, yeah, neither.
 And you sweetly said I could use your AirPod pros.
 Well, I just, I see AirPods pro going to sale all the time.
 Apple often doesn't discount their stuff, but you can like, I think we walked out of the store and found them at Best Buy for 180, didn't we?
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 For a new one with a case.
  </li><li>No, obviously I don't really want to spend $108.
 We have multiple sets of headphones, you can use mine.
 And I had a sneaking suspicion I might be able to fix yours.
 What I lack in the ability to deal with anything mechanical
 like a lawnmower or a car engine,
 God gifted me with an insane level of confidence
 that I'll probably be able to figure it out with his computer.
  </li><li>So sure enough, we get home.
 You give me your AirPod Pros so that I can like MOSI
 and clean and whatnot while listening to things.
 And then you said, "Just give me your ones
 "that aren't working."
 And wasn't very long later that you were like,
 "Here's your AirPods back and they work."
  </li><li>And for those of you wondering what I did,
 I really didn't do anything technical.
 I just Googled, "How do you factory reset AirPod Pros?"
 Which you just opened the case
 and hold down the back button for 15 seconds.
 And I did that and then fully charged them
 and then they worked.
  </li><li>But I had done that.
 I had done that with the guy on the phone.
  </li><li>I don't know, things just about--
  </li><li>They do.
  </li><li>Oh, well, and then like later on,
 they weren't working again.
 So I brought them back and I was like, babe,
 they're making some weird clicking sound
 and you put them in your ears
 and I don't even know what you did.
 Press two buttons.
 So you're like, there you go.
 They work again.
 I'm like, you know what?
  </li><li>Well, we'll see how long this lasts.
 I think they are on their last legs.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>They don't really owe you anything.
  </li><li>No, they've, nothing.
  </li><li>You've literally used them every day
 for several hours a day for three years.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Anyway, I felt redeemed as a husband to that point.
  </li><li>Maybe you did great.
  </li><li>Thanks.
 Let's talk about our weather.
 the weather is insane.
  </li><li>Okay, wasn't the church this morning,
 and Pastor Jeff said, have you seen the--
  </li><li>Did he send it to you?
 Because it's so funny. - Yeah, I just,
 I googled it. - Okay.
  </li><li>Tennessee has 12 seasons.
 Winter, full spring, second winter, spring of deception,
 third winter, the pollining, actual spring,
 summer, health front porch, false fall,
 second summer, actual fall.
  </li><li>That sounds about right.
 And we are in spring of deception right now.
  </li><li>We're in spring of deception.
 Or at least we were last week
 because it was 70 degrees.
  </li><li>Gorgeous weather.
  </li><li>Beautiful and the trees were all budding.
 My allergies were full on.
 And then Friday we get what four inches of snow?
  </li><li>Four inches of snow, yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then Saturday the sun comes out
 and pretty much melts everything.
  </li><li>Yes.
 And today it's supposed to be back up in the 50s.
 And then by Wednesday again,
 it'll be back into the seven.
 It's so confusing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So you had your AirPods fixed by a handsome Scotsman.
 We had snow.
 I taught at M&amp;8 last week.
  </li><li>You did?
  </li><li>So much fun.
 I haven't taught at M&amp;8 in a long time.
 And I specifically haven't taught on the prophetic.
 Like I used to teach at SSL on the prophetic
 and I haven't done it in how many years.
 You never teach it.
 So I got to teach on the prophetic,
 like how activate people in the gift,
 like kind of a beginner's guide to how the gift works.
 And I realized I was taught that
 by the Holy Spirit in my living room in Edinburgh,
 years and years and years ago.
 I remember, I remember sitting in my living room
 in my IKEA chair, and I remember,
 I'd been so confused, I didn't know how to prophesy
 and just asked the Lord, and he taught me
 from Jeremiah chapter one,
 and then 20 something years later,
 I'm teaching everybody on Monday.
 I had a lot of fun with that teaching people how to prophesy.
 I enjoyed that.
 Anything else happened this week?
 It wasn't much nicer weeks than last week.
  </li><li>We went bowling.
  </li><li>We did go bowling and I beat my high score.
  </li><li>What was your high score?
 What was my high score?
  </li><li>Well, my previous high score was 67.
  </li><li>Okay, a noble effort.
 What's that?
  </li><li>A noble effort 300.
  </li><li>I thought you were 100.
  </li><li>Pretty dreadful.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>But, ladies and gentlemen, I have a new high score.
  </li><li>You're not even gonna be enthusiastic, it was 98.
  </li><li>98.
  </li><li>98, 98.
  </li><li>We've got a lot of skilled bowlers on our staff.
  </li><li>We do.
  </li><li>Or really flooky.
  </li><li>We have some that showed up with their own bowling ball.
  </li><li>Yes, I sent them to the other end of the bowling.
  </li><li>That's serious, give it me.
 Yeah, you're not bowling with us.
 We like formed our lane based on all of us couldn't bowl
 and we just wanted to have fun.
 And so it looked like maybe several of our staff lanes
 were that scenario.
  </li><li>Yeah, I enjoyed it.
 Like I think the thing I like about bowling is
 you don't have to do much.
  </li><li>Yeah, you just throw up.
 Like every like two and a half minutes throw ball down.
 Not even it's like every five minutes.
 Oh, well, you thought we're all like, blah, blah, blah.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 And then, you know, hang out and eat pizza or yeah, pizza and Brussels sprouts.
 They had really good Brussels sprouts.
 Yeah. Our kids are down spring break.
 Spring.
 MJ had his spring performance.
 Didn't awesome job.
 He was so cute.
 And he played like a xylophone or something.
 Did he kept that from us?
 Yeah. It was.
 It was the big surprise.
 came out and there's our son center stage playing his ile phone.
 Was very sweet.
 Very, very sweet.
 Yeah. All right.
 Do you want our topic for this week?
 Yes.
 I wish I thought about doing this topic
 straight after when Ben was talking.
 OK, our friend Ben Jackson came on.
 He talked about seasons of transition.
 But we were having lunch today with some friends and we were just talking about
 like how how the seasons change.
 I don't mean like spring, summer,
 spring of deception.
 I don't mean those seasons.
 I mean, like, you know, how life changes.
 And you go through different seasons, maybe it's a job change, maybe it's moving house,
 maybe it's moving country, maybe it's a season with the Lord that changes for you.
 And we were talking about that and I just began thinking, like, I don't know if I'm
 wired, oddly, but I love change.
 I think you do too.
 I love, well, I suppose I like change more than some people.
 people. Yeah. Sometimes I don't like change. It depends. If I planned for change, then I feel
 fine about it. I've always, I think always love change. I love when God's up to the same. I don't
 know whether I just get bored with monotony. Well, I love when God's up to something. I don't just
 like change for change's sake. Yes, but you know, if you believe God is sovereign, then change for
 change is sake is actually change for the Lord's sake, because he rules everything.
  </li><li>Tricky.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>You know what I find the purposes of God at work?
 I get what you point, I get your point.
 Like I didn't like the season where you had a tumor
 growing inside you and was trying to get out
 and then you had to go for surgery.
 That wasn't a fun season of change.
  </li><li>Yeah, I love change.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>No, but by and large, when big change happens,
 I get excited about it.
 Don't you?
  </li><li>Yeah, I was just thinking,
 yay, five tiny scars.
 So look like I was attacked by Wolverine.
 I love change.
 Sorry.
  </li><li>Okay.
 Well, I guess it depends on what change you're talking about.
 When I think about the change that we've been through,
 like before I met you, the changes I went through,
 changes since we were married,
 I think one of the kind things of the Lord
 is he's always been gracious
 to tell us about the change before it happens.
 Now, to be fair, you don't always see
 that he's telling you about change heading into the change.
 Sometimes it's hindsight, isn't it?
 Oh, you totally were trying to give me heads up about that.
 That's what you were doing.
 But I was thinking about like change always comes with cost.
 But the cost of the cost or how much that cost hurts you,
 I think comes down to three different factors
 or three different criteria.
 Okay.
 As I reflect on it, I'm gonna suggest
 that the level of partnership we do with the Holy Spirit,
 how quickly we obey the Holy Spirit and how willing our heart is to engage with the process of change.
 How's that different from partnership?
 Well, I think about partnership being on the front end.
 So like one of the questions I was talking to our friends about a lunch is it comes from our own experience really is like often for me,
 the Lord has invited us to dream about an exesum even when we're not thinking about the next season.
 Yes, even when it seems like impossible or whatever.
 Right.
 And often it's very hard to dream into a future season when you're limited by the constraints
 of your present season.
 Or even the constraints of past seasons where you've been disappointed.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 Well, you don't realize that blinkers have been put on you through previous sets of disappointment.
 Yeah.
 So the Lord saying like, Hey, hey, dream about this.
 And we're like, No, no, I've done that before.
 That's, that's disappointing.
 And I think where the partnership comes in, there's a beautiful verse in Psalms 145 verse 16,
 where it says he opens his hand and satisfies the desires of every living thing. Sometimes the very
 desires that he wants to satisfy, we've killed because of the pain of not seeing those desires
 come to fruition. Or previous desires not coming to fruition. Or those ones who are just like,
 "Hey Lord, you said that this is a desire you want to satisfy. I think it's desire. I'm just
 I'm just gonna pack away, put it in the Alex
 and bury and bury and bury it.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And then what do we know about the Lord is actually,
 I wanna breathe on that.
 And in order for us to partner with him,
 we actually have to pull that out
 and allow the Lord to awaken that into a new desire.
 So when I think about like partnership with the Lord,
 it's often on the front end.
 So tell us, tell the story about us having to go,
 or not having to go,
 but being invited into how something
 when we lived in Toronto.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Well, okay, so this is in a season where we're completely
 living by faith.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>And so we have no income.
 Like if we were to go to the bank,
 they would be like, you don't have steady income.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Yes, that's true.
 But we felt like the Lord was saying,
 hey, I want you to go and dream about a house
 and what you'd like in a house and all that kind of stuff.
 And so we would go on Sunday afternoons after church.
 'Cause there'd be like open houses.
  </li><li>All the time.
 And we would walk through all of these sort of new built houses.
 A lot of times townhouses.
 What's the townhouse for people who don't know Toronto?
 Where they're, you know, like there's a row of houses all together.
 What would you call those in the UK?
 Tenements.
 Yeah.
 So, Richie?
 That's a Scottish phrase.
 Yeah, tenements.
 Yeah.
 So they're just like tall, skinny houses that are all kind of glued together for lack of a better way.
 Kind of bigger than an apartment.
 But yes.
  </li><li>In Britain we'd have semi-detached houses
 where it's like two houses joined together.
 Yes, but this is like a row of all these joined houses.
  </li><li>Right, yes.
  </li><li>And we call them?
  </li><li>We call them townhouses.
  </li><li>Townhouses.
  </li><li>Yeah, so there's townhouses.
 And then we went through some proper houses.
  </li><li>Townhouses are for your starter homes.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
 And most of them that we were looking at
 were good half an hour, 40 minutes outside of the city.
 But we were just sort of wildly dreaming
 'cause we felt like the Lord said to dream,
 but there was nothing in the natural
 that would have pointed towards this ever
 being a productive use of time.
  </li><li>But what was also, you described it as wildly dreaming
 until the Lord rebuked us.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Because the Lord was like,
 "Hey, I'm curious why you're looking
 "at the houses that you're looking at."
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And we were like, "Well, that's all we can afford."
 And the Lord was like,
 "Well, actually you can't afford anything."
  </li><li>Which was true.
 (laughs)
 But we were trying to keep to something we thought was reasonable.
 Well, that's the point he was trying to make is, you know, I didn't give you any price range.
 I just asked you to go dream and you automatically limited your dreaming to what you thought you could afford,
 which on paper you can't even afford.
 Right.
 So it was really interesting.
 Like here, here's something where the Lord's inviting us to dream about something was also curious,
 because with an inkling that we weren't going to end up in Canada anyway.
 Yeah, we weren't really sure where we would end up.
 Yeah.
 I think we were hoping it would be the United States.
 Like I remember, I remember filling in all my paperwork for, for citizenship for Canada.
 And I remember saying to you, I'm not sure why we're doing this when we both know we end up in America.
 So this weird season with the Lord inviting us to dream about a house.
 And now later we realize he was waking up our heart for a desire that he actually fulfilled
 in a different country, in a different season.
 Yeah. But still that driving around kind of confronted our limited thinking.
 Yeah. It also gave us a feel and a flavor and a hunger for what we'd eventually want.
 Yeah. Do you remember that when we came here to Franklin before we even knew we were moving here,
 we came to the very neighborhood we now live in? Yeah. Some friends of ours were driving us around
 and they brought us into this neighborhood and there was an open house and so we walked through
 one of the model homes that had basement and everything. And I remember saying to Alan, like,
 "Oh man, if we moved here, I would want to live here."
 Like this would be the dream.
  </li><li>And then the Lord in His kindness
 puts us right in the neighborhood that we were dreaming
 that we didn't even think would be a reality.
  </li><li>Like eight years later or something.
  </li><li>And I think it's all connected, I think.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And actually the house that the Lord gave us here
 is much nicer house than the one that we looked at.
 And I was saying, like this would be the dream.
 And even in that, it was like a way overshoot
 of like, oh, that's your dream.
 Let me just, let me just up that a little bit.
  </li><li>Yeah, I wanna encourage anybody who's listening to this
 and you're in a season of discontentment.
 The thing that I've come to learn
 about seasons of discontentment is
 it causes longing to rise in your heart.
 So you live in a season where you don't have the thing
 that you don't know you want yet,
 which is why you're discontent.
 And as you sit where you're discontentment,
 that longing arises in your heart
 and your Lord's like, oh, I'm glad to see that longing
 because that's the thing I'd like to open my hand
 and satisfy that desire.
  </li><li>Right, and the trickiness is to let yourself
 feel the longing and not get bitter
 or let your heart grow sick in the wading
 between recognizing a longing and the longing being fulfilled.
  </li><li>So when you talk about like, hey,
 what's the difference between partnership
 and being willing to obey?
 I think partnership is at the very early stages
 where you allow the Lord to woo your heart,
 to incubate for him to draw out things that he's put,
 you know, where's it, is it lamentations, ecclesiastes?
 The God's set eternity in the heart of men.
 The Lord's put something in us that he wants to satisfy,
 and the tension is usually the thing
 that he wants to satisfy in us
 is something we can't achieve on our own.
 And he puts us in circumstances
 where the thing that we're longing for,
 we can't bring forth.
 And that's the partnership of like, okay, Lord,
 I am yearning, longing, hungering for this thing.
 And the Lord's like, oh, I'm glad you're in touch with that.
 That's the very thing I would love to do with you,
 do for you, do through you in the season.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>I think that kicks in the partnership.
 I think I never knew that part of walking with the Lord.
 I just thought, I am a robot.
 Yes, Lord, give me my instructions and I will go do it.
 And you know, like I think when I met you,
 That was the beginning of the Lord helping me move
 from a robot mindset to a sunship mindset.
 Like I think when I approached the Lord
 about thinking about marrying you, it was like,
 should I?
 Yes or no, true or false?
 Is she my wife?
 And the Lord was like, well, hang on, like robot boy,
 can we back up and can you get in touch
 with the longing of your heart?
 Like what is it you're looking for?
 And I wasn't, you know, we were talking about this
 with Ben a couple of weeks ago.
 like the will of the Lord is wide, you know, like I think he said, a field.
 And you know, it's, it's, it's, it's something beautiful to, to explore.
 And I just didn't know that about the Lord.
 I think you see an example that in Moses's life.
 Okay.
 So early on in Moses's life, you see him killing an Egyptian because they're abusing
 an Israelite.
 Yeah.
 And right there, you see the longing and the desire of his heart accomplished through his will, not God's will.
 Yeah.
 But it was an inkling of what God had put in his heart to do, which was to redeem people.
 Yeah.
 OK, so that's partnership.
 What about number two?
 Obedience.
 I think obedience is the easiest one to understand, but maybe the best piece of advice advice, the best word concerning obedience I think I've ever heard is we were my sister's church in in Raleigh.
 No, in Charlotte, North Carolina, Elevation Church. The pastor who was speaking there,
 he said this line, he said, "Delayed obedience is the same as disobedience." And I think you can
 partner with the Lord all day long, but until you actually do what he's asking you, I don't think
 you'll ever see the change that you're longing for and that he's designed to bring.
 And I think about all of our dreaming and longing comes to a point of decision-making.
 Think about our adoption right now. That took an awful lot of work.
 And it wasn't exciting or pleasurable or enjoyable or easy. It was filled with friction
 and lots of paperwork. But now literally everything we can do for adoption is done.
 Now we wait.
 Same with getting married. Same with moving. My gosh, moving. Moving countries.
 That was crazy.
 We are remember that not only did we have to pack everything in our house we have to itemize what was in every single box every box number of the list on the outside like down to how many forks you had and things like that it was crazy yeah like sometimes obedience is.
 You know if excellence is the sum of a thousand tiny details obedience is often the same it's like can i just is my yes enough not the big yes is it's those and the little yes is.
 And there's often way more of those.
 I remember the day that we went for our interview for our citizenship for, no, for our green card or permanent residence.
 We had to drive through to, where was it?
 Memphis.
 Memphis.
 And I, you know, they send you a sheet of paper saying you need to bring this and this.
 So I've got what, three ring binders full of all our previous taxes, paperwork, all this stuff.
 I'm in a suit, shirt and tie. You're there. We're ready for our interview.
 I also was wearing clothes.
 Yes.
 So you're a shirt and die.
 You're there.
 I thought it was noteworthy because I was getting
 everyone's ever seen a shirt or die.
 But yes, AJ was fully happy.
 Was there also fully clothes?
 Keep going.
 But it just reminded me like this is the culmination
 of so much work because these three ring binders
 are like color coded and tabs.
 You know, if they ask you anything, I can find it in our index.
 I'm just thinking, man, this is so much work to accomplish the goal of the dream of my
 eight-year-old whore of becoming an American.
 Sometimes obedience is not sexy at all.
 It's just roll up your sleeves and get to it.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, but obedience is the easiest part, I think.
 So what was number three then?
 Number three is this whole thing about a willing spirit.
 Okay.
 Like I think the Lord will take obedience, like grumbling obedience, just a final do it.
 But I think that the cost difference between really expensive move and a really easy gracious move is how willing your spirit is to partner with him.
 Okay.
 Like I think about the friction that Jonah went through.
 Right? So initially he didn't want to obey and they get swallowed by great fish and that kind of been fun.
 But then even when he does obey and he's willing and he goes, he's not happy about the word that the Lord gives.
 You know, he just wishes that he would die.
 Like he doesn't, you know, even though he's obedient, the cost to him is huge because his heart attitude is wrong.
 He was obedient, but he had a lot of winching intercession and his obedience.
 I think about my own life when I have done things reluctantly, how much more expensive it's been for me.
 I think I told this on the podcast couple of, I don't know, we've done 200 and something episodes,
 But I remember when the Lord asked me to be a teacher, the best I could tell and I wasn't confident that the Lord had asked me to do
 this. But the best I could tell is that as far as I knew, I used to quit my job and go back to teacher training school, right?
 Do my postgraduate and teaching. Here's the thing. I don't want to be a teacher.
 So I certainly didn't want to go do the teacher training. By the way, at my cost, like my God bless my parents had already paid for my undergraduate
 degree. And so if I want to go do this, I had to pay my pay my way.
 So I quit my job and I go back to being a student, having just graduated after being a student for five years.
 That wasn't fun.
 And so I didn't want to do it.
 And I remember the first week I was sick to my stomach.
 And I think the sickness in my stomach was my indecision.
 Is this God? Is it not God? Am I wasting my money?
 You know, I could bail.
 It doesn't matter.
 You know, he just, you know, it's fine.
 even if I'm wrong, he'll figure, you know,
 la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
 you know, and I got myself sick
 because I wasn't willing to obey.
 I mean, practically it enrolled, but wasn't that enough?
 Isn't it just enough that I suggest
 or really have to graduate?
 I went through it again once I graduated it.
 Like, fine, fine.
 You said I want you to become a teacher.
 Technically, I am a teacher.
  </li><li>I am a teacher. - I have become a teacher.
 Do I really have to go and do the thing?
 You know, it was like, you know, like being dragged,
 it wasn't willing, it wasn't willing at all.
 And I paid the price for it.
 Lord still got what he wanted, but anyway, I remember going home to Dundee to stay my parents.
 I was remember sick. I remember getting up really, really early. I walked up to my parents' house
 was near a big graveyard, which sounds horrible. It was really beautiful. It was on a big table.
 It was really beautiful. And I'd go in and watch the sunrise over the river Tae,
 and I was reading the book of Revelation, and it was all to him who overcomes.
 Yep. Just sat there watching the sun come up in a graveyard.
 Kind of how my life felt at the time.
 Reading the book of Revelation to him overcomes like of a new name.
 To him overcomes, you know, I'll do this, I'll do that.
 And I just thought, okay, overcoming requires,
 I'm not only going to make the decision, I'm going to stick with the decision,
 I'm going to do it. And a lot of stuff shifted from me.
 I remember the same thing.
 I was in turmoil deciding whether to marry you or not.
 Yes.
 That's a little different.
 Because the Lord wasn't telling me you need to marry him.
 You must.
 No, it was disobedient.
 But, you know, I had this invitation, but I was sick in the, you know, as James says,
 you know, I was a double-minded man on stable in all my ways.
 But I also think like to my chagrin, I'm not very good at following the Lord when he's leading
 me into things that weren't my idea.
 So for example, it's kind of embarrassing to admit, but I think I've shared it before.
 number of years ago, we get the opportunity to go to Israel as a family.
 Yeah.
 All expenses paid.
 Someone comes to us and says, it's like to pay for your whole family to go to Israel.
 And that's like, and thanks.
 Like I had no interest in going to Israel.
 I was like, what?
 I was like, babe, no, you go.
 You know, I don't know, but this is an amazing opportunity.
 I was like, I don't like history.
 And it's a long flight.
 And I don't really want to take my kids.
 And like, literally, it's not lighting me up at all.
 And at the back of my head, I'm kind of like, this is kind of ignorant.
 someone's offering to pay for all expenses paid trip to Israel.
 You really don't want to go.
 And I remember talking to the Lord about it and the Lord did not
 lay any guilt trip me on me at all.
 But I remember thinking, OK, if this is the apple of his eye, right?
 If the Lord loves Jerusalem, if the Lord loves Israel, which he does, which he does.
 I mean, maybe we should go maybe seeing something that I'm not seeing.
 Yeah.
 And I remember just saying, Lord, I know I sound like an ingrate.
 And I just realized like I can't I can't give my yes to go above my heart,
 be a no the whole time because it'll be miserable for me miserable for you,
 miserable for the kid.
 So if I'm going to be in, I'm going to be all in.
 And I honestly really didn't want to go, but kind of just decided to talk
 myself into it and find out go.
 And then of course loved it and would love to go back.
 Yes.
 But I've tried to hold on to the whole thing, which I should already know, I say 55.
 My thoughts are not your thoughts.
 My ways are not your ways.
 So often if you're trusting a Lord to lead you in your life, you've got to understand
 that he knows better about your life than I do.
 Like for example, going back to the Lord saying, I want you to be a teacher.
 I couldn't imagine anything I want to do less than be a teacher.
 And now, as you all know, I love being a teacher.
 I love teaching.
 I love all of it.
 So I think the, I've just got struck with a little bit of fear of the Lord.
 Oh, and here's what my fear is.
 I'm waxing lyrical.
 All right.
 Cause I'm not really in a season of transition.
 Like, Hey, everybody, here's some great advice that I'm so glad I don't have to follow
 right now.
 And I'm just anticipating like in a month or so, the Lord's like, and remember that
 podcast you released about having a willy guard.
 So, but I think this is battle tested.
 Like we have lived through this.
 I would say this is true.
 And yeah, sometimes the heart is a slow learner.
 Yeah, for sure.
 Thoughts, tell me story about a willing heart.
 I mean, I would say what I like about the way
 that you phrase the one, two, three is I can recognize
 that my heart moves through those things.
 Usually the Lord gives me some sort of a heads up,
 you know, hey, whether it's a, you know,
 through a dream or whatever, some sort of--
 But I feel like you catch on way faster than I do.
 Well, I'm good like that.
 No, no, but I'm serious.
 I think the things that the Lord asked you to dream about,
 you very quickly, almost like a magnet,
 whoop, and connect with him about that.
 And you're like in.
 And I'm like, just give me like 12 to 24 months
 to ponder it, chew it faster.
  </li><li>I need to like really think about that.
 Look at statistics.
  </li><li>Do you think that's right?
 You are really quick.
  </li><li>I do think that's right.
 Yes.
 But I still see, like whether you're quick
 or whether you're slow, I still see those three things.
 like the hey, the Lord's saying, hey, what about this?
 Then the obedience part, okay, I'm gonna choose this.
 And then often they're like,
 if it, I mean, sometimes there's a delay, isn't there,
 before you're actually in the third?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>You know, where really it's partnership again,
 but a different kind of partner.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's a willingness.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 But I would say like, I can see that process
 in all of our big, all of our big moves,
 everything the Lord's asked of us,
 there's been those sort of three seasons
 for lack of a better.
  </li><li>Yes, the precipitate or around the time of a season change.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I was thinking about Paul Cain,
 he had this great phrase where he would say,
 "Sometimes a Lord will give you a foretaste of something,
 so you get a taste for something."
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>What I mean by that is oftentimes something will show up
 to wet your appetite, maybe awaken a longing
 that speaks to the very thing that God wants to do
 the next season. A little example that would be the very house that we're in now is in
 the neighborhood that we once upon a time before we even considered really moving to
 Nashville, we were like, wouldn't it be great to live here if we did? And now we do. Another
 example for me would be teaching. Like the Lord had me learn the craft of teaching in
 a Scottish school system before he ever released me to teach kingdom truths in a kingdom world.
 And I was talking to, we have an amazing, we have big surprise, we have amazing musicians
 at Grace Center.
 I was talking to Fred today, he's one of our keyboard players, amazing, amazing musicians.
 And we were chatting in between services about like, you know, how did you get started and
 you know what to use and where do you learn to play and all that sort of stuff.
 So he was just asking me like, hey, you know, you seem really passionate about this.
 I was telling my own journey with playing the piano and probably haven't played the piano
 10 years, but something I love to do.
 And he said, isn't it funny that you grew up as a child with a father who played a piano
 every single day, which my dad would do, and my dad would play by year.
 And you didn't notice that your parents tried to pay for piano lessons that you didn't want to do.
 And now here you are as an adult, and I was telling him I used to when I had a piano,
 I'd play the piano every day.
 and he said, "And here you are as an adult with this kind of latent desire now bringing the self back."
 Yeah.
 And I would encourage you, think about, I've got some questions for you to think about.
 Of course you do.
 Think about the things that seem to be being stirred up in this season that are reminiscent
 of a past season because it's most likely God doing something in those areas. It's that
 fore taste for a taste for.
 Yeah, that's great.
 Do you want some questions?
 I want some questions.
 Oh, well, I don't actually know if I want some questions.
 Yeah, you do. I wrote them down.
 Sure, okay.
 I want you to think about this because it's most like the Lord to be intentional.
 The other thing you've heard of, sis so many times before,
 the only thing that's been on the other side of obedience for us
 is other satisfaction.
 Really is just delight.
 No matter the sacrifice, no matter how much it's cost,
 right, you can never go wrong obeying.
 Well, it's only ever led to satisfaction.
 Okay, here's three questions for our listeners.
 Okay.
 I'll put these questions.
 Oh, I thought they were for me.
 Okay.
 Well, they're for you.
 They're for every to kind of take to the Lord, ponder journal.
 Good.
 Talk about ready.
 Number one.
 Yeah.
 What is your heart longing for in the season?
 And my encouragement is don't discount those things that are outside of your
 possibilities, because those are the very things that the Lord specializes in.
 You okay?
 Did you see the future?
 I just nodded my head and my neck cracked.
 That was so loud.
 Sorry.
 Okay.
 Orthopedic care is the thing you were longing for.
 It's like, I got it.
 I'm going to ask about that.
 But I nodded.
 It just cracked really loud.
 I was like, wow.
 Was that as 50s.
 I just buy things.
 Pay attention to what's longing.
 Yeah.
 And sometimes we don't know what's longing, which is why we're in seasons of
 discontentment so that long arises.
 second question, we're just talking about this. What is coming up in this past season
 that feels like an old thing being revisited? Let me talk about piano play. But what's coming
 up for you that it's like, this again could be the Lord is stirring the waters. And then
 my final question is really a reframing of what's going on in your life right now. In
 In what ways are your circumstances conspiring against you, could it actually be the Lord
 moving out of an old season into something new?
 Have you ever been in that season of life where it feels like everything is working against
 you?
 You're feeling pressed, pressed, squished, squeezed, doors are closing and we sometimes write a
 story that, you know, my circumstances are against me.
 if it's actually the Lord in his kindness moving you into something new, I have a ponder about
 that. Yeah, you want to really seek the Lord about that because it also might just be that
 there's something that needs to die and he's not actually moving you into something new.
 So you don't want to just sort of go, I feel uncomfortable. You know what it must mean? Because
 That's like the easy way out too.
 So that's my only question for you.
 But here's what I've learned.
 Working hard.
 I don't think I want to work anymore.
 Yeah, that's not really what we mean.
 But here's what I've learned.
 Yeah.
 Even if you get wrong, if that if that's what you're trying to do,
 yeah, like trying to excuse hard season.
 Yes.
 Then like, you know, hard seasons are not respect
 for your geography.
 If you moved to a new job or a new, it'll just fall.
 That's why you want to know before you're like, you know, it's so much better if I move over there.
 Granted.
 Granted.
 All right.
 Well, there you go.
 That's our thoughts on transition.
 I don't know where you are.
 I hope that's blessed you if you're in a season of transition.
 If you're not, bookmark this episode to come back when you will be.
 Because I think for all of us, there's something happening right now in the spirit
 where seasons of transition, if it's not obedience, it's partnership.
 And if it's not partnership or obedience, then it could be like the willingness of your
 heart. Like what are you engaging with? Okay. I had a
 listeners question that's been asked repeatedly in the last
 couple of weeks. Oh, dear. Okay. No, it's a great question.
 Yeah. Several people have written in this one from an
 anonymous person. Rebecca, you also answered this question,
 just want to let you know we heard you. She says this, this is
 anonymous. My husband and I are completely blown away by the
 lessons you've been teaching on tithing and giving. It's all
 totally new information, even though we both grew up in the
 church. It's not funny. Wow. Stuff that we're familiar with can become become new again. Thank
 you, Jesus. My question is this, where do we tithe in the midst of finding a church? Like other
 people have written and gone, Hey, I just moved to a new city. I haven't found a church yet. What
 do I do with my tithe in the meantime? Okay. Well, what do you say? Well, I would say wherever you're
 getting fed. So, so if you're like watching a church online or you know, whatever, yeah, wherever
 you're getting fed until you find a new church to get plugged into and then
 tied there. Yes, and I think it's a very important distinction to me because one of
 the things I've noticed just in my walking with people is that they will go
 "I'm not being fed in my own church so I'll keep tithing to somewhere else." No,
 no, bring the food into the storehouse. You don't have a storehouse do what
 he says to give wherever you're being fed or tithe rather. But try and find a
 home congregation. And as soon as you do put down roots financially so that you'll
 be blessed with that. Yeah. All right. Straight forward. Thanks for asking the question. Everybody
 who sent them in. Hey Jones, have you figured out when the financial thing is going to be yet?
 I don't mean to put you on the spot. Okay. I just thought, did I miss it? No one knows the time.
 Oh, the Lord knows when it will start. Yeah. Very soon. Soon and very soon. Okay. Soon and very soon.
 Got you. Sometimes in the next thousand years, definitely in the next thousand years.
 It'll start.
 And if the Lord carries, it will start.
 Yes.
 Should he, Terry?
 Yes.
 Great.
