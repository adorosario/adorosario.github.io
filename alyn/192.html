<p> I live in a days but got for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to episode one ninety two of keeping up with the jones is where this week we're going to talk about a heart of stone,
 but first it's good to see you miss is Jones thank you I've missed sitting opposite you.
 It's been a while it's been a while I know and as a result we have a big catch up to do we do we don't have an episode last week.
 No, because we weren't here to record it.
 That's correct.<br/>
 We went to Florida, sunny Florida, with all of the staff from the school of supernatural life,
 to say thank you to them for all their hard work last year.
 Yes, it was so fun.<br/>
 It was five days of glorious rest.<br/>
 Rest.<br/>
 Well, two of those days was driving.<br/>
 Well, yes, but I mean, we got there around four or five in the afternoon on Friday.
 Plenty of time to go swimming with dolphins.
 if there was dolphins dolphins in my mind great okay yeah and then we had three days of just being
 there being at the beach hanging out together having fun eating food i brought my drone things
 you did i got lots of beautiful drone photography beautiful footage or drone videography something
 like that um we came class passed the fact that all of our students actually graduated we did
 with graduation.<br/>
 This is what happens when you have a podcast in a couple of weeks.
 Nearly 100 students between year one and year two.
 Congratulations guys, we love you.<br/>
 We love you so much.<br/>
 I miss you already.<br/>
 I realized on Thursday, this past Thursday, I was like, I just missed them.
 And you know, every class I think I fall in love with, and it takes me a while to adjust.
 So I'm adjusting.<br/>
 In other news, we went to see the new Avengers movie.
 We did.<br/>
 Which we refuse to discuss for at least a month.
 Yes.<br/>
 who wants to see is it the opportunity to see it and then we will discuss.
 Yes, I guess we can as long as we say, "Hey, we're discussing this movie in case they haven't seen it yet."
 Right, well you have a month people.<br/>
 You have a month.<br/>
 And then we started a diet where you eat lots of fat but you don't get fat. How does that work?
 Well, I don't fully understand it yet but we're four or five days in.
 You sure it's not witchcraft?<br/>
 I'm pretty sure it's called the ketogenic diet and essentially you are trying to eat
 70 to 80% fat, 20 to 30% protein and 5 to 10% carbs. So basically you get to eat steak and
 chicken and lamb and all that kind of stuff smothered in butter, but it's got to be like
 like grass fed organic, you know, good fats or whatever.
 And then you can have like green leafy vegetables, you know, kale and what are other ones, broccoli,
 you know that kind of stuff.<br/>
 I don't know.<br/>
 I've been out four days and I've neither eaten broccoli or kale, but I haven't eaten lots
 of butter.<br/>
 Butter.<br/>
 Mm.<br/>
 We're also doing the bulletproof coffee in the morning.
 Yeah.<br/>
 So this is where you take coffee.<br/>
 You add grass fed butter to it and some sort of oil and then blend it.
 And I remember lots of people have said to me over the years, "Oh, it's so good.
 You'll love it."<br/>
 No.<br/>
 You don't love it.<br/>
 I don't understand.<br/>
 Because I'm making their Bulletproof Hot Chocolate, and I think it's delicious, and we should
 add it adds intermittent fasting.<br/>
 So the last thing you eat is about 6 p.m.
 And then we don't eat again until like 1 p.m. the following day.
 Yes.<br/>
 But you have a cup of Bulletproof Coffee, or in my case, Bulletproof Hot Chocolate first
 in the morning, and it keeps you feeling full all day.
 It does keep you feeling full.<br/>
 It's just not nice tasting coffee.<br/>
 I don't understand how that is.<br/>
 Is it just that your coffee sucks?<br/>
 Because adding the butter and this oil,
 all it does is make it frothy and creamy.
 An oily.<br/>
 I can't taste the oil in it at all.<br/>
 I can taste the oil.<br/>
 Not tasty, but it's the filmy aftertaste.
 Oh, I'm a sucker for it.<br/>
 Yuck.<br/>
 And then the Grey Center this morning,
 Jeff Dollar, our fearless leader,<br/>
 began to roll out some exciting things.
 If you like Grey Center,<br/>
 if you know what Grey Center is,<br/>
 the church that we attend. And if you're somebody who is interested in what's happening at Grace
 and everything, I would really encourage you to watch this week's service to see what Jeff is
 talking about, see if it strikes a passion in your heart. It actually kicks off, I think, four weeks
 of messages, which coincide with our source conference. So if you're coming for the source
 conference, you may wish to watch this as like an added extra as well.
 Yeah, it should be very good. Also, there was the grand opening of Mojo's taco shop this
 week. So good. It's in the factory. If you haven't been, we highly recommend it. It's
 really, really good.<br/>
 Yeah, it's absolutely delicious. We've been feasting from the taco truck. And now they've
 got an actual store, which we're very excited about.
 Yeah. Well, our topic this week comes actually from a listeners question. This listener wants
 to stay anonymous. So I was about to say your name, but I haven't. They write in and they
 They said, "Hello, I have listened to Yall's podcast for a while now and have also been
 listening to Grace Enner's sermons on Sunday and I absolutely love both.
 I was recently listening to the Grace Enner podcast with the Esso Self-student testimonies
 from outreach and I heard a lot about the heart of stone teaching.
 I've read the verse in the Bible about how God will turn your heart of stone into a
 heart of flesh, but I haven't heard any teaching about it.
 Could Yall elaborate on what it is about and maybe point me in the right direction to learn
 a little bit more.<br/>
 Thanks.<br/>
 Well, I'm so glad that you asked Anonymous
 because that's exactly what we're gonna talk about tonight,
 which is the heart of stone.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah.
 So the heart of stone sort of simply put
 is a defense mechanism.
  </li><li>Ooh, is that a good thing or a bad thing?
  </li><li>Well, it's not a good thing,
 but it feels like a necessary thing often when we do it.
 So it's, usually it will trace back to a memory
 or a set of specific memories
 where we actually shut down our hearts because of the amount of pain that we're feeling.
 And we just sort of shut down all emotion in order to survive whatever the event is at the time.
 And what we end up doing is creating something called a heart of stone,
 which is just a deadening of emotions really. Yes. And it becomes somewhat like if you have a
 picture of you building up a stone wall around you so that pain can get through that's kind of
 of what happens. It's this defense mechanism that you build where you just harden your heart
 so you don't feel pain anymore. It's really effective at keeping pain out.
 Yes, it is effective, but at some point that pain will resurface.
 Yeah, pain has a habit of doing that.
 Yeah. It's usually a temporary fix that helps you get out of a certain situation,
 but if we don't actually realize we're doing it, we don't realize, "Oh my gosh, I'm shutting down
 my heart right now. I'm actually not even allowing the Lord to minister to me. I'm not getting help
 with this. Then you can end up years down the road. And all of a sudden things are exploding
 around you as bombs go off in your heart. And you have no idea that this actually dates back to
 years before when to survive an event, we shut down our hearts.
 The other funny thing is, I mean, this is not funny, but the other interesting thing about
 about heart stone is while it is effective at keeping pain out, it's also keeping inadvertently
 the love of God out. Yes.
 Because the same area where your heart is alive and can feel how ease and pain is the
 same area where your heart can feel loved and cared for. So people with hearts of stone,
 it depends on the culture you come from, but people with hearts of stone are often really
 applauded because they can just power through. They're not swayed by all these feelings.
 They can just get things done. They may be even annoyed at other people having feelings.
 They tend to have a very low need for need. They make great pastors because they can just
 shut down and power through. Now, I say all that with a bit of a tongue in cheek, but
 I remember being in revival meetings where everybody else is getting touched by the Lord.
 And I'm like, what's wrong with me?
 Why can't I feel the presence of God?
 And it's like, oh, you've spent years perfecting, hardening your heart.
 And that's why you can't feel the love of God.
 And here you are with your thing that you tried to perfect.
 So how do you know if you've got a horse, Don?
 Well, there's actually a heart of stone checklist.
 It's funny you should say that because I've just pulled it up on my laptop.
 You did?
 Well, it's just the cheeriest list ever.
 I think we should read it.
 It's like one of those things of, um, you may have a heartstone.
 If right.
 I remember the first time I heard the checklist.
 Why I remember the first time I heard the, uh, the teaching.
 And I was like, Oh, those poor people with hearts of stone, you know, never,
 never assuming it would be me.
 Right.
 Until we read the checklist.
 And I was like, Oh no, well, I'm the poor people.
 When I read the checklist, I was like, no, isn't this like a really mature
 person. This can't be somebody that has a heart of stone. This sounds like a good type of person.
 Yes, we want that. We want that person.
 So people with a heart of stone often keep people at a distance, protect themselves,
 keep up a good front, but have trouble being real, are unable to show their emotions,
 are used to keeping it all together, have the role of the strong one. Keeping it all together
 is otherwise known as performing or stiff upper lip for all our British listeners.
 Yes, lovely.
 Find it difficult to ask for help.
 Now, isn't that just the trait of every man?
 Whoa, judgment.
 Oh, I just realized, you said help and I meant directions.
 You know how they say men don't ask for directions.
 The reason we don't need to ask for directions is we're the ones using our GPS.
 You're the one that refuses to use Siri.
 I digress.
 People with a heart of stone often can minister to others, but can't be
 ministered to. How about this one? Wish other people could keep it all together
 like they do? Yes, I have had several events in my life where I have been to
 movies. Tell the one about Titanic. So I went to go and see Titanic with our
 youth group. So this is, I mean, how long ago did Titanic come out? I don't even know
 long time ago. At one point in the movie, I looked down, there's like 18 people in our
 row and everybody's crying. I yelled down the row and it was a full theater. "Get it together,
 would you? It's a movie!" I think you actually said, "Oh, suck it up. It's a movie." I did.
 I said I was stuck up.
 Lastly, people with a heart stone find it difficult to receive love. They look down on those who
 express emotions as being weak or immature and then have difficulty with intimacy but may not
 realize it. Often because intimacy isn't something that's desired or isn't aware of need if you've
 spent years shucking down your heart. Yeah. Well, because intimacy would be something that would
 would then crack open that pain so you can't long for intimacy and keep a heart of stone.
 Right. Would you like a couple of testimonies?
 Sure.
 So I remember that there was a new boy in our school when I was in primary school,
 which is elementary school for North American listeners. There was a new boy that joined our
 school. His name was Scott McGookin. There's a good Scottish name for you.
 Scott McGookin. Can you say that with a Scottish accent?
 It just did. Scott McGookin.
 Well, no, it sounds still kind of American.
 Oh, give it your best Scottish accent.
 No, because then I'll sound like you.
 What are you talking about?
 The Gukin.
 That's how you say it.
 That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid.
 Okay, I'll translate for all of the Scottish people that are listening.
 It may be the last time you listened, but I'll translate for you.
 Okay.
 So I remember a new boy.
 Right.
 Scott the Gukin joined the school and as was one to do, I've been taught that you must be Jesus to everyone.
 And I had this huge heart compassion in this poor boy. He doesn't know anybody.
 And if I was in his shoes, I'd want a friend. So I'll be his friend.
 We haven't talked about the victim triangle yet.
 Next week.
 But that was me being a rescuer.
 Yes.
 And so I was like, oh, I'll be his friend.
 And then that will make him happy.
 And I remember thinking, how many people is this?
 I remember thinking, if I tell him something super secret, then he'll feel like he's really
 trusted and our friendship bond will grow.
 I remember thinking that at a very early age.
 How old are you at this point?
 I don't know, like maybe like seven or eight.
 So the trouble is when you're seven or eight, you don't really have anything that requires
 tremendous trust.
 So I made up something.
 I told him a made-up secret.
 This gives you a huge insight into seven year old Alan.
 There's already lots of control and manipulation going on.
 But I'm thinking I'll tell him that I hate it when people call me big ears.
 Like that this is the secret.
 Now the thing is nobody ever called me big ears.
 You have sweet little ears.
 I know, but I just thought this would be really vulnerable of me.
 We're forming a bond.
 He's really trusted.
 This is like his first day of school.
 Yeah.
 So I tell him, Scott, I'm gonna tell you something I've never told Henry before.
 I hate it when people call me big ears.
 And rather than Scott going, man, I feel so bonded with this band of brothers.
 He used that information against me to leverage new friends.
 By telling everyone the class, Jonesy hates it when he called him big ears.
 So they all started calling me big ears.
 And I went home really upset.
 Not, not that people were calling me big ears, but that he used my magnificent
 friendship technique against me.
 So, so thanks for laughing at my core page.
 I appreciate it.
 I'm sorry.
 But basically what that wrote on my heart was it's not worth risking connection because
 you'll only be rejected.
 Right.
 So I'm just not going to open my heart anymore.
 Screw that guy.
 He's dead to me.
 Right.
 And so what happened, the fruit of that is over the years until I heard this
 teaching was I failed to make friendships with any depth because I thought you're
 just waiting to screw me over. I know how this works. You and Scott and McGookin are in it together.
 So that was my heart of stone. I'm just going to, you know, when I meet people, I'm just going to
 keep them at arms length. I'm good. This far, you may come and know more. And I certainly will not
 open my heart in vulnerability. So have you forgiven him or do you want me to lead you through prayer?
 I forgive. I forgive. Scott McGookin. No, this was one of the things I prayed through in Toronto,
 And I was like, oh my gosh, that's that's crazy.
 Do you have one?
  </li><li>Well, I have a thing where I didn't realize
 it was a heart of stone at the time,
 but I was, I've told this story on the podcast before,
 but it was after my first husband had left.
 It was after my first husband had left.
 And I mean, many years after he had left
 and actually right before I met you.
 So probably eight years after he'd left.
 And I was on this beach in Prince Edward Island,
 which was beautiful.
 And I was having a time with the Lord.
 And the Lord showed me this wall
 that I had built around my life.
 And he said, when you know, he said,
 when your first husband left,
 I mean, he called him by name,
 'cause he knew his name,
 but I'm not saying him the podcast, obviously.
 He said, when your first husband left,
 he said, "You built a wall."
 so hard and so fast because you just didn't think you could survive another loss.
 And he said, the problem is you've kept all of us out. And he showed me myself in the turret
 of a castle. -Wow. Surrounded by stones.
 -Surrounded by stones. But I didn't leave myself a door or a window or anything to get out.
 And I built it up and it was way, way above my head. There was no way of getting out of this thing.
 And so the Lord showed me that.
 And I, I knew it at that point.
 I was like, Oh, wow.
 I've, I've formed a heart of stone.
 So, um, you know, the Lord in his kindness, of course, also shows you the way out of those things.
 Right.
 He's so good.
 Yeah.
 Imagine if you hadn't repented of building that heart of stone and then I met you.
 Well, I literally met you for the first time a week later.
 I know, but that's what I'm saying.
 Imagine you hadn't.
 Yeah.
 I wouldn't have blinded to this glory.
 right, the body of a Greek god and you know all that. I mean, I would have, I would have
 missed it all.
 I'm glad you prayed through that. I remember being a little boy and I remember coming home
 from I guess preschool was probably nursery, nursery in Scotland preschool in North America.
 And we were doing the story of the emperor where's no clothes. Remember, is that actually
 what's called the emperor's new clothes?
 Was this just an excuse so that everybody runs around naked?
 I wasn't homeschooled in Canada.
 And so I had to draw something from this book, you know, where the emperor is naked,
 but he's so arrogant and vain that everyone's telling him he looks amazing in the suit.
 You know the story? You're familiar with that? Yes.
 Yeah. So I draw, I draw basically a picture of the king on his big parade,
 and I was very impressed because I draw him naked.
 I run home as little kids I want to do to show my mommy and daddy.
 And when I showed my dad the picture, he pointed to my correctly anatomically
 drawn king. It's not all you're thinking. And my dad pointed to the nipples that I had
 drawn, I'd drawn two little nipples on this king. And my dad, just in Jovial Jessett, well,
 what are those? But I misinterpreted what he was asking. I interpreted it as I'd done
 something wrong, felt tremendous shame. And I remember kind of leaving the room, my face
 flush and going to my room. And I remember coaching myself, you never show anybody your
 achievements again. Never let anybody see your achievements. And that was my heart of stone
 developing in that little thing where I'd learned a lesson, I'm closing down my heart,
 I no longer want to be seen for any achievements in case I'm rejected.
 Yeah.
 And that's really difficult because when you grow up and God has a heart to actually honor you and
 display you to the world for His glory, you're dying inside because you don't want anybody to
 see what you've done for fear of rejection. So that was another fun thing that has been
 dealt with over the years. So now I get to enjoy being me. I now get to enjoy being
 celebrated. Now I get to enjoy being loved, which I couldn't do before. It's just this
 barrier.
 Yeah. I think sometimes too, you'll have a heart of stone in a certain area. So you
 You might not be seeing evidence of a heart of stone in every area of your life.
 You might have some really healthy relationships.
 You might have something that is going really well, but then there's spots where you just
 hit this toughness.
 Right.
 It's that your heart is stony rather than completely turned to stone.
 In Matthew 22 verse 37, the very famous verse, Jesus says, "Love the Lord your God with all
 your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind."
 The second is like it, love your neighbors yourself.
 You've got a couple of problems there.
 If not all of your heart is online,
 you can't actually love the Lord your God with all of it.
 If the stony parts of it, if the area is where like,
 you know what, Lord, I'm just gonna manage this part of my heart.
 It's secure.
 I've got some barbed wire around this bad boy.
 I'm good.
 Lord, like, actually that's a part I wanna be able to love.
 And if that is a stony heart, you can't love yourself well,
 which means everybody around you suffers.
 And then there's the really famous verse
 that our anonymous listener was referring to,
 Ezekiel 36 verse 26 is this,
 it's a promise, I will give you a new heart
 and put a new spirit within you.
 I will remove from you your heart of stone
 and give you a heart of flesh.
 And so the promise is life in the Holy Spirit
 is a soft, tender, lush heart,
 this heart of flesh that can feel the love of God,
 that can feel the love of other people
 and is never designed to be hardened,
 But unfortunately, when we face pain or when we face crisis,
 because the heart is a slow learner,
 rather than bringing that pain to the Lord,
 is it Lord?
 I have an AOE that that's stung.
 We tend to harden our heart and keep people out,
 which is not the liquid going for the season.
  </li><li>And what's so wonderful about that verse is he says,
 "I will take your heart of stone
 "and I will give you art of flesh."
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So it's literally just being able to go, okay, Father,
 I recognize when, you know, Alan read that list
 or you may have heard this teaching before,
 I recognize that I have a heart of stone
 or I have stony parts of my heart
 where I am my sole protector of that area.
 And your promise is that you'll give me a heart of flesh.
 And so I'm giving you permission to begin that process.
 And, you know, sometimes it's in an instant
 and sometimes he wants to talk to you about some stuff
 and unravel some stuff that your heart has believed
 your heart is learned. But he promises to do it. So to me, that's like a huge encouragement
 because otherwise you hear a teaching like this, or you hear a discussion like this and
 you go, "Wow, like, oh, I have this thing and now there's no way out." It's not that
 there's no way out. There's absolutely a way out. It's asking the father to come in.
 Right. So what do you do? If you're recognizing, "Oh, I have some of the fruits of a stony
 What does somebody who's listening to this do to actually access the heart of flesh that
 the Lord's already given them?
 Well I think you start by just saying, "Okay Lord, I acknowledge that it's there."
 And start to have a conversation with God about why it's there.
 Lord, could you show me when this started forming?
 Because usually it's when you're fairly young.
 Right.
 Well not always.
 In both our examples we give when we're older.
 Yeah.
 And just start to have a discussion about, okay, Lord, like, you know, in the midst of that situation, who can you forgive?
 Where did you take control in IE decide you were going to protect your own heart and then and then reverse that decision, right?
 So Father recognize that I tried to take control in this moment and protect my heart because it was just so painful.
 But I'd actually like to give this to you and trust that you're going to bring healing that you will protect my heart.
 you know that you can work through this situation and it might be that he highlights several situations to you it might just be one.
 But you just invite the Holy Spirit into the process and have a discussion with him about what he wants to talk to you about that area.
 Yeah and usually it goes by identifying that you have a heartstone asking the Lord for revelation from where you got it.
 And it was usually a hurt. So you repent of making that choice to harden your heart.
 Typically you have to forgive the person that hurt you. And then usually it's just saying,
 okay, Lord, I'm going to choose to take down this stony area of my heart. And then the fun begins
 because you get to walk out in life and asking the Holy Spirit to teach you a new pattern,
 not where you retreat or pull away, but where you actually keep being vulnerable and staying
 connected in relationships, even if they get a little bit rocky.
 Yeah. I also think sometimes it's helpful and I don't think all the time, but sometimes
 I ask the Lord, can you show me what this robbed for me? Because I think sometimes we
 don't realize that the way that we chose to live life after a hurtful episode actually
 has created an entire scenario that didn't need to be there. And so if we can actually
 have the courage to say, Father, would you show me what this having a heart of son in
 this area has robbed from me, then you can actually do a little work with the Lord on
 that too.
 It's a great motivator.
 Yeah.
 It also says in the scriptures, if you catch a thief, he has to pay you sevenfold.
 Yeah.
 So there is something about seeing what was stolen from you and going, "Hey, I want that
 back."
 And that's another way to get abundance in your life.
 Yeah.
 So there you go.
 That's our brief introduction to a heart of stone.
 I hope that was helpful, anonymous question-asker.
 If you have any more questions about that, please feel free to ask us by going to alananagio.com/ask.
 Given that we're on a roll of answering questions, Rebecca wrote in and she asked us this.
 Well, first of all, I love this.
 She's an Alan A.J.
 You're my clean up dishes and car ride companion.
 So thank you.
 So funny because that's exactly when I listen to podcasts when I'm doing the dishes or when
 I'm in the car on my own because you don't like the podcasts I listen to.
 No, because you listen to people with nasley voices who you listen to it on like a speed
 that is not natural.
 It's not natural.
 Okay.
 Enough, enough with the Scottish accent.
 So Rebecca asked this question.
 She said three years ago, God gave me a picture of my husband, who was then a teacher doing
 something completely different, told me it would be three years.
 And I started hearing and seeing the word Nashville everywhere.
 I kept that quiet and stewarded it until the Lord eventually released me to tell my husband
 about it.
 This year, my husband had no peace about renewing his teaching contract and we find ourselves
 on a new adventure as he moves on to something new.
 The funny thing, we're at three years.
 These last few months, the Lord has spoken to him about the same things that God spoke
 to me about three years ago.
 My question is this, why does God seem to communicate things to me first?
 I've heard it said, "It's so the woman can keep peace in the home for the children,
 but I'm not sure about this."
 That's not it.
 Can you give insight into God's timing of telling one partner first?
 Thanks for your weekly encouragement.
 I love listening to the banter, wisdom and teaching you guys share, keep it up.
 So we have a very similar dynamic in our marriage that more often than God tends to tell you
 things before He tends to tell me that there have been rare occasions when that's been
 the opposite.
 But the question still stands.
 Why is it that God tells one partner of the relationship before another?
 Gosh, I don't even know if I know that.
 I would say maybe it depends on whose heart would be most open to hearing it at that time.
 Right.
 So I would say in most of the ones where I've heard first, I'm probably also asking first,
 where you in those seasons were more sort of bogged down isn't the right word,
 but focused on what needed to happen today. Does that make sense?
 Yeah, and I think also sometimes you've needed more time to process so you get a head start on it.
 Oh, I need way more time to process. If God says go, you'll just be like, "Go, yeah!"
 And I'm like, "Wait, what?" You know, so...
 So he's kind to your kind of play and gives you a couple of years head start to process
 That's it.
 And adjust your heart.
 But sometimes it's the reverse.
 Like God had told you about moving house
 way before he told me.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I think part of that was
 so you could pray and just intercede.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And but what I loved is you never put pressure on me.
 You never told me,
 I've been thinking about this forever.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>So that when the Lord, but if you think about it,
 I mean the Lord just told me one night as I was going to bed.
 I mean, to this day I assume it was the Lord.
 It was like, now is a good time to sell your house.
 Imagine if you hadn't had that warning.
 And as I wake up in the morning, "Hey, last night as I went to bed, I think the Lord told me we shouldn't sell our house.
 So I'm going to put it in the market."
 So in his kindness, he tells you in advance.
 Yes.
 I think sometimes it's about confirmation too.
 So Rebecca, imagine the Lord hadn't told you that.
 And one day your husband comes home and just says, "Ah, I think I'm going to just ditch this whole teaching thing.
 You know the whole thing I went to school for and is my professional trade."
 And this seems a bit random, but I think I'm moving to Nashville.
 Like it's nice that you got a heads up on that so that you could prepare your heart
 for that moving.
 I don't know if there's a.
 So there's probably like hundreds of different reasons why God would do that.
 But you can't just say that women are awesome and that's why.
 Well, the thing is women are awesome.
 But I'm not sure that's not always the women that here first.
 I was just being funny.
 No, but women are also not.
 So that's the point that needs to be reinforced.
 Well, I think what I love about our relationship is we are both leading
 are marriage together, both leading our family. Sometimes you get the revelation,
 sometimes I get the revelation, but whatever we do, we don't move until both of us have peace
 about it. So I guess what we're saying, Rebecca, is we don't really know, but we love your story
 because we can relate to it hugely. And it sounds like you were really wise that you
 didn't. I've seen horrible manipulation in marriages where people are like, but I heard the Lord say,
 and I'm like, yeah, you may well have, but let every matter be established by two or three witnesses.
 Yeah, so just write it down date it write it down in your journal and then leave it alone good
 Yeah, all right anything in our closing thoughts a G. Jones. Well, I did have the thought of
 I'm not sure if we have mentioned in the last couple weeks that the school
 Applications to the school would be closing on June 15th
 The phone we have not said that yeah
 So if you are praying about or thinking about joining us for the School of Supernatural Life,
 either year one or coming back and doing year two with us,
 your applications need to be complete, including all of your references and everything by June 15th.
 And every year we get people who are like, "Oh, I missed the deadline. Please don't be one of those people."
 Yeah, because then you have to wait till next year.
 Right. So June 15th is your deadline. It's fast approaching. If you're thinking about doing it,
 now is a great time to pray, ask the Lord for some confirmations and take a step out and start
 the application process. We also have our source conference coming up in a couple of weeks.
 It's going to be at Grace and it's all about how to steward the presence of God in your everyday life,
 whether you're a mom or a dad, or whether you're a business person, whether you're a leader,
 Or just you're wondering how how does the presence of God follow me from Sunday into my normal everyday life in terms of organization or health.
 This is the conference for you were super excited about all of the speakers at the conference are members of grace and other experts in their field.
 And it's going to be very short workshop style with plenty of opportunity to ask questions we'd love you to come join us and if you do if you're an out of town guest please come up and say hi to a jn I would love it when we get to meet people.
 and it's so fun. Yeah, it's great. So please don't be shy. Come up. We're very friendly. Usually.
 We like to think we are. We hope we are. It depends on our last eight.
 But that's probably true. But you can find more information about that at grace center dot us
 slash source. And as always, we'll put everything we've talked about this week in the show notes.
 Hey, I just thought of something great. If you're coming up to meet us for the first time and
 and you're not sure if we're hungry, just come bringing a snack.
 But make sure it's a ketogenic snack.
 Okay.
 So high and fat, moderate protein, really low corporate grades.
 Never mind.
 Just come and say hi.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Thank you so much for listening.
 It's great to be back.
 We'll be back same time, same place next week.
