<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll live in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Hey everybody, welcome back.
 We're so glad that you're here.
  </li><li>Hey, did Jones?
  </li><li>Yes sir.
  </li><li>How was your week?
  </li><li>It was good, lots of meetings and Zoom calls.
  </li><li>Did we do anything fun?
 Nobody wants to hear about Zoom calls.
  </li><li>No, did we do anything fun?
 We're building our island on Animal Crossing.
 Animal Crossing, sorry about that.
 Oh wait, although I'm not because I saw this great tweet yesterday.
 So Animal Crossing is a game where it's basically
 Playhouse for grownups.
 And so the idea--
 Yes, it's totally Playhouse for grownups.
 Basically, you have an island that's your own
 that you cultivate and you build houses on.
 And you plant bushes and put up fences and decorate rooms.
 Catch butterflies.
 Catch butterflies.
 Yeah, catch and sell.
 And complete distraction from reality.
 However, yesterday I saw somebody
 tweet using the hashtag Animal Crossing thing.
 Yeah.
 And in the game, you can buy and sell things.
 And one of the things you want to buy and sell is turnips.
 And so everybody wants to know what and the price changes
 on everybody's eye on.
 I promise the story is going somewhere.
 We hope.
 You're like, what do I tune into?
 I thought this was going to be on feelings.
 Yeah.
 And somebody tweeted out, oh, like my turnip price is whatever
 the price was.
 And Elijah Wood, the actor, reached out to the person who
 said, can I come to your island?
 I've got a lot of turnips to sell.
 So this person was like, sure.
 So Elijah would came to her island and they hung out for like half an hour an hour.
 And I was like, oh, I love it.
 So funny.
 Yeah, it's, it's fine.
 Actually, Abigail has her own island now.
 And so I go to her island and bring her stuff that she needs.
 And she brings us stuff that, you know, well, she doesn't have that much at the moment.
 But I saw a Twitter post by somebody who was like, yeah, they're doing math.
 Animal crossing, you know, like they're selling things.
 and buying things and whatever.
 And then they were like, yeah, they're learning stuff
 and doing science.
 All you have to do is read about all the little plants
 and things that they pick up.
 So it's like, oh, okay, then my kids are doing great.
  </li><li>We're not playing Nintendo, we're homeschooling.
  </li><li>Yeah, we're homeschooling via Animal Crossing.
  </li><li>Yeah, well that's our Animal Crossing update.
 I'm sure that's the part that you tuned in for.
  </li><li>That is definitely what you wanted to hear.
  </li><li>We've been talking about feelings.
  </li><li>We have.
  </li><li>And we want to give a very big thank you
 to everybody who's been tuning in.
 Thank you to those of you who've watched,
 who've been listening, who've sent in encouraging messages.
 There's one group of people,
 Adrian, I want to do an extended thank you to though.
 And that is our patrons.
 They are beautiful people just like you,
 who support the show financially.
 So they give about a dollar, well, from as little as a dollar,
 up to whatever they want to give per episode.
 And traditionally, one of the perks of being a patron
 is that we released the video.
 They get video access to it.
 And so really, they've been helping us get video working.
 Yes, because video is really hard and expensive.
 Yeah. And so they've been super super helpful.
 So I want to just say a very big thank you on behalf of aging.
 I to all our patron supporters.
 They have really made the video available to everybody in this season.
 We made a decision when we started podcasting again, especially in this COVID season.
 Excuse me.
 Somebody's watch is not on silent.
 I forgot to mute my watch.
 I say that with judgment, but I'll need to check mine now.
 We really want to extend a big thank you to our patrons.
 When we started podcasting again,
 it was at the start of the COVID, what do you call it?
  </li><li>19.
  </li><li>The stay at home thing.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And really we wanted to be with people
 and videos such a compelling medium.
 And we just made the patron privilege
 of having videos available to everyone.
 So thank you to our patrons for helping us
 get up and run with video.
  </li><li>Yes, thank you very, very much.
  </li><li>Thank you to everybody watching.
 If you would like to become a patron, super simple.
 just go to allen and AJ.com/patron
 and you can support the show from as little
 as a dollar an episode
 and you'll have access to all the videos as well
 when we eventually return back to post COVID normality.
  </li><li>Yes, but they'll also have access to outtakes
 and stuff that the normal people will have.
  </li><li>The normal people, whatever that means.
 I don't know who the normal people are.
  </li><li>Let's talk about normality.
  </li><li>If you find the normal people,
 please let us know, we'd like to meet them.
 We've been talking about eight feelings.
 It's the work of Dr. Chip Dodd.
 He's written a brilliant book called The Voice of the Heart.
 We've been encouraging everybody to read it
 as we're doing the podcast.
 We learned about it through Chip's organization
 called Sage Hill.
 We've done some of their training.
 We've just found them to be an incredibly life-giving
 organization.
 We have really appreciated the Sage Hill people,
 their staff.
 We've just had tremendous experiences with them.
 And so we're deeply, deeply appreciative of them.
 We've been talking about the eight core feelings.
  </li><li>EJ, can you memorize them?
 Have you memorized them?
  </li><li>I don't know if I have them in order.
 I think, okay, you ready?
  </li><li>I'm ready.
  </li><li>Are you gonna, here's my question.
 Are you gonna put a slide up on the screen
 so they can't tell that I'm reading it off of a slide?
  </li><li>No, I want you to look at that camera
 and I want you to just like prove
 that you've memorized them, commit them to the memory.
  </li><li>So they would be hurt, lonely, sad.
 Maybe we should play feeling charades.
 Where I, you can't necessarily say what the charades should be.
 Okay, you ready?
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So you got hurt, lonely, sad, the next one is.
  </li><li>Matt, angry.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Oh, fear.
 That's not when.
  </li><li>That's shame, clearly.
 That's shame.
  </li><li>I'm just gonna be shy.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Maybe you should just read the list.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Shame. - Keep going, this is good.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Shame.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Pensive.
  </li><li>Guilt.
  </li><li>Pensive.
 Was pensive ever on the list?
 And then the last one is.
  </li><li>It glides.
  </li><li>Okay, well that was torture.
 Okay, we got hurt, lonely, sad, angry,
 fear, shame, guilt and glad.
 I still can't memorize them off the top of my head.
  </li><li>I really can't.
 I still like, if Alan's like, how are you feeling?
 I need to pull up this stinking chart on my phone.
  </li><li>Me too.
  </li><li>But I was looking at it every week for a while anyway.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Well, we talked about these eight core feelings.
 We've already talked about why there's only eight.
 And here's the beauty of them only being eight.
 Some people are like, "Ah, but that's super limiting.
 "It isn't limiting, it's beautiful."
 Because it forces you to A, have a common language,
 which is really good.
 But B, also helps you distill what you are feeling
 made out of those eight core ingredients.
 And the danger is, if we've been taught not to trust
 our feelings, not to value them,
 we end up with these kind of meta feelings
 where we say appropriate things
 that might not actually be true to what we're feeling.
 So we don't say I'm feeling fear.
 We're like, I have a little bit of anxiety.
 I've got butterflies in my tummy.
 We don't say that.
  </li><li>I feel a little off.
  </li><li>I feel a little off.
 You know, these kind of vague,
 that doesn't build into Missy or connection at all.
 And our challenge to you last week was,
 whenever you have something going on inside of you,
 do the work of stopping and going,
 okay, I'm feeling X.
 What is X made up of if I had to put my finger
 on one of those eight things?
 And our encouragement is try using these eight things
 'cause it moves you towards the truth
 of what's going on in your heart
 rather than the appeasement of what's going on in your head
 that makes it slightly more appropriate to be with people.
  </li><li>That's what I was gonna say is I have realized
 as a contemplative person who often,
 I'm thinking about something for ages
 before it ever makes it out of my face.
 It's helped me move from my head to my heart
 to have only eight.
 And then I can actually figure out what's going on with me,
 where all of the other words that I want to throw at how I'm feeling
 don't have a whole bunch of definitions,
 so they didn't help me very much.
  </li><li>Sure. - Yeah.
  </li><li>And it serves you to be really truthful with yourself,
 with God and with other people.
  </li><li>Yeah. - And these feelings,
 as restrictive as they initially felt,
 have actually become incredibly freeing for me.
  </li><li>Yeah, so good.
  </li><li>Last week, we all also introduced the concept
 that every feeling comes with two things.
 It comes with a--
  </li><li>An impairment. - Yes.
 and a gift.
  </li><li>And how do you get to the gift
 and how do you get to the impairment?
  </li><li>You get to the gift by feeling your feelings
 and you end up in the impairment
 by trying to avoid feeling your feelings
 or just shoving it down.
  </li><li>Yeah, so it's this amazing thing
 that all of these gifts are actually blessings from God.
 If you accept your human,
 if you realize I'm feeling this feeling,
 if you sit with the feeling,
 if you don't run away from it,
 if you sit with it, if you talk about it,
 if you begin a process and get in touch
 with what you're feeling,
 eventually you find the gift that's inherent with that feeling. And as AJ said, if you
 refuse to feel your feelings, if you're just, if you deny that that's what you're feeling,
 what ends up is you end up with an impairment that begins to like, eat out of the side and
 really begins to wreak havoc in your relationships.
 Yeah. So last week we talked about hurt. And this week we're going to talk about lonely.
 I was just thinking you didn't have to act out lonely. What would you have done for lonely?
 I didn't have to act out lonely. Why don't I have to act out lonely?
 Because I had already said, yeah.
 I don't know. I would probably have done an interpretive dance.
 Yeah.
 Too bad you missed out on my own in the background.
 Patrons look out for my interpretive dance coming later this week.
 Beautiful.
 Wait, now I feel like I have to do something.
 Okay, give me my Lycra body set we're going for.
 Oh dear.
 Okay.
 Loneliness. Before we can talk about loneliness, we have to talk about the two great needs
 that every human being faces and that's the need to belong and the need to matter. And loneliness
 speaks to both of those needs simultaneously. You're welcome. I lost the power of speech.
 You know, it's all right. I'm here for you. When we're aware of our loneliness, when we're
 feeling lonely, what it does is it actually motivates us toward getting both those needs
 met, belonging and mattering. So the important thing to understand about loneliness is it's not a curse.
 loneliness is actually a gift from God and you're like, Alan, how the heck does that make sense?
 Yeah. Like, I don't like feeling lonely. Where is the gift in that?
 Well, the gift in that is the Lord gave us loneliness so that we would be fuel to find relationship.
 Because we're built. We're built for relationship.
 So we'll move out of where we don't belong, which is feeling lonely. We experience this gift and
 it motivates us to connection and to friendship. It's interesting in Chip's book, he actually brings
 up the three different areas of loneliness that we can feel.
 So you can feel lonely with God.
 You can feel lonely with yourself and you can feel lonely with other people.
 And I think when I read that, I was like, wow, yeah, I can relate to all of those things.
 You know, it's that, what's that expression about, you know, you're in a room with a hundred
 people, but you still feel absolutely alone.
 Do you know that when I'm talking about there's some like catchy thing, we'll make it up later.
 Is that ancient Chinese proverb?
  </li><li>Yeah, we'll edit him when the dance gets added in.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's easy to see how you could be lonely
 with other people,
 'cause that's probably the one we're most aware of.
 You know where you're at a party
 and you feel like everybody knows everybody,
 but you're the odd person out,
 or you're having this conversation
 that will just not end, somebody's talking at you,
 rather than being with you and you feel lonely.
  </li><li>Oh, yes.
  </li><li>But this whole notion of being lonely with yourself
 is something I never, never considered
 until doing some group work,
 until reading Chip's book.
 Chip explains it as when we're lonely with ourself,
 we actually begin to feel our feelings,
 begin to feel what it's like to be with us,
 we get an understanding of our heart
 and appreciation for our heart,
 which in turn gives us fluency with other people's hearts
 and appreciation of other people's hearts.
 And I thought that was beautiful.
 The other thing he talks about is being lonely with God.
 And if you've been raising the church,
 you're just immediately putting Hebrews going,
 you know, I will never leave you, never forsake you.
 How could you possibly be lonely with God?
 Well, think about it, like in my journey with the Lord,
 it's always been the Lord pursuing me,
 me getting more of God, me delighting in the abundance
 of God, and then me realizing as much as I have,
 I still want more.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And that's because we're living on this side of eternity.
 So we're, you know, eternal spirits
 having a temporary human experience.
 We long to be with God.
 It says in scripture that God's set eternity
 in the hearts of man, that hunger, that longing,
 that desiring to be with the Lord is the loneliness that we feel.
 And it started right after the fall.
 The first game of hide and seek mentioned in the Bible is where Adam and Eve have sinned
 and the Lord's going like, "Where are you?"
 He doesn't already know.
 Right.
 It's like a child when you're playing hide and seek with a toddler, right?
 The adult absolutely knows where the child is.
 Adam and Eve, they laughed.
 They were deeply lonely with the Lord and he went pursue them.
 I had that this week.
 I realized that I was, I don't know if I was angry at God.
 I think I had feelings I didn't want to feel and a lot of them were about the Lord and I realized I was just hiding from the Lord
 Like I'm like that's insane and what I didn't do was I didn't feel my loneliness
 With the Lord I tried to avoid it by Netflix and by food and by video games
 And eventually in the patience of the Lord actually what happened was I had a deadline for work
 And I was like Lord you and I both know I can't accomplish this deadline without you
 But it seems churchless with me sit down and just say could you give me answers for this test?
 I actually need to be with you first of all and then suddenly being with the Lord course corrected all this
 ungodly thinking I had about you know being with the Lord and yeah
 You know all that sort of stuff, but that was my loneliness with the Lord being met with the Lord
 Did any of that make any sense? Yeah, it was good. Yeah, it was cute. You're so cute that it's distracting at times
 I have to say I should just look this way
 But there's a monitor where you can just see me. I know but I'm trying not to look at that. Okay
 How's that working? It's looking it's working okay right now. What about if I take my shirt off? Oh dear
 Back I've got her like that. So we know what it's like to be lonely with other people
 I've tried to describe I don't know if I butchered it being lonely with God being lonely with ourselves
 AJ Jones, what is the gift of feeling lonely?
 The gift of feeling lonely
 So if we choose to feel lonely then we ultimately end up with intimacy and connection and we saw a little bit of that last week
 Didn't we?
 Remember we were talking about feelings?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And you were talking about feeling lonely.
 Remember we had, this is kind of like pillow talk.
 You were like, I feel sad, I feel lonely.
 And then I asked like, hey, what does it feel like,
 processing?
 You're like, I feel less lonely.
  </li><li>Better, I feel less lonely.
  </li><li>Here's the thing that I'm really angry about,
 like passionate about is all of this stuff
 that we're talking about,
 if you only buy the book and read the book
 or only listen to the podcast, it's not enough.
 Because somehow it doesn't make sense.
 So I sit with my Lola and suddenly I feel connected.
 That does not make sense.
 Yeah, it doesn't.
 But it's like the best things in life.
 I could describe how good chocolate is
 or how sweet strawberries are.
 But it's better if you eat the strawberries
 and eat the chocolate yourself to get an understanding.
 Right.
 Feelings work in theory only is just,
 it's gonna be empty.
 So it's crazy.
 You've--
 You have to do the work.
 You have to actually try.
 You sit in your lonely and you feel connected.
 One of the things we notice in group, when we do group work,
 well, I might share and then the group facilitator might be like,
 "Hey, who has feedback for Alan and what it's like to be with him?"
 And just that process of being vulnerable with other people in a group,
 even though they can't fix your problem,
 even though they can't change the things that you might feel hurt, sad, lonely,
 or whatever about, just actually doing the work of bringing your feelings,
 making them visible to the outside, giving the gift of yourself to other people.
 It's amazing how connected, how not lonely.
 We joke because the gift of lonely is intimacy,
 but it feels weird to say, well,
 how do you feel being without it?
 I feel really intimate.
 So we find words to not sound like it's intimate.
 I feel less lonely.
 You mean intimate?
 Yes.
 But the--
  </li><li>Known?
  </li><li>Yeah, I feel known, feel understood, feel connected,
 feel like a belong, feel like a matter.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Intimacy.
 Connection.
 Super important.
 What about the impairment?
 If we refuse to feel our loneliness,
 which by the way, Chip says that loneliness is the feeling
 that we as humans work the hardest to not feel,
 which is a bold statement.
 So if we're doing all that work to not feel lonely,
 to deny our hearts, needs of connection,
 what do we end up with?
  </li><li>We end up with apathy.
  </li><li>Oh, apathy.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And apathy is this impaired attempt to pretend
 we don't care that we are lonely.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Which is really denying how we're made.
 Right. So it never works. It really, you have to basically stunt everything to stay in apathy and not, you know, and not feel other things you're trying to avoid feeling.
 Right. So think about it. With all the eight feelings, this is the one that human race is desperately trying not to feel.
 Yeah.
 And, you know, apathy is just this best attempt to deny how we're made. Like, I don't, I don't need people. I don't need connection.
 And ironically, the thing that we most often run to is TV shows about other people who are not lonely.
 So the reason we love friends and the reason we love, you know, all these TV shows is we get to sit on the edges of other people doing intimacy.
 That's so funny.
 It's true. Yeah.
 Yeah.
 But we try and hide or mask our our loneliness.
 Yeah.
 So I'm refusing to feel lonely because, you know what, like, I'm a dude.
 I don't need all this intimate nonsense. Like I'm fine. You know what mean Jesus. We're best friends
 I don't even need people. Yeah, I've got the me plus the Trinity has the majority
 I'm totally fine. I don't even need connection don't need people right the religious line
 Trinity so what is that how am I gonna be experienced like what's the type of stuff an apathetic person says
 Stuff like I don't even care about that does it that doesn't matter to me right?
 Yeah, I don't care. Yeah, the mayor it's fine
 And we and we deride anybody else who's having legitimate connections. Yeah. Oh my god. Look at that person. They're so needy. They're weak
 Oh my gosh. Look at them. Oh, you see you need people like I don't need people. I'm totally fine
 It's like no you do you absolutely do you're built to need people yeah
 And here's the other crazy thing is the Holy Spirit
 Jesus the father they want to be in relationship with you like they want to have intimacy
 They want to have connection. So if we haven't practiced the skills the same place in our heart where we connect with other people
 It's the same place in our heart where we connect with the Father
 So if we're like God is okay, but people will only let me down
 So I'm not gonna be intimate with them. We're having a substandard connection with the Father
 Well, it doesn't work because I think once you build walls against feeling your emotions
 You can't just choose who gets to go on what side of it
 I think you end up walling out God in the process of walling out people
 Well, it says like, you know, you can't say that you love God whom you can't see but hate your brother whom you can
 Like you're in total denial if that's your situation, which by the way was absolutely my whole life
 So I'm preaching to the choir. You don't have a brother
 I'm just kidding. Sorry
 Let's go back and talk about sadness
 Sarcaste on there somewhere yes
 We'll get to sad sarcasm and chips at this in his book in his book the voice of the heart says this
 This apathy is the opposite of love.
 Loneliness acknowledges the need for love.
 Apathy attempts to negate it.
 Onack knowledge loneliness makes orphans of us all.
 Chip.
 I know it's brutal.
 Why you gotta go there, Chip?
 Oh, but it's so true.
 David, King David, so good at feeling his feelings.
 Like you read the book of Psalms, it's one big feelings journal.
 All right.
 He's having lots of feelings.
 Feeling festival.
 But one of the things about David was he was so good at feeling his feelings
 And you can actually chart the path of his feelings and him finding the gifts. Let me read you this
 This is Psalm 25 verse 16 and David said this he says turn to me and be gracious to me
 For I am lonely and afflicted here. We're saying that his loneliness
 Leads him to the Lord him feeling his feelings takes him to be with the Lord right he finds his need by feeling his feelings
 He's basically like, "I am so lonely.
 Would you come, please come be with me?"
 Right. And he knows that God actually isn't threatened by us feeling our feelings.
 Right.
 We're allowed to feel our feelings.
 We're built to have feelings.
 God built us that way.
 And that's one of the things I actually love about the Psalms is for those that want to argue that,
 you know, we're not supposed to be emotional people.
 Well, David certainly was.
 And God said he was a man after God's own heart.
 So it seems like feeling your feelings is actually maybe a really good thing.
 Right.
 The solution to our loneliness is to embrace the loneliness and find out where it
 leads us, not deny it and pretend that it doesn't exist.
 Right.
 Which you can't anyway.
 At some point that beach ball comes back up.
 Right.
 So pretending you're not lonely.
 Yeah.
 Like pushing that beach ball under the water.
 Yeah.
 It's going to, you know, come back up with spectacular results.
 And the other thing is all you're doing when you're denying your loneliness is pretending you're not lonely.
 Like you become inauthentic.
 You actually move yourself further from the authentic relationships that you're built to have.
 Yeah.
 So we're talking about David.
 That is Psalm 25.
 By the time we get to Psalm 68, David says this, God sets the lonely in families.
 Ah, wow.
 I love that.
 See, David has the revelation that this is what the Father wants to do for us.
 In our loneliness, he wants to put us where we belong and where we matter.
 That might not be your family of origin, by the way, the family you grew up in
 might not be the place where you're going to feel like you belong in matter.
 Like for me, our culture at Grace Center, I feel like I belong in matter at Grace Center.
 I feel like I have a community of people who love me and celebrate me, even in all
 my weaknesses and all my quirks.
 Yeah.
 It's a beautiful, beautiful thing when you find your tribe and you find the place where you belong.
 And it's God's heart for you to experience that.
 And if you're like, I haven't found that yet, it could be because you haven't been feeling your feelings of loneliness.
 Yeah.
 I think too, if in just thinking about the role of parents and their role is to call their children to life,
 if we didn't have that in our families of origin, the Lord is so good that He puts other people around us
 that will actually be the people that call us to life.
 And those end up being usually like lifetime relationships.
 But honestly, like when I think about who my family are,
 they're all over the world in many ways.
 And there are certainly, you know, plenty of them here
 but there's plenty of them still in Toronto and whatever,
 you know, that are, they are my family,
 but they're not my blood,
 but God put me in a family to heal my heart
 and to teach me about trusting others and community and health.
  </li><li>And it's beautiful to be able to go home,
 so to speak, to be with the people that love you
 and feel like you belong, feel like you matter.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>So what do you do?
 We wanna leave you with this.
 I mean, this is our third feeling
 that we've been talking about,
 your loneliness, if you feel your loneliness,
 it leads to connection, leads to intimacy.
 If you refuse to feel your loneliness
 and you end up in apathy, which is this impaired attempt
 to deny that you're human and you don't need other people.
 So if in listening to this, if in watching these videos,
 you're like, okay, it sounds like I need to do
 some feelings work around lonely.
 Where is the best place to start?
  </li><li>I would start by journaling about it.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I would start by sitting with the Lord
 and just being like, "Wow, I think maybe I am running
 "from my lonely."
 God, can we have a conversation about this?
  </li><li>Do a lonely inventory.
 Where do I feel lonely in life?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Do I feel lonely at work?
 Who do I feel lonely with?
 You know, do a little chart, okay, sorry,
 left brainer wants to make a chart. But like examine, like just do this inventory of where
 do I feel lonely? Where do I feel less lonely? Who do I feel less lonely with? Just begin to talk
 to the Lord when we talk about journaling, we're just talking about writing out your prayers to the
 Lord and listening for what he might want to have to say about that. We'll put a link in our show
 notes where we teach four steps to journaling to hear in God's voice. But really, really powerful
 first step of actually talking about your lonely. If you're in a community of people who are listening
 to this podcast altogether and you've got some historical friendships with these people,
 begin talking about like what does it feel like for you to be lonely. I want to jump in a little
 bit with a personal testimony. I mean, I am very, very acquainted with lonely. I didn't realize
 I was but in doing group work, I began to realize, wow, I am so familiar with the feeling of lonely
 and I've built really elaborate systems to try and get the needs of lonely met without having to
 feel lonely, which is by the way, disaster. But one of the things, Aj and I commented on,
 since doing this healing work, I would say pre doing the feelings work, I realized that a lot
 of the men, especially that I really esteemed that I really looked up to all had one thing in common.
 Now, I didn't know this before doing this, where I didn't have the vocabulary for it,
 but they were all very smart people, but they were all people who had excelled at being okay
 with being lonely and not feeling lonely. Yeah. I mean, that's a clunky way of saying it.
 So there were people, leaders, men who, you know, when I was around, I'm like, oh, they validate
 my approach to life, which is, you know, fortress of solitude. I'm fine. Just me and Jesus and I've
 I've got a wife and that's great.
 And then the more and more work I did around feelings
 when I would be around these people,
 I would be like, what has happened?
 Like, what's wrong?
 What's happened to them?
 And it's just like, there's nothing wrong with them.
 Like, nothing has changed since the last time you saw them.
 What's changed is your appetite for connection.
 And I'm like, oh, and I had this realization
 that actually I'd built my connection, my identity,
 around not needing people.
 And now that I'm a needy person who desires connection,
 I'm realizing where previously these people
 was scintillating conversation for me now
 when I'm with them, I'm just like,
 I feel really lonely with them
 because we're talking all about abstract stuff up here
 and never going near the heart.
 And so it's so funny what that does.
 And I'm realizing, gosh,
 how many people have felt lonely with me over the years?
 I had a dear friend, I have a dear friend
 and we were talking a couple of months ago
 about this feelings work
 And he said, Alan, my experience of being with you prior to you doing this healing work was me constantly thinking of interesting things to keep your attention.
 Because if you weren't interested, it felt lonely being with you.
 And I was like, I am so that sounds lonely being with me.
 And he said, and now like being, you know, having you haven't done this feelings work, I feel like I can connect and be with you.
 And I'm not trying to think of complex things that might interest you.
 And I'm like, Oh, and that that what he was
 describing was such a familiar feeling for me.
 Yeah.
 And I was like, oh, that's so sad so lonely.
 Yeah.
 I think my lonely manifested a little bit differently.
 Like we were talking before the show about, you know, can I remember seasons of
 loneliness?
 I can remember years and years of loneliness.
 Uh, you know, particularly teenage late, late teenage, early twenties, you know,
 uh, before I started going to the church in Toronto and started, uh,
 experiencing healthy family. Right. But I would say I had as a survivor. Apathy was a great tool for
 me. Oh, of course. Because as long as I didn't care, then it didn't matter what had been done to me.
 It didn't matter how much more was going to be done. It didn't matter about anything really.
 If I could shove that thing down and just survive it, survive everything. And I remember coming in
 contact with like John and Carol and other people that are safe people for me in Toronto.
 And they did feel things and they did show real emotion and they did, you know, cry and
 all the things that I didn't allow myself to cry.
 You know, like just feelings were something I wanted as far from me as humanly possible.
 But I knew I was so lonely.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I sort of got affronted by that
 'cause I couldn't choose God
 and choose the Holy Spirit and choose lonely.
 And so I remember just feeling like everything was sort of,
 wow, this is all new and scary.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>'Cause now I have this choice of,
 wow, do I live life the way I'm created to live?
 Or do I continue surviving life?
  </li><li>Right.
 which was working for me, but it wasn't working for me.
 You know?
  </li><li>What about now, like, in starting all of this feelings
 work and having new language, what have you noticed
 in our relationship and your relationship
 for other people and our appetites for connection?
 Like, what do you notice is shifted?
  </li><li>I would say, oh gosh, what shifted?
 I cry more.
 I feel things more and let myself feel things more.
 I really only want authentic and real relationship.
 I don't want to do shallow.
 I don't want to do surface.
 I never really liked shallower surface before,
 but I use that as an excuse to back away from everybody.
 So I think there's probably a lot different.
 That's a good question.
 I probably want to contemplate it a little bit more.
 What have you seen?
  </li><li>I was just thinking, I went for some ministry
 many years ago, like three, maybe three and a half,
 four years ago, I went for some ministry.
 because the most, and this is before I'd done
 any feelings work, the largest presenting issue
 in my life at that time was boredom.
 And my boredom was leading me to sabotage
 my personal and professional relationships
 'cause I was just bored.
 And so I booked some ministry with some really skilled
 ministers and I go in to see them and it's Denise and Ginger.
 And I sit down there like, okay, so like what,
 you've come for some ministry,
 what would you like us to minister into?
 And I'm like, well, you know, the kind of the biggest presenting issue for me is in my personal and professional life, I am constantly bored.
 And I'm worried that in my boredom, I'm beginning to sabotage relationships because I want something more.
 And they're like, oh, so you're bored.
 And they said, we found that boredom is just loneliness with a touch of anger.
 Now, I hadn't done any of this feelings work at all.
 So I, you know, and I'm not even sure if they were using this terminology.
 I didn't know.
 I was like, yes, a lot of my life like that apathy.
 If you think about a teenager, you know, who doesn't want to feel their feelings like,
 "Hey, you having a fun time?" like, "Oh, I'm just so bored."
 You know, we're going to move to this, to interest me.
 I'm not engaging. And for the bulk of my human life, you know, bulk of my human life.
 For the bulk of my adult life, I have been bored.
 Yeah.
 And in today's parlance, I would say that I was feeling lonely with anger, anger for connection.
 And so I remember, I don't know when it was maybe six months ago,
 A.G. and I were out for dinner. Being bored is a terrible thing for a pastor to be,
 because I'm paid to care and sit and be with people. And if I'm all of a sudden bored,
 like, you know, people are going to feel that boredom. You cannot hide what you're feeling.
 It's going to come out. And we've had a couple of those
 Confidentions, one time, A.G. and I had to do an interview, one time, A.G. and I had to do an interview for a
 position at Grace and we're interviewing a staff position. And I was having a, I was having a really bad
 attitude. And so, A.G. and I went out for dinner with this person who's being interviewed for this
 position. And it became fairly clear, fairly early on that this was probably not going to work out
 position. So now I've got to the end of the point of why I'm here. Like within about five minutes,
 I'm like, this is probably not going to work. And so in my head, I'm like, well, we're done,
 you know, like there's no point, you know, but we've just ordered our starters, we still have the
 main course and dessert. So I am struggling to maintain connection. Now, please, please understand,
 this is me being dishonoring. This is me being immature. This is me not on my best behavior. This
 this is not kind to the person we're with,
 but I'm thinking they probably don't even notice, right?
 I'm thinking I'm hiding how bored I am.
  </li><li>Well, yeah, I think we were both struggling
 and I just used the kids to help me check out.
 Like they were there and I needed, you know what I mean?
 Like, so I think we both checked out of the conversation
 but we didn't think it was that obvious that we had.
  </li><li>I thought we were super skilled at hiding how we're feeling.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Well, this person rightly so is so dishonored
 that they actually send an email to our HR person at the time
 and just saying, hey, thank you for the weekend.
 It feels like this is not going to be a good fit.
 We really enjoyed meeting you.
 Can we be honest though?
 We had a really negative experience with Alan and AJ.
 They just felt really bored.
 They felt really disconnected.
 And so, you know--
 And they were right.
 And they were right.
 And I was like shocked.
 But I'm so good at hiding what I'm feeling.
 Nobody's good at hiding what you're feeling.
 Everybody is experiencing what you're experiencing
 of the time. And I mean, I tell that story with chagrin, with sorrow, with deep sadness,
 I wrote to that person and I apologize to them. I said, Hey, you called it correctly.
 I, you know, I can't apologize enough. I was unprofessional of me. It was un-Christlike of me.
 It was not kind of me. But that was me refusing to feel that I am lonely in this situation. And
 I'm just thinking the problem was them. I tell that story as a contrast to say, that wasn't an
 uncommon feeling for me to be to be bored. Yeah, I mean, I would say I've noticed the more that
 I've been willing to feel emotion, actually, the more I feel connected to people. And so I enjoy,
 I enjoy the stories more. I really want to get to know people. Where before I probably really
 wanted to get to know some people, right? Where now I really enjoy everybody. Like, I'm enjoying
 people's stories. I'm enjoying people because I'm actually willing to feel stuff.
 That was the crescendo I was reaching to. Oh, like now, what's fine. Now what I've realized is,
 and you've, you know, I've said to you, we've gone out for dinner with people as, you know,
 we're in pastoral, we're meeting with people, and we won't be having a meeting. And I'm like,
 I'm loving their story. I'm wanting to be with them. I'm feeling way less lonely. I'm, you know,
 want to ask questions because my curiosity is leading me to want to connect with people.
 And that sadly is like a new feeling for me.
 Yeah, in the last couple of years.
 Yeah.
 But I love it.
 So good.
 So there you go.
 Feeling lonely is a gift from God.
 It will lead you to connection.
 I highly encourage you doing it.
 One of the things that everybody needs to know.
 We're talking about places to belong and matter.
 We have the glorious opportunity of working at Grace Center,
 which as a culture as a church, places a high value
 on the healing of the heart and on connection
 and wholehearted living.
 And we have a school of, really, of transformation.
 I was gonna call it a school of ministry,
 but it's not for those who wanna be in ministry,
 it's those who wanna live life fully.
  </li><li>Right. - It's called
 The School of Supernatural Life.
 It starts in September, runs through to April.
 Our applications for the school are open.
 You would come here, you would do the school
 in gorgeous Franklin, Tennessee.
 And it's gonna be the 11th year
 that we're running the school, is that right?
  </li><li>It is, yeah, this is. - 11 years
 we've been running it. - Yeah.
 The school now has three years.
 They're all optional.
 So year one is the main year that most people do.
 And then if you wanted to continue,
 you could do year two or year three.
 And the applications closed June 15th.
 So yeah, we're excited about this year
 and I'm super excited about some of the speakers
 we already have booked for this year.
 So yeah, it's really exciting.
  </li><li>We'll put a link in the show notes.
 You can watch videos and test mains
 of people who've absolutely had their life transformed just in eight months.
 It's amazing.
 A.G. and I have the privilege of doing a large amount of teaching on the school.
 We bring in just experts in their fields from all over the world to come and
 minister and it's open to everybody as long as you've finished high school.
 Our youngest student has been 17.
 Our oldest student has been 77 full range.
 I don't know.
 Yeah, 70 some runs on Mondays and Tuesdays will put a link in the show.
 would really encourage you if you're looking for a change,
 if you're looking for something more full living
 than come to our school of supernatural life,
 would love to have you.
