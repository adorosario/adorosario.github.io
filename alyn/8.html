<p> Hey babe. Hello. You know, you're looking pretty fantastic today. I feel fantastic.
 You don't like a day over 40.<br/>
 Well, that's amazing because I am a day over 40. You are indeed. Happy birthday to me.
 All right, before we talk about how awesome my birthday party was. Let's talk about this week.
 Okay. Our week started. Actually, our week started last week. We got a phone call from a
 with your friend of ours who said, "Hey, we have a friend with an amazing testimony
 who has just given their testimony at Bethel.
 They're currently at IHOP, giving their testimony.
 Would you like them to come speak at Emmonate?"
 And we were like, "Yes."<br/>
 Well, we were like, "Give us a brief synopsis."
 I wasn't.<br/>
 I was like, "With that pedigree?<br/>
 Yes, she can come share."<br/>
 But he gave us a synopsis.<br/>
 Tell us a synopsis, baby.<br/>
 Well, the synopsis is basically that she grew up Muslim, met the Lord through a series
 of dreams in a Muslim nation with a father who's an iman and met the Lord
 through a series of dreams and you know encounters really yeah gave her life to
 the Lord very radically and essentially I mean the story is huge but basically
 she ended up dying in a terrorist attack on her church and she came back to life
 And so she saw Jesus had an encounter with Jesus, had a discussion with him, chose to come back,
 and pretty wild stuff.<br/>
 At this point, I'd like to applaud you, babe, because that is the best condensed version of a story I've ever heard you tell.
 Wow, thanks, darling.<br/>
 Removed of all the bonding trails and details that women normally love to include.
 That's because right after we're done recording this podcast, I plan on having a nap before the baby wakes up.
 It's amazing what motivation sleep will do.
 Yeah, Samar Habib and her sister were with us at M&amp;A.
 Samar's written a book called Face to Face with Jesus.
 And I haven't read it because I just got it yesterday.
 But if it's--<br/>
 Lacker.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 If it's M&amp;A like the story that she shared or a test
 when she shared on Monday, it's going to be incredible.
 If you didn't tune in Monday night and hear at M&amp;A,
 if you check the show notes, you have got about three weeks
 to download it before we take it off our podcast server.
 But have a listen to incredible, incredible story.
 Yeah, they're both really lovely as well, aren't they?
 I think we've fallen in love with them.
 Yeah, we want to adopt them. They're just adorable.
 It seems weird to go from incredible resurrection from the dead
 and complete transformation test mace of Jesus to talk about food.
 But look, I just made that transition seamlessly.
 Wow, that was amazing.<br/>
 Let's talk about food this week.<br/>
 Our food did not get resurrected from the dead.
 It stayed dead and we ate it.<br/>
 Oh my gosh.<br/>
 I think it was so good.<br/>
 I helped see how I helped with the transition.
 You did, babe.<br/>
 That was amazing.<br/>
 It was the first time I have ever cooked lamb.
 And I'll tell you why I was super nervous about cooking lamb is it's very hard to overcook it.
 And then it's not nice at all.<br/>
 And also it's very easy to overcook.<br/>
 Oh, yeah, sorry.<br/>
 Yeah, it's very easy to overcook it.<br/>
 And then it's not very nice at all.<br/>
 And then I think because the only lamb we've had really since we've been here is the stuff
 that's been prepared by Jeff Dollar.<br/>
 Yes, which is outstanding. I think we can prepare. I think we can agree that Jeff dollar is the lamb
 mister. He's just a grill mister. Really? He is brilliant on the grill. He absolutely is. I don't
 think I've ever eaten anything that Jeff dollar is prepared that has not been absolutely delicious.
 It's true. They're like a little cooking family over there. So I called Jeff and asked for his
 recipe, which he very generously gave me. And then I tried it. And it was so good. We had
 there were French lamb chops.<br/>
 Whether the next night, though, that good.
 But I deviated from his recipe slightly.
</p><ul>
  <li>Don't tell him.
  </li><li>No, I won't.
  </li><li>We won't record anything that says that either.
  </li><li>Nope.
  </li><li>And then you happen to,
 in the process of preparing for my party,
 which we're gonna talk about in a second,
 you happen to make like nine gallons of...
  </li><li>11 cups.
  </li><li>11 cups nine gallons.
 We got a bathed in the amount of Greek dressing
 that you made.
  </li><li>Actually, it might have been more than 11 cups, really.
  </li><li>It was a long one.
  </li><li>Oh, but you're Greek dressing.
 Well, there's a restaurant in Toronto that I just love the Greek salad there and I
 it took me a couple years.
 And the restaurant, you haven't to live in Toronto, you need to go to the restaurant,
 you don't need to, you've got free will, you can do whatever you want.
 Oh, the name's just suddenly escaped my, well, Laturna, that's what it is.
 There we go.
 Laturna at Young and Steel's. Anyway, I love the Greek salad and so I've been trying to
 manufacture that dressing for years. So about maybe a year and a half ago or two years ago,
 I finally got to a dressing that I like either as much as or more than LaTurna's dressing.
 What did you make up the recipe for the dressing?
 Yes, mostly.
 Well, it's a combination of a couple of...
 Yes, so I suppose so because everything's a combination of something, isn't it?
 Yes, I mixed some things together until I came up with something I loved.
 Okay, perfect.
 But anyway, you had leftovers and what did you do with it?
 I decided to put it in our quinoa.
 To go with the lamb, I made a Mediterranean quinoa.
 So, you know, onions and green peppers and tomatoes and oh, it's so good.
 I'm sorry.
 It's probably pretty cruel that we talk about food every week while you're listening to
 this and it's unlikely you're listening to this while eating.
 It is.
 It is rather mean.
 So I'm sorry for it was horrible.
 It was horrible, horrible quinoa.
 But actually we do have a coming plan and a couple of weeks will tell you.
 Well, we love talking about food period, but there is another reason we're talking about
 food and then a couple of weeks on our podcast will tell you why that is.
 Do I know why that you don't just came to me in my head.
 Oh, okay.
 Well, I'm so excited.
 So you're right.
 Another reason why we're both smiling is what happens today, babe.
 We're on vacation.
 On vacation.
 And our kids don't know what to do with it.
 This has been a particularly intense six weeks.
 No, it's particularly intense six months.
 Starting in January, it just seems like it has not slowed down till June.
 Yeah.
 So we are taking two weeks off, which we're super excited about.
 And so we're looking forward to being on vacation, which is super exciting.
 Anyway, I want to jump on and talk about readers questions.
 Twitter user and owl says who, uh, via our website, asked the question,
 I would love to know what your favorite qualities are in each other.
 Love the podcast.
 Thank you so much.
 Maybe one of your favorite qualities.
 Um, clearly it's your, um, amazing rations and, um,
 undoubtedly your hair cuts.
 No, that's not right. I'm so sorry. I would say probably your integrity, your love for
 being integris is definitely one of my favorite qualities.
 I beat set the body of a Greek god.
 Just barely. Just barely. Yeah. And I like your sense of humor, of course.
 Praise god, because if you didn't, I would have driven you nuts by now.
 That's true.
 Did every person say one is it our top three and those qualities plural
 oh the sake of the brevity of the podcast let's limit the top three
 okay and
 uh
 uh
 it's supposed to be like character things
 just as qualities
 I love how well you love me
 oh thanks
 my little words of affirmation meters
 off the charts right now
 It's easy for me to answer this because we were actually talking to some friends earlier
 this week and they actually asked us what attracted us to each other when we first met.
 And it still remains one of my favorite qualities about you is that you're a pursuit of having
 your heart healed up.
 You're very good at owning your stuff and you're very good at pursuing Jesus for healing of
 the stuff that you're not happy with.
 I can't remember when I first met you and you shared your story on the school of ministry up in Toronto and you were with us Monday through Friday.
 I remember every day just thinking, how are you still alive? How are you functioning? How are you so happy? How have you endured so much and yet you don't have any of the aftertaste of people who've been through trauma?
 I just love how well you've not just persevered but you've been transformed.
 I think that's just amazing.
 You've allowed God to do that brilliantly.
 I also love your sense that you're telling nothing.
 I love about you because everybody negatively when we got engaged said, you know what?
 You better buy all the electronics and all that sort of stuff you want before you get
 married because women don't like buying stuff.
 And that's just never been the case with you.
 One of the things I love about you is you like to buy, you like excellence.
 Quality stuff.
 I'd rather save up and get actually the quality thing that's going to last.
 I'd rather have nothing bad, rather nothing if it's really quality and mediocre.
 Yeah, I'd rather have nothing than something mediocre. So I love that you love to research
 things and I love that you take great care in the stuff that we buy and purchase and you tend to
 value the same things I value. I love that. And then you remain one of my favorite speakers,
 period. I love when you speak. I love when you share.
 Thanks, baby.
 Which is just as well if you think about it.
 Yeah, because we have to listen to each other a lot.
 I know if we didn't. And then you're an amazing mom.
 I don't know. Amazing.
 Oh, thank you.
 Thank you for that.
 Plus you're looking exceptionally hot last night on my birthday.
 Oh, thank you.
 Wait. I had a birthday. Let's talk about that.
 You did. Let's talk about that. What do you want to talk about, baby?
 How did you get everything done?
 Oh, my gosh. Well, I stayed up late every single night.
 So most nights I was up to 12 or one
 Anyway, trying to get stuff done. So I I kind of
 There cuz there was so much to do and it was such a big party
 I broke it down into what I could get done each night ahead of time and
 You know made stuff like dressings and all that kind of stuff
 I mean just did everything I could ahead of time and did all the rest rest pulling off
 So for those who don't know I just turned 40
 Yesterday and AJ just we talked in January
 What do you want to do if you're birthday Ellen?
 And typically, I don't, typically I really like small events for my birthday.
 Maybe you usually say, yeah, two or three couples and that's it.
 We go out for dinner and I like a small event.
 And but this year I thought, actually, I think I'd probably not resent, but I'd
 probably resent the choice I made not to celebrate me, which sounds really, really
 weird.
 But I thought I would actually like a large party.
 Yeah.
 Be surrounded by the people that you love.
 Yeah. And so you pulled it off. There was maybe 50, 60 people. And you fed them all.
 So talk to me about that. Because I hosted your 40th birthday party and recruited some people to
 help me. And it was enormously stressful, but in a good way. So it's not like I didn't enjoy it.
 It was just all consuming. And I'm not a very good multitasker. So it was the only thing I got
 accomplished. I didn't bathe or see the children. Or I got it done. And it was just like a mission
 on a task and it's done. It's been implemented. Okay, let's go. I'm not sure how south of
 it you felt by me, but so touch me. What was it like pulling off an event like that?
 Well, I was not only pulling off the event but trying to pull off a book of honor, which was
 actually probably more work than the event itself. Right. Describe the book of honor for people who
 don't know. Listen context. Well, so when you were 30, I made you a book of honoring words from friends
 that you had all over the world. And because you're a words of affirmation guy, that's what I did
 to do as your president. And so I decided because that still remains one of your favorite
 presence you've ever gotten to do it again this year, with a whole group of new people, plus a
 whole bunch of people that from Scotland and Toronto and so with that.
 It was amazing. So the context there is historically my birthdays, I've felt, I hope it doesn't offend
 anybody have been fairly non-eventful. So like growing up, I think my dad probably instilled
 us in us, but he was like, "Yeah, what's the point of a birthday just another day?"
 You don't say that about himself, not really about ours, but we probably picked up and learned
 from him that, "Oh, birthdays aren't that big a deal." So I don't ever remember my birthdays
 being amazing. Then I got to North America where technically I would imagine most North
 Americans are better at celebrating things than my experience of growing up. And so for my 30th
 birthday, you pulled off a complete surprise birthday party, which was very clever.
 And at that time in my life, I was living in Toronto.
 I had like 30 people hiding in my basement.
 Yeah.
 I, well, you did something very, very clever.
 You organized a party for me, I think, on, on the Friday night, but you actually threw
 my party on the Thursday night, something like that.
 So I didn't actually organize the party for the Friday night.
 I just lied to you and told you there was a party.
 And so everybody.
 Great marriage.
 Everybody said I can't wait to see you on Friday or whatever the day was and actually it was a surprise
 Friday night. It was just great shock and awe, but at that time I lived in Canada
 I left all my friends in Scotland and everybody I came to do the school with had left. So basically I was
 I don't want to say alone, but I was alone and I was busy borrowing my friends. I was wearing your friends
 Yeah, that's exactly what was happening. I was transitioning to your friendship circle, which is never really that easy
 Because you're not sure if people like you for you or they like you because they have to like you because you're the boyfriend of the girl that they are like right,
 but I am high words of affirmation high words of affirmation high physical touch basically I just want you to lie on top of me and tell me that I'm awesome.
 And we weren't married to that one.
 So you arrange this book which was.
 I would say probably the best gift of ever been given in my life and I'm being in lots of amazing gifts because I have this book.
 There's beautifully bound and has all these words of affection and honor from people all over the world my parents my family people i grew up with.
 I just saying hey this is the impact you've made on our life which was just amazing so i often read through well 10 years later you did it again.
 And yes after you give to me i just kind of wet as i read it was amazing thank you everybody contribute to that it was incredible.
 you're saying that took more work than pulling off the awesome party that we had last.
 Oh yeah, way more work. I would say, oh, I don't even know that had to be 20 or 30 hours worth of work.
 Why just couldn't get the printer to work or stuff like that, but also, you know,
 no, it was just like collating all the stuff and then putting it all into hell,
 a little bit of canoe and making sure it was in the font that you liked.
 Just cutting out.
 Imagine, here's the words of honor, but I styled it in papyrus.
 And then I sent all the pictures to Costco and then Costco's machine broke and then I had
 to try and figure out how to do it with another provider whose website wasn't very helpful.
 So there was a lot of moments of frustration.
 Plus I wanted it to look pretty,
 so I did different colors of paper,
 drop shadowing behind them, pictures, or yeah, I just--
  </li><li>There's a lot of work for something inherently analog.
 There are probably the two only analog things
 I have on the house I like,
 I'm gonna aside from you and the kids.
  </li><li>Thanks, thanks darling.
  </li><li>I have more data ways to digitize you guys yet.
  </li><li>I think I'm thankful.
  </li><li>It was beautiful love, I really, really appreciate
 That book, it's absolutely amazing.
 I think I'm gonna, there's some bits in there
 that just royally made me laugh.
 I'll take some choice quotes out and put them
 on the website for you to have a look at
 if you're interested.
 Talk about the party.
 Oh gosh, I sense for bossy tonight.
 I don't mean to be bossy.
 Talk about the party.
 But the party was amazing.
 Let's talk about it.
 So Rachel and Ronson hosted it for us.
 That's our dear friends and our wonderful chiropractor.
 And they were awesome.
 I just worked tirelessly all day to get everything ready for us to be safe.
 Well, they have the party house.
 Oh, it's an awesome house.
 Gorgeous, absolutely.
 The open plan, tons of space.
 Yeah.
 The weather was forecast.
 I just rain all day, but you rebuked the weather.
 I did.
 I rolled my eyes going, oh, you and you're rebuking the weather.
 And then later repented when you're rebuking the weather did work and we had amazing weather.
 And not only dried up, but it got nice and sunny and even the grass was nice.
 Yeah.
 Maybe you could rebuke my weight.
 It'd be great weight loss.
 pretty sure that that's really going to come down to discipline thing, not a
 review thing. Sorry about that.
 Be picky about what you play for when.
 So, yeah, we just did a big barbecue and I made some salads, Rachel
 minus salad and Pete Mary, a couple different people brought things.
 And we just had fun. We had like a whole, yeah, barbecue thing.
 And then I had a dessert table at the end and we had fun.
  </li><li>And as a high introvert,
 I basically managed all my energy this week
 by seeing nobody so that I'd have enough energy
 last night to connect and be intentional.
 And well, I really wanted to connect with everybody.
 So at a great time, I mean, normally I don't
 enlarge groups of people, but I had really a thorough,
 great time thoroughly enjoyed having a great time.
 It was great to see so many people come out.
 I had a fantastic idea for the party.
  </li><li>Yes, you did.
  </li><li>I really love the Jimmy Fallon lip sync battles.
 And so I texted a bunch of extroverted people and said,
 "Hey guys, do any of you want to do a lip sync,
 "limp lip, lip sync battle?"
 And a bunch of them said, "Yeah."
 So there was like, I don't know,
 six of them or something that did a lip sync battle.
  </li><li>They did a phenomenal.
  </li><li>Whenever you try and mimic something
 that professional actors do for a living,
 it's usually really hit or miss.
 You know when you're in a church gathering,
 you're like, "Hey, let's play Who's Line Is It Anyway?"
 And you're like, "No, no, let's not.
 "Let's not humiliate ourselves."
 Because Who's Line Is It Anyways
 in National
  </li><li>This might be like that.
 But then when I looked at the list of people
 who signed up, you knew they were just gonna bring it.
 They were amazing.
  </li><li>Absolutely amazing.
  </li><li>And even had a Jeff,
 Jeff did a celebrity appearance in the,
 was awesome. - With Whitney Houston.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>And that's not correct.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Yeah, it was, I thought it was amazing.
 And then Lissy Rizzo provided her gluten-free chocolate.
 Where is the cake?
  </li><li>Do you see Rizzo?
  </li><li>What does she do?
 She's absolutely amazing.
 Well, I can hear our children outside do
 want some attention from mommy and daddy's.
 So, we're good parents.
 They haven't seen me all week.
 That's right.
 And they're going to love it.
 They were on vacation.
 But we did want to say between now and Friday the 4th of July,
 in honor of my birthday, we're going to be having 40% off all of our digital
 downloads on our website.
 So if you've been wanting to stock up on some of our teaching, this is the week to
 do it.
 We're knocking off 40% just use the code at checkout birthday, all lowercase.
 It's a birthday.
 Do you just need to enter in lowercase or one word birthday?
 It's lower.
 I didn't have to sing lowercase.
 I just drew it.
 I see what you did.
 That was very clever.
 Thank you.
 Okay.
 Alan and AJ.com birthday.
 We did it.
 Occasionally.
 You need hospitalization.
 Okay.
 Head to Alan and AJ.com.
 I'm going to go take some home, make Prozac.
  </li><li>And take 40% off.
 All right, we love you guys.
 We so enjoyed doing this podcast.
 Thank you for tuning in and listening.
 And you'll hear from us next week.
 Bye bye.
  </li><li>Bye.
  </li><li>And we're rolling.
  </li><li>Wait, we should do a whole podcast
 Or I just sound like Batman.
  </li><li>I'm Batman.
  </li><li>I'm Batman.
  </li><li>I'm Batman.
  </li><li>I am Batman.
  </li><li>No, I'm Batman.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Okay, maybe the idea won't work.
 All right, let's get this thing off.
  </li><li>Okay.
 [buzzing]
