<p> I live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Mr. Jones.<br/>
 Goodness gracious.<br/>
 You look hard today.<br/>
 Oh, thank you very much.<br/>
 Mm-hmm.<br/>
 Do you want to tell the people what you did slightly?
 Negligently before we started recording a podcast?
 OK, so I wasn't thinking.<br/>
 Well, I was thinking of other things.<br/>
 Basically, I just started a load of laundry because my workout clothes
 needed to be cleaned. And where is our laundry? Right above our heads. So if you hear the sound
 of rushing waters, it's not the Lord returning to speak deep to deep. Well, maybe it is, but it's
 more likely ages laundry. It's more likely my laundry. How's everyone? I hope you had a great week.
 What did we talk about last week? We talked about anger. Yeah. I hope you had a great angry week.
 A great angry week. Yeah, full of anger.
 Sounds weird. Yeah. Sounds weird. How was your week?
 Better than the previous week, but still plenty of challenges.
 I'm sky my brain for highlights of the week.
 I think most of my highlights had to do with food, just random salads.
 I made my Greek salad, which I hadn't made in a while, things like that.
 There was something exceptional about the Greek salad, do you remember?
 No, are you going for something specific?
 Something I did.<br/>
 I feel like it.<br/>
 Oh, you made the chicken?<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 We found a new recipe courtesy of Jeff Dollar, courtesy of Sam, the cooking
 guy on YouTube will put a link to this chicken recipe. And it was really good.
 Do we want a link to Sam, the cooking guy is in his language, a little foul?
 He's a little rough around the edges, but you're all grown ups and you know, how to
 use the sermon. But still, it's a great, great recipe.
 It is a good recipe. Yeah.<br/>
 That just makes me want to make it again. I'm not going to lie.
 So we are in the middle of a series on feelings.
 We have done five already.<br/>
 And we are about to talk about feeling number six.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah, this is all the work of Dr. Chip Dodd,
 and he's written a book called "The Voice of the Heart."
 Super helpful book.
 And also, he runs an organization called Seychil.
 We went into their training.
 We'd recommend both of them.
 If you haven't got the book,
 we'd really recommend you pick up the book
 or the audiobook, put a link in the show notes.
 But also, they are offering training that we did
 that was really, really excellent.
 And the reason I'm passionate, angry,
 about you all doing the training is,
 listening to this stuff isn't enough.
 Actually, when you go do the training,
 about half of it is like classroom time
 where you're getting some excellent world class teaching.
 The other half of it is where you're in process groups
 doing the work of the feelings.
  </li><li>Doing this stuff.
 I feel angry to itch my nose right now.
 What can I use that?
  </li><li>You can, I'll zoom in on you right now.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Oh, I feel so much better.
  </li><li>I love the way you lowered your lip.
 Does that stretch out your nose?
  </li><li>I don't know.
  </li><li>You love it.
 I love it when you watch it back because I'm going to zoom right in and 4k and it's going to look glorious.
 No, you know.
 You want me to cut it out?
 I don't know.
 You can do whatever you want.
 OK, I usually do.
 I know.
 So far, we've talked about four of the feelings.
 We've talked about her sad lonely fear.
 What's that?
 What's that?
 What's that?
 What did you think about?
 I just thought of something for fear.
 Go ahead.
 Wait, tell the people about your attempts to wrestle me.
 Cause that's a fun one.
 Okay.
 I, because I've been working out, I feel like I'm getting stronger.
 And so I should be able to pin you down by now, but I can't yet.
 But last week, was it last week that you shifted and hoofed me right off the bed
 onto the floor.
 Okay.
 Well, that sounds like the beginning of domestic abuse.
 Let's frame it in this proper gondack.
 So AJ is convinced that she can pin me down.
 So she literally tries to pin me down
 and doesn't realize that she's the easiest person to escape.
 And I also have like a hundred pounds on her.
 So she's very easy to, this is going to sound terrible.
 She's really easy to flip over and sit on.
 But at one point when she was pinning me
 for like the fifth or sixth time, I'm like, babe,
 this is a waste of time.
 And if you keep doing this, I'm going to throw you on the floor.
 And she's like, no, you're not.
 I'm super strong.
 You didn't say you were going to throw me on the floor.
 I thought I gave you fair warning.
 No, you did not.
 You did not remember.
 Did it in a different direction.
 All of a sudden I was like mid mid fall.
 I remember lowering, lowering you gently to the floor.
 Is that how you remember it?
 That is not how my rib cage.
 Remember, so all of ages, Google searches are all about
 craft Maga and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
 And she wants to learn how to pin me, which I'm loving, by the way.
 If you can help me out, if you know a viable way to.
 Now I'm scared that you're recruiting internet women ninja.
 -Well, I said to Abby today, I was like,
 "Mommy needs to figure out a way to pin down Daddy."
 And she goes, "Mommy, just hurt him."
 And I was like, "What do you mean?"
 -Thank 13-year-old.
 -She goes, "You know, like, so she's making suggestions
 of ways that I can hurt you, and then that way I'll win."
 And I was like, "Well, I don't want to hurt him."
 -Please send help.
 -I said, "Well, I don't want to hurt him.
 I just want to pin him down."
 And she goes, "But if you hurt him,
 you'll be able to pin him down.
 Our topic this week is about fear, which seems pertinent, given our topic of
 discussion.
 When I was thinking of earlier, okay, Ron.
 So today I heard Alan coming down the stairs and I knew he was coming and I
 was standing kind of, I knew he was looking for me.
 And so I squished up against the wall and waited for him to come around the
 corner and then I jumped out.
 Which doesn't seem very Christ-like.
 No, it is.
 Jesus told me to do.
 Spirit of deception.
 Come on.
 Okay, that's why.
 But it felt if I felt inspired to scare you.
 If I can't pin you, I'll scare you for now.
 Ooh, not have a bunch of ideas.
 Again, we're talking about fear this week, but before we jump into fear, let's do a quick recap on feelings.
 Why are feelings so important?
 Well, number one for me, God gave us feelings.
 Great answer.
 So, he obviously wanted feelings to be part of how we function.
 Yeah.
 And I think that was the biggest shift for me in terms of being willing to feel them is,
 "Okay, God, if you made me with these foreign things that I don't enjoy,
 okay, God, then I'm going to choose to start actually feeling them instead of ignoring them."
 Yeah, the other thing we've discovered is that on the pathway to full-hearted living like living the life that God's given us
 Feelings are this incredible gift from God. I don't think I ever knew that till starring this work
 I just thought feelings were a major inconvenience to you being productive, right?
 In fact, I remember one time singing with my therapist and he was like, what you know
 What do you know would start the session he'd show me the eight feelings like what are you feeling?
 I was like I'm so frustrated with this like well, like I'm not feeling anything
 And so he I said why don't you do the exercise?
 What are you feeling?
 And so he just lifts lifts off like six or seven feelings.
 I'm like you're feeling them all now.
 And he was like yeah, and I was revolved by I was like, oh my God,
 how do you even get anything done in this day?
 And he was like, wow, we've got some work to do now.
 But for full hearted living to be to be the way you're made to enjoy all that God's given you as a just feelings are essential.
 And what we've discovered as we've been doing these last couple of weeks is every feeling has a gift.
 That is, if you feel your feelings, if you process your feelings, if you talk about your feelings,
 if you explore your feelings, if you give your feelings to God, if you give the part of you that's
 angry, the part of you that's fearful, whatever, you invite the Lord into that, you have safe
 community as you explore your feelings, there is a tremendous gift with every feeling, and every
 gift is different for each feeling. But conversely, if you choose not to feel your feelings, then
 you end up with the impairments, which are all really things that we don't want,
 and would shout scripture versus that, but we don't realize we have them because we've partnered
 with shutting down our feelings. Right. And a lot of the impairments is an impaired way of living.
 Like it actually puts on the handbrake and the footbrake. Have you ever driven your car somewhere?
 And then you realize, why is this thing not working? And then you realize the footbrake is still in the car?
 I have. Yes. Quite a distance, I must do admit. Like the impairments a little bit like that
 We're like, we're going through life.
 It takes way more effort.
 There's tons of opposition.
 And that's the impairment because we are refusing to live
 the way we've been designed.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So this week we are talking about fear.
 And for a lot of us, we have been trained that fear
 equals weakness in that if we're experiencing fear,
 then we're obviously not like a people of faith.
  </li><li>Right.
 That whole thing where we don't want to admit that we're scared
 because it keeps us moving forward, isn't actually fear.
 It's the fear of fear.
 It's the fear of feeling our fear.
 Which now we've suddenly gone really meta.
  </li><li>Very meta.
 So when we become fearful about feeling fear,
 then we actually turn into really controlling people.
  </li><li>Right, 'cause we want guarantees
 that everything's gonna be okay,
 so we never have to feel any fear
 that could potentially come from doing this.
 And so we actually step back from living,
 we demand these guarantees,
 we become super controlling. And again, that's not the way we're designed. And it doesn't
 produce good fruit in relationships. If you doubt that, how many of you got really close
 friends who are super controlling and you love that part about their personality?
 Not me. And conversely, if we are actually going to admit that we feel fear, because let's face
 facts, there are some scary things in the world, the scary things about living life. If we admit
 that we're fearful, we actually step into reminding ourselves that we are human. We do have limitations.
 Just embracing that there's fear opens up the world of incredible fruitfulness to come into our lives.
 Yeah. I think fear makes you pay attention too.
 It absolutely does. If you think about when you back out of your driveway,
 you're reversing at your driveway, you're not like whistling and all cavalier.
 And I have no fear. I'm just going to gun it.
 No, you look over your shoulder or you look at if you got a newer car,
 you look at the rear view mirror and you're paying attention to what's happening.
 And that's actually one of the gifts of fear.
 It makes us aware of our surroundings.
 It makes us aware of potential danger in the area.
 And doing that actually leads to a gift we're going to talk about momentarily.
 So I'm trying to think, babe, it feels like fear is a prerequisite for trust.
 Like, you know, you have to actually feel your feelings in order to be able to enter
 into an agreement with the Lord to trust him about something.
 Yeah, usually trust is not required if we're able to do something in our own strength.
 Yeah.
 So if you think about all the times that we've done some of the Lord's
 asked us to do, move countries, move house, try something different.
 Yeah.
 There's inherent risk in all of that.
 Gosh, yes.
 And so the trust part comes with like, I am scared about doing that, but I trust
 you.
 Yeah.
 And my demonstration of my trust in you is partnering with my fear,
 acknowledging that it's there and recognizing that actually I can have
 confidence that you're in there and you get to the other side.
 Yes, that makes sense.
 And I think too often we try and eliminate fear.
 I don't know why.
 Like, I was, you know, well, not one to be human, not one to have limitations,
 because that's scary.
 And we try and demand and, but when we do that, we shrink our world.
 Like we only ever do things we know we can do.
 And that means we never ever grow.
 Yeah.
 The other thing is that fear leads us to joy and, and, and, and,
 based on what you were saying, like, when I have fear about something,
 And it's usually because of my own limitations.
 When I'm aware of my limitations, I identify my need.
 Like, I can't do this, or I don't know how to do this,
 or this is big, or this is scary.
 Think about, when we first moved here,
 we wanted to buy a house.
 We did not know how to buy a house at all.
 My parents didn't live in America.
 They knew nothing about, they bought some houses before.
 They lived in Great Britain.
 They didn't know what the American system was.
 Your mom is Canadian.
 Your dad is no longer with us.
 And so we feel like the Lord's asking us to buy a house,
 but we're scared, 'cause we don't know what to do.
 We don't know if we can afford it.
 We don't know the process.
  </li><li>How do you even figure it all out?
  </li><li>Right, and so that brings us to our need.
 Like we don't know what we're doing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>We need some help.
 And so we reached out to some dear friends of ours.
  </li><li>Well, the Lord highlighted to us.
  </li><li>Yeah, we prayed like Lord, we don't know what to do.
  </li><li>And he was like, meet with these people.
  </li><li>And so we go to meet these people.
 Who at that point, we didn't really know?
  </li><li>Not well, no.
  </li><li>So we took him out for dinner and asked him like,
 hey, here's what we feel that the Lord's asking us to do.
 We don't know how to do it.
 Would you help us in that process?
 Would you just guide us through?
  </li><li>Do you know anything about this?
  </li><li>Right, well actually, we knew that they had just
 helped their son by a house.
  </li><li>That's right.
  </li><li>Like walking through the process.
  </li><li>Yeah, so we're like, you know.
  </li><li>So we're like, you're a dad,
 you know how to walk people through this.
  </li><li>And they just sit there and go,
 do you know what we do?
 And we're like, no, we don't know what you do.
 They're like, I have a real estate license.
 So the Lord was setting us up.
 My point in that is there was tremendous joy
 in our weakness.
 Joy is often found when a tender response
 is shown to weakness.
 So we have weakness, we have need.
 These people are only too happy to help us.
 They feel joy in being able to give their gifts to people in need.
 We feel joy in being able to help.
 None of that process would have happened if we didn't first feel our fear.
 Right.
 So we feel our fear and that actually leads us to go and pursue wisdom.
 Oh, look at AJ Jones just jumping ahead.
 Yep.
 Yeah.
 I'm jumping ahead, Billy.
 That's right.
 The gift of fear is wisdom.
 And here's how that works.
 You already heard an example of one type of fear is that you sit in a situation, you
 realize you don't know what you're doing, you don't know what you've reached your limitations
 which identifies your needs.
 I need help.
 You reach out for help and just that understanding that you're in need opens you up to be teachable
 and you reach out for help.
 Another example of that would be if you are in a new situation, a new environment and perhaps
 you sense danger around you, you're feeling fearful about the situation, you're feeling
 and fearful about people, it causes you to be heightened awareness about your environment,
 about the people, maybe causes you to take some precautions. That's wisdom in action.
 And actually what's interesting about that is when we feel fear in those situations,
 it's actually speaking about our internal worth.
 Wow.
 I'm in danger and I am worth protecting. Therefore, I will take precautions to keep me safe,
 attributing value to ourselves.
 Good.
 Another gift of fear.
 Very cool.
 You were talking earlier about how God made us this way.
 Think about your physiological reactions to fear.
 So let's say you're walking away.
 You mean your fight or flight?
 Yeah, your fight flight mechanism.
 Yeah.
 But you're in a situation where you feel like
 you're physically in danger, what happens to you physically?
 You start to walk faster.
 Your heart raises.
 Yeah.
 And so what's happening is your body's telling you,
 I'm in danger, you pay attention to that.
 And again, wisdom comes out with that.
 I need to call somebody.
 I need to change lanes and go to a police station,
 whatever you need to do to take care of yourself.
 So we talked a little bit about discernment.
 Like you're aware that something's not quite right.
 Like you're aware that and your fear speaks to you,
 like, hey, something's not quite right,
 which leads to discernment.
 You listen to that voice, leads to wisdom
 and finding what you need.
 What is the difference then between discernment and judgment?
  </li><li>The best definition that I have heard of judgment
 comes from the Kaelstra's from Betsy and Chester.
  </li><li>Our dear friends, Chester and Betsy Kaelstra,
 who are adorable and--
  </li><li>Wonderful.
  </li><li>Vicious, I was gonna say, but they are wonderful, yeah.
  </li><li>They're vicious in the best sort of way.
  </li><li>Yeah, but vicious like a skilled surgeon.
  </li><li>Yes, precise.
 Anyway, they say a judgment sounds like an observation
 with attitude.
 So it's not just noticing a thing or being aware of a thing
 and then doing whatever you need to do with it
 to be safe or whatever, but it's actually then going past that
 and adding attitude and like motive probably.
  </li><li>Or scribing motive to somebody.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, I love that description from Chester and Betsy.
 Chip describes judgment as an attempt at stopping fear
 without having to listen to your fear.
 So we just move straight to judgment
 so we can eradicate all of their perspective.
  </li><li>This is actually all about them and you know whatever.
  </li><li>And remove ourselves from it.
  </li><li>Right, wow.
  </li><li>We were talking about this earlier,
 you know with the example of buying a house.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But one of the other beautiful things about fear
 is it helps us see our limitations.
 Like when we often, when we're fearful,
 we've run out of us and we need something more
 and that's scary.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Because if you need something more,
 it means you're gonna have to rely on something other than you.
  </li><li>God.
  </li><li>We don't like that at other people.
  </li><li>Oh, yeah.
  </li><li>So fear actually lets you know your limitations,
 which brings a gift of allowing other people
 to meet your needs.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So when we see our limitations,
 we actually come into an understanding
 that we need other people and we need their help.
 Okay, so real time example, story about the podcast.
 We'd been podcasting for, I don't know, four or five years,
 but we only ever did audio podcasting.
 And when we started, we didn't have a clue what we're doing.
 We had a really good friend Blake Stratton,
 who'd podcasted before.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And it was fun.
 He came over, showed us how to use microphones,
 how to set them up, how to plug them in the computer,
 all that sort of stuff.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And what do you know,
 doing the same thing over and over again,
 every week you get better and better at it.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But I had this itching in my heart to do video.
 The trouble is, I don't know anything about video.
 Like I know enough to be dangerous.
 And so, you know, we set up a camera,
 we hooked everything up and it was just dreadful
 because video is so freaking hard.
  </li><li>It's really hard. - So difficult.
 And so I like to be able to figure things out myself.
 I'm a bit of a nerd.
 I wanna do research, but all of my research,
 all of my abilities left me with a need
 that like, I can't get this good.
 I can't get this working.
 And so over the years,
 we've had many people help us with the podcast.
 So Cooper built this,
 basically our stage set right here,
 that back wall. He came and helped us with that. Chris Law came and helped us with our lighting.
 But most recently, and this is the beauty of the pandemic, the pandemic seemed like this global
 equalizer for everybody, like it reset perfectionism for everybody. So you've got like these talk
 show hosts who are used to recording from multi-million dollar studios who are currently unable to go
 to work but want to stay on the air. And so you've got these experts who are reduced to using an
 iPhone camera and a selfie stick hosting their shows. And it's so funny watching everybody get
 better and better and better. But for me, what it did was it kind of motivated me to go,
 so I'll admit I was fearful about putting out bad stuff. Like not bad content, but bad delivery.
 Like I want it to be good. I have fear that it's not going to be good. I want to serve you really,
 really well. And so we start up podcasting again, video podcasting, and I realize I just can't get
 this to work. And I remember one night, it was kind of late at night and I'm thinking, "Lord,
 I've tried everything. I don't know what to do and I'm thinking and I'm feeling sad that it's taking me this long
 I haven't got anywhere. I'm feeling lonely because I you know you can't help. I'm sorry. I can't. Yeah, what the heck
 And I'm feeling fear that the deadline's coming. I'm not gonna get something out
 And then I remember actually my fear leads me to understand my limitations
 And so I call one of my friends. I just texted my friend Trent and said Trent
 Is there any way you could help me color correct video?
 Now, if you know nothing about video, color correction is taking a video and people have
 got superhuman strength.
 They're like, oh, there's too much blue in that.
 There's too much cyan in that.
 And I'm like, I don't know what you're talking about.
 I don't see any of it.
 I don't see any of it.
 But trying to be happy to.
 And so, you know, Trent remotely takes over my computer and he starts color correcting
 things and it looks good because Trent gave us all that help.
 But that was an example of like my limitations is producing fear and actually I'm trying
 back away from my fear. I have fear about reaching out to
 Trent. I don't want to bother him. It's late on a Saturday night.
 Maybe he's too busy. Maybe I'll be rejected. Maybe I'll reach
 out for help and be denied. And then I'll be in a worse
 situation than I was before. Because now not only can I do it,
 but like I've been denied, I've been rejected. Yadda yadda yadda.
 But the gift of sitting in my fear really realizing my need
 and reaching out for help again, produce that joy. I was
 talking about a trend tender response to my weakness.
 Blast me and blast him.
 Yeah.
 I hope it blessed you, Trent.
 We hope.
 Trent, we're just assuming.
 Yeah.
 You, well, you kept telling me, no, I love doing this.
 This is great.
 So I took you at your word chip in his book, Voice of the Heart, says this, healthy
 fear leads me into relationship because it helps me recognize that I am not enough.
 Oh, amen.
 Oh, we don't like that though, do we?
 I need others.
 I need others who have skills different from my own.
 Fear allows me to be willing to listen to the wisdom of others and acknowledge their talents.
 And that's so true, isn't it?
 Like there is a certain joy in being able to help people you love with the things that you can do that they can.
 I love it.
 Yeah, I don't mean from my like, "Ha ha ha ha!"
 But there is, it's beautiful being a flax of stuff that is second nature to you and realize it's a gift to people.
 Now, ironically, we talked about our friends who helped us in the first, you know, walking
 us through a process of how to buy a house, where to get loans, all that sort of stuff.
 Which in itself was an amazing God story.
 Don't have time to go into that.
 But what do you know a couple of years later, we developed this rich, rich relationship
 with this beautiful, beautiful couple.
 And I discover that all of my nerdy stuff that I just take for granted that...
 They need the nerd.
 That doesn't feel like work or doesn't feel like stuff I've acquired through study is
 just innate to me, actually becomes a huge blessing to them.
 Yeah.
 So, you know, forever, I'm like fixing Wi-Fi or resetting passwords.
 And for me, it's like, oh, it's trivial, but to them, it's like, oh, my gosh,
 you just saved our life.
 And I'm like, not really.
 But this give and take of understanding we all have limitations and works,
 life works better in community is a glorious thing.
 Yeah.
 So basically knowing our limitations is actually gift.
 Yeah.
 So when we know we're needy, then we can receive the blessing.
 Right.
 And that's the beauty of community.
 And if there's no shame,
 we're gonna talk about shame soon,
 about like being needy, about being human,
 about having limitations, beautiful things come.
 Do you remember that time that I was having a really hard time
 because we had like someone wrong with our toilet,
 I don't know how to fix it.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And you and your kindness said--
  </li><li>I think I said something like,
 babe, you're a great preacher, you're a great teacher.
 Like there's things that you're trained to do.
 Plumbers are trained to plumb.
 They probably don't wanna preach.
 and you don't need to be a plumber.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was beautiful in that you were just like,
 "Hey, the plumber is not less of a use to God
 "because he can't preach,
 "and you're not less useful to God and me and the family
 "because you don't have a plumb."
 Like just stick to your gifts, stick to your lanes.
 I was like, "Actually, that's a huge relief, thank you."
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I was thinking about that whole thing
 about being in communities, wonderful,
 'cause everybody's got gifts.
 But here's the thing, if you refuse to feel your fear,
 you'll never know your needs.
 You'll never know your limitations.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>So you'll never be open to receiving help.
 Which means you won't be teachable.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Which means you can't receive the blessings
 that your community is able to offer you.
  </li><li>So that just makes me think,
 'cause we talk so much on the school
 and when we teach and stuff about being teachable
 and about how important it is to remain teachable,
 especially in a role of leadership or anything like that.
 So if what you're saying is true,
 then actually we need to feel our fear to stay teachable.
 That's an interesting key, isn't it?
 Because sometimes I wonder,
 "Oh, why don't I want to be teachable in this right now?
 "And I wonder if it's more,
 "Oh, I don't want to feel my fear or my insecurities
 "about not being enough in this."
 And so that's why I'm not teachable
 is because I'm refusing to feel the,
 "I'm not enough, I have fear, I need others,
 "I need someone else."
  </li><li>I think you start talking about that
 and I thought about my first day at group therapy.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And I thought about the tremendous fear I felt
 about walking into an unknown part of a building
 into a room with unknown men
 to do something I'd never done before,
 not knowing what I'm doing,
 not knowing how to do it right,
 not knowing what the rules are so I can ace this thing,
 like having tremendous fear around that
 and realizing if I did not embrace that fear
 and the humility that comes from the fear of like,
 I don't know what I'm doing and I don't know how to do this
 and I don't know how to impress you
 and I don't know what the rules are.
 So I don't know how to ace it.
 I would never have experienced all the transformation
 I've received.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Like if I didn't want to embrace my fear
 and I'm like, group therapy, that's just for losers.
 Like who would want to go to group therapy?
 Which was my initial thought.
  </li><li>So basically if you'd listen to me.
  </li><li>I'm not saying that.
 Like I had enough of my own internal fear going,
 I don't want to do group,
 I mean, I remember coming home.
 I don't think I helped though.
 I was like, "Group therapy, are you joking?"
 But the beauty that whole thing of like, you know, you humble yourself before the Lord
 and you lift you up and do time.
 Yeah.
 I feel like from doing group therapy, I have found this pot of treasure that was hidden
 and I didn't know I wanted.
 Yeah.
 And I just think it was on the other side of humility, i.e. on the other side of fear.
 Like, I did not want to go, but I've been pestering my therapist for a year.
 Like, "Why am I even paying you money?"
 like, this is getting us nowhere.
 As in, I'm refusing to submit,
 I'm refusing to learn from you.
 I'm refusing every week you're saying
 you need to feel your feelings.
 I'm like, feelings, what, pile of nonsense.
 In, you know, being brought to the end of myself
 and realizing I need something other
 than what I already have.
 In recognizing actually there's probably treasure
 in what I previously disdained.
 I actually got just a wealth.
 And I love it for me.
 I love what I got for me.
 but I also love that people in my community
 are getting more because as a leader in the community,
 like what's on your life trickles down?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So I love it.
  </li><li>Well, it's not just your community, it's in our house.
  </li><li>Yeah, like, yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, I don't like to talk about my kids
 without their permission,
 but I just had so many tender moments this week
 with my kids choosing to be vulnerable
 and share their feelings.
 And again, we don't mandate that they like pick a feeling
 from like a list of eight.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>But they're very, very fluent.
 And I love that.
 I love that that's a byproduct of doing this work.
 So this paradox that we find in discussing our fear
 that in, for example, our weakness begins our strength.
 Like finding that we're weak
 and realizing our limitations leads to the blessing
 of strength of other people helping us.
 The other paradox being that in our fear,
 we find wisdom is all perfectly biblical.
  </li><li>Yes.
 And I love that.
 Like Proverbs chapter nine, verse 10,
 says, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom."
 Which we, you know, like we just think about that
 as cross-stitched on a pillowcase
 or a great bumper sticker or a fridge magnet.
 But actually there's a truth in that.
 That, you know, that whole thing about
 do not lean on your own understanding
 but in all your ways acknowledge the Lord.
 Like are you kidding me?
 I paid a lot of money for my understanding.
 You know, like I have advanced degrees.
 Like I wanna-- - Expensive understanding.
  </li><li>I wanna lean on that and the Lord's just like,
  </li><li>Yeah, that's only gonna get you so far.
 I love what Graham Cook says,
 that God's much too clever to be an intellectual.
 All right, now again, nothing against intellectuals,
 but logic and reasoning will only take you so far.
 And that's where trust begins in order to trust.
 You have to like feel your fear and accept,
 okay God, I'm counting the cost as I step out.
  </li><li>Yeah, so let's talk a little bit about the impairment.
  </li><li>Right, the impairment comes when we don't want to feel
 our fear. - Yes, which is usually the deal.
  </li><li>Yeah, and it makes sense why.
 Feeling your fear is scary.
 Why would you want to do that?
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>Well, the reason you want to do that
 is if you don't feel your fear,
 the impairment is anxiety.
 Nobody wants to be anxious.
 And anxiety comes about because basically,
 in refusing to feel your fear,
 you're just like, I don't want what you're offering.
 I would just rather stay in control.
 And by staying in control,
 it means we get to stay away from the understanding
 that we have limitations.
 So it's this great illusion,
 this great denial that I have limitations
 And if I can actually just control everything,
 control my environment, control the circumstances,
 control what's happening, find a guidebook,
 ace it, I will be fine and I will not have limitations,
 therefore I don't need to have fear.
 Could imagine there's a few problems with that one.
  </li><li>There's a lot of problems with that, yep.
 So in our impaired state, what fear tells us
 is that we are gonna be found out for who we really are.
  </li><li>Right, not enough.
  </li><li>And then all of our fears are just gonna like.
  </li><li>And we'll never get the help we need.
 So even if we do reach out, it's not gonna be met.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Which then reinforces the lie
 that I just have to do everything myself
 'cause my needs are never gonna be mad, I'm all alone.
 We talk about this a lot when we talk about
 the shame, fear, control cycle, that's stronghold.
 And we'll unpack that a little bit
 when we get to the teaching and shame.
  </li><li>So instead of using fear to acknowledge the circumstance
 and feel our feelings and then reach out and say,
 "We need help."
 We actually start to scramble to try
 and control the situation instead.
  </li><li>Which of course we can,
 which just leads to this anxiety feeling.
  </li><li>Anxious people are controlling people,
 and they're basically trying to get their needs met
 without having to feel their fear.
  </li><li>Yes, talking about anxiety, Chip says this,
 "In anxiety, we rob ourselves of daily living
 and its experience.
 Instead, we try to control our future
 in order to prevent the reoccurrence
 of painful past experiences."
  </li><li>Ow.
  </li><li>Yeah, thanks Chip.
  </li><li>Anxiety is basically self-sufficiency,
 and if you take self-sufficiency
 to its logical conclusion, you don't need to save your.
  </li><li>Ouch. - Sorry about that.
 You know, it's ironic 'cause anxious people
 would rather be miserable than needy.
  </li><li>Yes, I think so.
  </li><li>Here's the crazy thing, right?
 If I'm gonna refuse to feel my fear,
 I'm gonna become really anxious, super controlling,
 and instead of asking for help,
 because I'm scared that nobody's actually gonna come
 to my help, instead I'm gonna recruit people
 to help soothe my anxiety away.
 And if you've ever been sat with an anxious people,
 they don't want help.
 They just want somebody to sit with them and--
  </li><li>And agree.
  </li><li>And justify that they've got a right to be anxious.
 They don't want a solution.
 They don't want to get out because they don't have to feel
 or face reality.
 They just want to stay in their anxiety and say,
 "Hey, please," which also leads to self-pity,
 leads to victimhood.
 And it's just that, I mean, that's what we talk about
 when we're talking about living with an impairment.
 Like the quality of life you live is way, way low.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So, babe, if I'm sitting here and I'm hearing this
 and I'm realizing, oh gosh, that's me.
 I'm an anxious person.
 Then you can kind of flip the process backwards, right?
 And go, oh, I'm living this anxious lifestyle
 that you're talking about.
 I'm aware that that's me.
 So what I need to do actually is feel my fear.
  </li><li>Yeah, start thinking about what am I afraid of?
 Maybe write it down.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>A good way of knowing if you're living
 in the impairment of fear is if you always have to have
 a bad guy to blame your problems on.
 (laughing)
 All right, so if it's all with somebody else's fault,
 if it's the government, if it's Facebook,
 if it's your teachers, if it's the police,
 if it's the leaders, if you have a bad guy,
 you've made move from taking responsibility
 for the quality of life you're living
 into this kind of anxiety and externalize it.
 It's their fault, ah, and that allows you
 to not have any limitations, it can't be your problem.
 And a good way of looking at it is just journey
 through your past, and if you're the common denominator
 between all of your bad guys, it's probably not them,
 It's probably some part of your heart
 not wanting to feel your feelings.
  </li><li>Right, so we're not talking about
 like separate small situations
 where there is maybe a legit bad guy.
 We're talking about a lifestyle of where we're going.
 Everybody around me, those are all the bad guys.
 Like that's the common denominator.
  </li><li>Yeah, no matter which skill you went to,
 like if you've moved,
 geography will not excuse your need to feel feelings.
 So if you move to a new church, a new job, a new city,
 And the same problems keep cropping up.
 I would pay attention to that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>We're just full of good news and happy news today.
  </li><li>Sorry about that.
 But fear keeps on giving.
 It's not just anxiety that we end up with.
  </li><li>Yeah, we talked about this last week,
 the other impairment, this is like two for one.
 Not only do you end up in anxiety,
 but more than likely,
 another option of your impairment
 is you're gonna end up in rage.
  </li><li>Yeah, rage comes from refusing to face
 that we are vulnerable people.
 Whereas anxieties attempt to not feel fear
 is to say, I have no limitations and everything's okay.
 Rage's attempt is to scare away that which is scaring them.
 Like, I'll get big, I'll get loud, I'll get,
 rah, to scare away the thing that is scaring me.
 Rageful people are just terrifying
 of exposing their hearts.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So do you think we can say, and I'm asking,
 can we say that insecurity is fear that produces rage?
 'cause it seems like many of the people
 that I've encountered, including in my own family,
 that would rage at the bottom of that
 is some level of insecurity that they're trying to push away.
  </li><li>That's not a great question for Chip,
 'cause I've also met people who are insecure
 and that insecurities manifest in a different way.
 Rage is an attempt to deny that fear even exists.
 Like look how big I am, I couldn't possibly be scared.
 We talked about rage a little bit last week.
 When we're talking about anger, we talked about you grew up in what we thought was an
 angry household.
 Yes.
 But it was actually a rage filled household.
 Sure.
 Talk to me about the difference between rage and anger.
 Well, I think they're actually miles apart.
 Rage denies that we are human and needy.
 Right.
 And anger actually embraces that we are needy.
 Chip says in his book that rage rejects the fear of desire.
 Wow.
 Whereas anger provides the passion to move us towards the desires.
 They're actually like polar opposite on on on other ends of the scale
 So that's our fifth feeling fear leads us to ask like what am I afraid of like what's behind my fear?
 What am I worried is gonna happen and the gift of feeling fear is wisdom where the impairment is
 Anxiety and rage so they go who knew that feeling fear was a positive thing
 Yep, it's a gift
 Hey, if you want the show notes for this week and go to Allen and AJ calm
 And we want to thank all of our patrons who help us make this show happen.
 If you would like to become a patron, you can go to alanaj.com/patreon.
 And if all this stuff is waking up passion in your heart to know more about how you're
 made, how you're built, how to interact with other people, we have an amazing school at
 the church we help pastor called the School of Supernatural Life.
 To give you an idea of the school and what it's like, we're going to just play a short
 clip for you and then we'll be back straight after that.
 When I came here, I was just blown away by the level of relationship that people had with
 God and it changed everything for me.
 Getting to set aside eight months of my life to run after the Lord and be surrounded by
 a group of people that were doing the same thing was absolutely incredible.
 My life before the school was, I had all this stuff going on in my heart and people would
 always tell me, "Just let Jesus' feet."
 My question was always, "How?"
 I did not have any hope, any joy, any love in my heart.
 I was very close off to the world and was very selfish.
 I would say the school really flipped my world upside down.
 Now I constantly am thankful. I'm constantly living in a place of gratitude and freedom.
 My mind's not racing. I'm not constantly worried about finances or anything like that.
 I just know that God's with me.
 I had really battled depression for ten years.
 Seeing God come through and just miraculously healing me of depression.
 was truly impactful.
 So literally, it changed my life.
 (laughs)
 I can honestly say that.
  </li><li>The most impactful thing about being at the school
 was that all the leaders,
 they didn't necessarily show me how to lay all my burdens
 down to Jesus' feet.
 And they didn't tell me,
 they basically just took my hand in and walked with me.
 And until I met Jesus face to face,
 and then they would stand back
 and just watch you have this Jesus encounter week after week.
  </li><li>There wasn't one particular week
 stood out to me as the whole world, my whole life changed, but I left the school a completely
 different person.
 The school creates space for you to actually encounter God, and you know, you can hear
 the teachings, bang bang bang, you hear, "Oh, he's a good father. He loves you all these things,
 but actually the school created space for me to encounter the father that they teach about it."
 In the school, we learned how to hear the voice of God, and after that we got to learn how to
 prophesy, which is just to repeat his love over the people that are in our path.
 What I loved about all of the classes was that there was an opportunity for application,
 And so it was within a day, maybe two days after a teaching
 that I would have an opportunity to actually apply
 the principles or the teachings
 that I had heard through the class.
  </li><li>It was super cool to go on outreach
 and be able to practice everything
 that you were learning in the school
 and get to tangibly see things happen.
 I remember we went to South Africa
 and we got to go pray in this local kind of pub/village area
 and everyone we prayed for got healed.
  </li><li>The school completely changed my life.
  </li><li>The school of supernatural life changed my life forever.
  </li><li>Has my life changed?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>My life is completely different because of that so as so.
  </li><li>The school has totally changed my life.
  </li><li>My life is changed because of going to the school.
  </li><li>God will use your yes.
 And so if he's inviting you to do the school,
 he's not gonna leave you hanging.
 Like he's gonna transform you.
  </li><li>I would just really encourage anyone,
 no matter how old you are, whether you're young or you're my age or even older, to just
 really know that God has so much more ahead for you.
 And going to the school is one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life.
 And I will say to you that if you give it eight months, you will not regret it.
 I'm a living testament that it doesn't matter how much time you've had with the Lord.
 If you give him a week, if you give him your entire week, he will change your life.
 So especially if you give them an eighth month time, your whole life is just going to be radically changed.
 If you're interested in this school, you can head on over to the website.
 Applications are open until June 15th.
 But for now, thanks for being with us.
 We've loved being with you.
 If this has been helpful for you, just go ahead and share the podcast with someone
 else who might find it helpful.
