<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Hello!
 (laughing)
 I can't remember how we do this.
 Welcome!
  </li><li>Oh my God.
 Episode 255 of Keeping Up With The Joneses, I'm Alan.
  </li><li>I'm AJ.
  </li><li>And this is how it started already.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Give me a quick catch up on this week.
 bearing in mind that we recorded the last episode four days ago.
 So technically a week has not passed.
 Oh, a lot has happened in one week.
 Yes.
 Uh, you know, just life is busy.
 It's so busy.
 That's what you're leading with.
 Well, I actually, I tried a new restaurant.
 I got to go out and celebrate a friend.
 I think we're overlooking the fact here that I managed to email all of our
 staff about looking for a new counselor thinking I was emailing a new counselor.
 We're going to get a speaker come to Grace Center and speak to our staff.
 And I was really impressed by him.
 And I'm looking for a new therapist because I haven't seen one in a year.
 And good Lord, you need to see a therapist.
 Yeah.
 And so I've been asked around for recommendations and I knew he was coming.
 So I thought, I want to wait and see what this guy's like.
 And I quite liked him.
 So thinking I was emailing him.
 And only him.
 And only him.
 I actually managed to email my whole.
 The entire staff.
 The entire staff.
 So I quickly followed up with, well, there's me modeling.
 asking for help, you know, and how not to you reply all the way up.
 So for some other reason, that stands out as a notable thing from this week.
 But no, go on. Tell me about your restaurant.
 I went to it's called Ros&Atilde;&copy; Pony and it's up.
 I don't even know what that area is called.
 Highway 100, a bell meatish kind of way all kinds, but it's, it's, you know,
 know, it's sort of farm to table type food. I really liked it. The food was so good.
 And I got to have just a nice time hanging out with some girlfriends. So it was really
 good.
 I didn't hang out with any of my girlfriends this week. Yeah, that's probably good. I gave
 up girlfriends for when I picked one.
 Oh, thanks, darling.
 You were teaching. Actually, we were both teaching. In fact, almost all of our staff
 were teaching.
 Yeah.
 Healing Life Hearts Week.
 And then I've been teaching the prophetic class on Wednesday nights for the last seven weeks. So that's been
 You know going and today though, I had no planned meetings for the first time in months
 I know I left and I came back and you just powered through I just got to check so many things off my list
 Oh, it was a good feeling. I love it. I gotta have lunch with David Ryan on this week
 I'm a favorite sushi place. I mean, how do you beat that?
 Friends and sushi you email the whole staff
 Oh, kindness challenge. I was thinking like so last week we recorded this episode. Yeah, no
 Wonder we was it last week two weeks ago? We released an episode about kindness challenge
 and
 I was thinking like we're supposed to
 Opposed but I always feel bad about like hey here's a post of me being kind to someone right, but I
 Also want to talk about it, but also I want to talk about being on receiving in
 Friends of yours
 No friends of ours to send you home with some
 Smoke brisket that was really good. It's my favorite food. Oh, it's so good. I just had some for lunch as well
 How have you been manifesting your how have you been manifesting your potato monkey challenge?
 The potato monkey challenge or the kindness challenge
 mostly
 paying for food for random people
 Interestingly, I don't know whether it's just because we've been in restaurants a lot. I've
 I've most of my kindness has been challenged to our food servers.
 Okay, like just tipping really well.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And then while also paying for other people's meals, like, yeah, that's always a fun surprise.
 Yeah.
 I couldn't resist yesterday.
 I saw the cutest lady else sitting by herself.
 This is the between AJ and I, AJ and I walk into a restaurant.
 And as the hostess is taking us to our table, we walk past this lady and I look at what she's eating.
 And I almost take some of the food off her plate because it looks so good to eat it.
 And I comment to the host, oh, I nearly took some food off her plate.
 Meanwhile, AJ says to the server, is there any way you could pay for that woman's meal?
 We had completely different thoughts.
 You wanted to bless her, I wanted to steal from her.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, we've balanced each other.
 How long do I know?
 I'm here to help modify your behavior.
 Yeah.
 I do a very poor job.
 And I'm trying to think of anything else.
 I don't think you miss her kids have said.
 Tia made some sort of reference to on Wednesday night
 We're driving home and I said hey Abby can you cuz she's got her phone hooked up so she can play her music
 So I said could you text daddy and get daddy to run the bath?
 And then she said daddy texts back and said he's not gonna do it because of something you've done and I sent back and said
 I didn't do that and Tia goes tell him and I can't remember what she said and I said
 That is not the way to get a bath run like you have to actually use kindness
 And she goes oh do tell me about your course and manipulation
 Hold my
 I can make it I can feel it. It's on its way, but if she finishes the bunch on the story
 I'll be a sneaky sprawl for the end
 Chris can cut and nobody needs to see that. Oh my gosh everybody needs to see that that was so funny
 He hasn't left my head. Oh, well, I usually sneeze in twos and threes
 So do you want to just like see what I think about your nose?
 So Tia was
 Yeah, so she asked me when I was going to give her a course and I forget whether she said how to manipulate your husband or something.
 And I was like, I'm not manipulating.
 I'm being kind.
 Manipulation is something completely different.
 In other news, yes, we have started rewatching.
 Go ahead and answer.
 Other Westwind.
 Oh, I love the way we started with season two because historically season one was filmed in four, three aspect.
 So we're missing all of these great shows.
 Yeah, but we've seen how many times we watched the west.
 I mean, a couple of times, but there's such there's so many of the first season that
 are really.
 This is the point starting with season two episodes one and two.
 Yeah, that was great.
 I mean, I was in tears the whole time.
 You were.
 I'm going to say, but it's to be said that while we're watching it, you are still playing
 a game on your phone the whole time.
 Yeah, but I wasn't in tears right with the game.
 Moving little bubbles around or little numbers.
 I'm sorry.
 Two dots woman is my game not sophisticated enough for you.
 No, it isn't mine.
  </li><li>I'm on one.
  </li><li>Well, because it's written by Aaron Sorkin,
 it's all the, you know, wicked banter
 and the witty dialogue that's going back and forth
 and that, you know, it's, oh, it's so good.
 If you haven't watched The West Wing,
 I maintain it's the best TV show ever made.
  </li><li>I love it, I love it.
 Yeah, so we're back watching that, which is, it's fun.
 It kind of feels like we're sitting down
 with an old friend, you know, so I'm quite excited.
  </li><li>Well, our history with it, it started 14 years ago.
 It didn't start 14 years ago,
 But our relationship with the start 14 years ago,
 was when we had our first child.
 You had our first child.
  </li><li>We bought the box set.
  </li><li>Well, somebody gave us some advice.
 If you're gonna nurse, you may as well watch, you know,
 box sets, this was before Netflix.
 It's pre-dates, streaming services.
 So I went on eBay and bought all seven seasons,
 was it seven?
  </li><li>Yeah, it's.
  </li><li>In a deck of two.
  </li><li>Seven, right? I can't remember.
 It's in a decorative box, pretty.
  </li><li>Yep, and we fell in love with it and watched it.
 Like Abigail walked in and said, "What's this about?"
 And I was like, I said,
 If I say it's about American politics, you know, you're going to yawn and turn off.
 And it really isn't.
 It's about the relationships and the rich, intertwined narratives of brilliant human beings
 set against the backdrop.
 But they could be a PE department.
 They could be a bunch of librarians.
 Sure.
 The context within which it said, doesn't it?
 And that's kind of the kind of stuff that Aaron Sorkin writes.
 I mean, it's that's his MO.
 Oh, but such.
 But Jeff Bartlett for president.
 Well, I was thinking, Lord, isn't it bizarre that I want to live in a fictitious environment?
 Yeah.
 Rather than our president.
 Also, it introduced me to American politics.
 I didn't know anything.
 We were watching in Canada.
 I do sometimes think back to things I learned by watching that show and it helps me.
 All right.
 Our topic for this week is.
 You drum rolling?
 Yeah, ready.
 You're on then.
 How to keep going.
 It's it I didn't mean it to be a follow on from last week's episode about how deal with discouragement, but I had a dream this week.
 Yes.
 I'm like, why are you still stopping my hands?
 You think I'm going to start redram?
 I know you.
 Most predictable woman on the planet.
 I had a dream this week where I as I just most before I woke up, I had a dream and I heard an audible voice quote to me.
 I think it's Hebrews 12, where it says,
 "For the joy set before him, he endured the cross."
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And then I hear the same voice ask me,
 "Do you know what your cross is?
 Do you know what your joy is?"
 And then I woke up.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>I know, what a way to start my day.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So, as I'm sitting kind of slightly bewildered,
 thinking about that dream, just going,
 "Wow, that was a really pointed dream."
 I remember when Alex Seeley from the belonging
 came and taught on our school.
 And she made a statement, which I've heard other people say, but Alex was the first person I heard to say it.
 So I'm a tribunally quote to her is that vision gives pain a purpose.
 As in the joy set before Jesus was what helped him endure the cross.
 And, you know, if you listened to last week, we were talking about how do you deal with discouragement
 and the importance of having something joyful that gets you through the difficult season.
 Yeah.
 So I was thinking, but because I have no experience with this, I would throw it to you
 being pregnant at times didn't look that joyful. Didn't look that comfortable. Was it all the
 vomiting and lack of sleep? We're throwing up in 18 different nations in the space of a vote.
 We don't want to over exaggerate. It was only nine different nations in a period of eight weeks.
 Okay. Yeah. It didn't look good, but something kept you going.
 Well, I mean, exactly. I mean, that's a great analogy. You know, in the end, there's going to be this
 baby. And so whatever the next nine months looks like really, it's 10 months, because it's 40 weeks,
 but let's not get into that. You know, you know that there's an end result. I mean, even when you're
  </li><li>Wait, how? - In the process of first. - Let's keep it into it. Why do they call it nine months
 when it is? I just did the math in my head. - I know idea. - Yeah. Well, not every month is
 four weeks in it. So is that why? - You know what? I don't really know. It's either way,
 It's still 40 weeks.
 So if most months are four weeks.
 I get the math.
 You don't get to find that part to me.
 Yeah.
 But from the way they count it, you actually
 get pregnant two weeks into the first month.
 Usually.
 Anyway, don't worry about it.
 So anyway, the thought of having a baby
 kept you going.
 Yeah.
 And even when you're actually in labor,
 it's like, yes, this is horrible.
 But the end result is going to be I finally have this tiny human.
 So, and that's probably also why you forget how horrible it was and decide to
 get pregnant again.
 Yes.
 Sorry.
 Yeah.
 Did you get like a flood of endorphins once you've actually pushed the baby out?
 Sorry.
 This is way too graphic.
 Like not that I remember.
 I got a flood of stitches.
 Does that count?
 Okay.
 That example.
 Think joy, think joy.
 Right.
 Joy.
 Joy.
 Yeah.
 I mean, the closest example, I've got this is not I shouldn't take closest example.
 I've got no close.
 Because unless you've given birth to a watermelon, I have not.
 I have not.
 One of the examples I could think of was that season of life where we were going
 through buying a house, moving a house and completing our green card paperwork
 and having a baby.
 We had MG rated the you remember that.
  </li><li>So you were dealing with, like I literally remember saying to you.
  </li><li>Which is awful.
  </li><li>Which, oh I repent of.
 But at the time, like I had no chip dot in my life, I didn't know anything better.
 But I remember coming to you and you're pregnant.
 And I remember saying, babe, the only way I can make it through this season
 is to not be available for your emotional needs.
 I just have to shut down my heart so I can get through this.
 Do you remember this? - Yes.
  </li><li>All right. - Oh, I remember.
 I'm like, oh, it's good that I'm not about to give birth any time now.
 Never mind, I shouldn't need any emotional support.
 I'm sure we'll all be fine.
  </li><li>Why, man, I give you heads up.
 I sent you a memo.
  </li><li>I let you know I wasn't gonna be available.
  </li><li>I just like to apologize.
  </li><li>Hang on, I just wanna make a note
 so that when I'm talking to my account,
 so I can say I thought of something new.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>But I do remember vividly that season of,
 like it's stressful, moving house.
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
  </li><li>Stressful building house.
  </li><li>Buying our first house.
 stressful, you know, all of that. And but then on top of that,
 all the paperwork for a green card. Yes. And that's when they
 were like, you're ineligible. Remember, because you haven't
 fully vaccinated. Yes. So then we had to hire a vaccination
 attorney and all of that going on. That was a fair amount of
 pressure. It was crazy. It was crazy pressure. And we had
 another family living with us at the time. Yeah, but that was
 joy. They were great. Yeah. Actually, I don't think I would
 have survived that season. If they weren't living with us. Yeah.
 No, no way we would have.
 Yeah.
 I mean, absolutely.
 But it did make eight of us in that little house and then your then your mom came.
 What I remember all of this very, very well.
 What I'm trying to remember is the joy said before me that helped me endure that
 season and the joy was that eventually you could be emotionally available to your wife.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 Are you going to say something else?
 I'm sorry.
 at the middle of my sentence,
 in or of the start of yours.
  </li><li>Yes, I apologize.
  </li><li>Yes, precisely that.
  </li><li>The lifelong dream of becoming an American
 was one step closer, filling out all this paperwork,
 filing all these injunctions, driving here,
 they are everywhere, going interviews.
 The same thing with like,
 oh, the actual dream of owning our own home,
 instead of renting.
 I mean, it was all leading to something,
 and I just remember that vision giving pain a purpose.
 You know, and also the joy of a baby boy
 and then also being able to be reunited in connection
 with giving my wife emotional support she needs.
 I mean, based on the tools we had,
 like I'm not trying to justify it at all.
 Like it was not a great solution,
 but it was the only solution I knew over the time.
 And we made it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, we did.
 Anyway, I've been thinking about that
 and the importance of knowing what are you waging war against?
 Like if, you know, 'cause scripture says that we're to pick up our cross and follow him
 and our cross will change in different seasons.
 Sometimes the cross is the stigma of the anointing.
 You know, you're being ridiculed at work for your beliefs.
  </li><li>Yep. - Sometimes the stigma is a difficult family.
 Sometimes, not your stigma, sorry, sometimes your cross is a marriage.
 Sometimes a cross is your, you're being treated unfairly, etc, etc, etc.
 Do you know what your cross is and do you know what your joy is?
 Yeah. What are you trying to head towards?
 Which interestingly, I'll start this year.
 At the start of every year, I like to sit before the Lord and just ask him,
 what do I need to know about at the start of this year?
 And the Lord told me like, this is a year about you finding your joy.
 Find out the people, the places and the things that bring you joy and invest in
 those things, which I think we mentioned when we talked about why we went to Disney
 world. Yeah.
 One of the other things I was thinking about is how
 This is going to sound negative and depressing at first, but I don't think it is.
 Is that often the joy that we're looking forward to is not presently in our life.
 Otherwise we would need to look forward to.
 Does that make sense?
 So the motivating joy.
 So well, you're pregnant and you're looking forward to having a baby.
 You don't have the baby yet.
 So it's out there and you're heading towards it.
 Oh, yeah.
 I mean, you do have the baby, but, you know, okay.
 Can you burp it?
 Can you feed it?
 Well, can you cuddle it?
 I figure I'm doing all of those things.
 We might be splitting it.
 (laughing)
 A non-amniotic bath.
 But like, you know, getting a house,
 getting your citizenship at all on its way.
 And sometimes the enemy will use that to discourage you
 when it's the very thing that Heaven's using
 to encourage you to keep going.
  </li><li>Right, yeah, that's good.
  </li><li>What do you think?
  </li><li>I think my only thought when you're saying that was that
 we're not saying you never arrive at joy.
 Like it's not, it's not out of three.
  </li><li>I'll never get to joy.
  </li><li>Never, never right there.
 But usually then there's a next thing
 that the Lord is pointing your heart towards.
 And, but I was also thinking like you're talking about
 kind of big things, like kind of hallmark things
 that would be like, oh yeah, I remember 2021.
 That was the year we X.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But we also are intentional about,
 tensionable.
  </li><li>We're intentional.
 We're intentional about making up our own words.
 We're intentional about realizing there are things
 that we already know that as a family bring us joy.
 And so we plan those, so we have little things
 to look forward to that are attainable
 and kind of keep that joy spark going
 as we're heading towards the bigger things.
  </li><li>Like we plan sabbaths.
  </li><li>We plan sabbaths, we plan nice dates,
 we plan camping with the kids.
  </li><li>Like in a few weeks we'll literally go away camping.
 But that was planned back in January.
  </li><li>Yes.
 So we plan like way ahead
 for to have like things that we know
 as a family we get to look forward to
 that are gonna happen.
 And then we have the big things
 that you're just, you know,
 listening to God and heading forward.
  </li><li>Yes, I wanna explore, yes,
 you're talking about we deliberately put in place
 things to interrupt the rhythm of life
 because we know life is gonna be busy.
 As Jesus said each day,
 don't worry about tomorrow
 'cause it's gonna forties of its own.
 So it's not that we're borrowing trouble,
 we're just anticipating that life gets busy
 and there are troubles.
  </li><li>We know how busy we are.
 We are very busy people.
 If we don't actually plan those,
 we're it's never gonna happen.
  </li><li>And then we'll be like, where did the time go?
 So we put those earmarks in.
 So literally we've got,
 and we try to hold that intention
 with we don't know what tomorrow's gonna come.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Right?
 And you know, we don't want to be those people
 as James was talking about,
 oh, tomorrow we're gonna do this,
 and then we're gonna stay in this city.
 We're just like, okay, as the Lord wills,
 we want to steward things well.
  </li><li>We would like to.
  </li><li>We have already booked out our favorite camping spots
 even for next year. - For next March.
  </li><li>Yep. - Yep.
 So we put that in place.
 But then you also said something interesting,
 that also walking with the Lord when you hear big things,
 we also manage the tension and the joy in that.
 Talk to me about that.
 So the Lord is speaking to us about big things.
 How do you manage?
 'cause usually big things require big cost.
 So how do you manage the inevitable cross
 or cost that comes with that
 and finding the joy in that?
  </li><li>I think, I don't know if you and I
 are wired a little differently.
 I think I have some kind of crazy chip that just says,
 hey, if God said, do this, he's gonna cover it.
 And I don't think of it much past that.
 Like just like, which probably frustrates you.
 but does it not?
 I just know like, you know, with big things often
 when the Lord's like, "Hey, I'm gonna do this."
 I'm like, "Yeah."
  </li><li>I think the thing that frustrates me
 is not so much that it is for me
 because you're also very high influencer.
 Sometimes it's difficult for me to discern
 which thing that you're excited about
 is the prophet speaking and you've heard from the Lord.
 And which part is the influencer speaking
 that you would like it to be the Lord.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Does that make sense?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Because sometimes your faith
 and your, wouldn't this be good, look very similar.
  </li><li>Yeah, that makes sense.
  </li><li>And so I'm like,
 because like all influencers,
 you have a very strong reality distortion field.
  </li><li>I'm actually not an influencer technically,
 but yeah, it's like my fifth language.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And yet you recognize the dynamic I'm talking about.
  </li><li>Yeah, I do.
  </li><li>Okay, so maybe we need to get you retested.
  </li><li>But that whole thing of like,
 and maybe it's part of the shaper,
 you have a plan and you have a passion for the plan,
 and you will see the plan through,
 but also as a high shaper,
 I'm a value in your plan going,
 I'm not sure your plan is robust as it would be.
 The difference being though, when it's the Lord,
  </li><li>I just have a crazy confidence that I--
  </li><li>You do.
  </li><li>I just sort of throw off the, but how--
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And go with it, God said,
 so I don't have to think about that.
  </li><li>And that works really well,
 but probably where we've gotten into trouble
 with a very small tea--
  </li><li>Yeah.
 same faith is applied, but isn't the Lord that's spoken? It's a wish list of spoken.
 Yeah, yeah. I would agree. Yeah, I would agree. So I don't think I get frustrated with the first
 one. I get frustrated at trying to bring the caution to the second one and not always being met
 as receptively as it is being right now. Because again, as a high shaper, you want your plan to
 succeed and I'm the turn the punch ball going but but but yes I agree yeah so in
 that like how okay so you answer my question you're like when it's the Lord
 I know I will find the joy as I become obedient yes so for me it's like
 there you just head forward like yeah there's gonna be potentially a lot of
 stuff you don't know you know yes there's gonna be there's gonna be
 there's going to be bumps in the road, there's going to be whatever.
 Well, I've got something for you.
 Okay.
 I got a verse for you, which I'm holding up.
 Hi.
 Do you want me to hold it over here?
 No, I don't.
 2 Timothy, chapter 4, verse 6.
 Yes.
 This is Paul writing to Timothy.
 Yep.
 And he says this.
 It's at the end of his life, for I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and
 the time for my departure is near.
 He was just so happy.
 He wrote cards for Hallmark.
 I have fought the good fight.
 I have finished the faith.
 I have finished the race.
 the faith. I have finished the race. I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown
 of righteousness which the Lord, the righteous judge will award to me on that day and not only to
 me but also to all who have longed for his appearing. And so I was reading that and I was thinking,
 right Paul, you know obviously Jesus literally carried across but Paul literally endured being
 shipwrecked and beaten and persecuted and etc. etc. You know he bore the marks of an apostle.
 So he is somebody who is continually joyful.
 Yes, even writing all of his letters from prison.
 Yes, super.
 You would never know that he's in prison for the joy and also
 enduring some of the worst stuff ever.
 Right.
 And so I've got to think like, what, like, what was his secret?
 But if you read first Timothy chapter one, so a letter earlier, he says this,
 "Timothy, my son, I'm giving you this command in keeping with the prophecies
 once made about you so that by recalling them, you may fight the battle well, holding on to faith
 in a good conscience which some have rejected and so have suffered shipwreck with regard to their
 faith. The key to finding the joy to help you endure the cross that you're carrying is to dig
 out your prophetic words. Yes. Because they point to something and help you fight your battles and
 keep your faith, the very faith that Paul was saying, he's clung on to all the time. Yes. I would say
 that we historically do that. Like with with all of the different big things that we've done.
 Right. We've had dreams. We've had prophetic words. We've whatever. And when the road gets
 rough, because it will get rough, that's just the nature of the day. In this world, you will have
 trouble. Yeah. Then looking back at those and saying, no, you know what God said, you know.
 And so actually I'm gonna, I'm gonna hold that up in front of God and say, Lord, I believe you.
 And this is what we heard from you, and it's going to be okay.
 And using prophetic words, dreams, things that we've journaled about to fight the fight.
 Because also us, I would not be so haughty to say that everything we've done is at the command
 of the Lord. That's not what I'm trying to say. And yeah, there are many things that we've done
 because we've received a command of the Lord. And some of those things are costly. Some of those
 things are like people are like, "Oh, are you serious?" You know, it's back to the example of
 pushing all the poker chips to the center of the table. And I have to remind myself,
 I'm doing this because you asked me to. Not out of victimhood, not out of blame shifting,
 but just like, "Oh, I'm in this situation because you asked me to do this and now I need you to
 apart of the red seas. Right. So I can cross to the side.
 Right. So, and I think, I think there is sometimes the perception that if God has
 asked you to do something, that it's going to be automatically, it's going to be
 easy because God asked you to do it. And that hasn't been my experience at all.
 My experience has been with all those big things. There has been plenty of days
 where we've had to completely rely on God. You told us to do this.
 And this feels so hard, you know, and whatever it is, you know, it isn't working right now,
 you know, but God, you said, and so I'm going to stay obedient.
 And the joy for that is the fulfillment of that prophetic word.
 Yeah, for sure.
 I've been thinking about that dream I had about where everything's bleak and dark.
 And then in a moment it switches and it's like Charlie and Chocolate Factor and it's bright and
 colourful and me and Jeff are sat in a part bench and we're looking at just this brand
 new season that's come. And Jeff and I turned to each other and said, "Oh, people will have
 wished they could have sown then so they could reap now." And the beauty of the prophetic
 that, I remember Graham Cook telling the story about, he gave a prophetic word to somebody
 about them being promoted and about favour and jobs. And then the very next day the person
 being fired from their job.
 And so the person rightly being confused
 by the prophetic word, Graham gave them.
 So they asked to meet with Graham and say,
 hey, you gave me this prophetic word,
 these are what happened.
 And so Graham was like, okay, well,
 let's first of all just talk about the elephant in the room.
 I could have absolutely missed that.
 And if I have, I'll absolutely own that and I'm so sorry.
 But knowing God like I do, I can't help but wonder
 if he knew that you were going to be fired
 the following day, he knows everything.
 And knew that you would need a liferaff
 to get you through the shipwreck moment
 of that event in life where you're fired.
 And in his kindness, he's being previous,
 he's telling you, hey, you need to know this.
 And he's not saying you need to know this
 so tomorrow when you're fired,
 he's just saying, hey, you need to know
 this is what's gonna happen.
 And that's your life, that's the joy set before you
 to endure this season knowing that he's good and he's kind.
 And I was like, oh, you know, I love that about the prophetic.
  </li><li>That's great, yeah.
  </li><li>But if it's misunderstood,
 we're, I think that's why Paul says don't despise prophecy.
 Hold fast to them because it's actually pretty easy to
 despise it. Absolutely. I think about, I know we joke about
 this, but I think about the profits, the series of profits
 that you got about meeting a man that God would have for you.
 Do you remember that? And they, probably the mistake they all
 made is they all added timing to it. They added timing or what
 the person looked like or where they were from. I'm so curious.
 Or what kind of car they drove.
 No, people gave you those words.
 Yes, you were going to drive a white Corvette.
 I was supposed to, yeah.
 Yeah, that was like--
 Maybe he made a white Tesla.
 No.
 Sure, I think speaking of Tans.
 It's the Lord, yeah.
 Yeah.
 Where was I supposed to be from?
 Of Washington State.
 Never been there.
 I know.
 So the intent was good.
 But like, you know, I think the beauty of the prophetic
 is that God gives us something that we might need.
 I think the downside of the prophetic is in our own flesh,
 we try and make that word what we want,
 not necessarily what it was designed for.
  </li><li>Yes.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I agree.
 So that makes me think of Galatian 6'9,
 which is...
  </li><li>Bible drill.
  </li><li>Bible drill.
 Let us not grow weary,
 because at the proper time,
 we will see what we're looking for if we don't give up.
 I mean, as essentially...
 Let us not grow weary in doing good.
  </li><li>Yeah, doing good.
  </li><li>Yeah, see the brethren comes out in me.
  </li><li>That's so good.
  </li><li>'Cause the proper time we'll reap a harvest
 of righteousness. - Yeah.
  </li><li>And so the important thing is that we don't give up.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Which is why we have joy to help us
 and for the choice that formed me in the cross.
  </li><li>So that we don't give up.
  </li><li>Imagine if Jesus gave up.
  </li><li>I know.
  </li><li>When I,
 when I went and did my postgraduate degree,
 I didn't wanna do my postgraduate degree.
 So the context is--
  </li><li>No, you wanted to skateboard.
  </li><li>No, no, at that point I wanted to be a dot com millionaire.
  </li><li>Oh, right.
 So I just graduated, I've been wooed by a large software company in California.
 I'm glad you didn't become a dot com millionaire.
 Really?
 Well, I never would have met you.
 Love finds a way.
 Okay.
 Um, to miss cool.
 Michael Crayton.
 Uh, yeah, like at that season of my life, I just graduated.
 I just been offered a job by a large software company in California, California, California.
 That's where they grew a cauliflower.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah. (laughs)
  </li><li>And I felt like the Lord very clearly said no.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then I felt like the Lord said,
 I want you to go become a teacher.
 And I hoped he didn't mean a school teacher, but he did.
  </li><li>He really did.
  </li><li>And so I went and became a school teacher.
 I enrolled against my, there's nothing in me.
 I literally remember saying,
 Lord, I'd rather bathe in my own vomit than be a school teacher.
 And he didn't change his mind despite my protests.
  </li><li>Have you thought about how much vomiting you would have
 to do to fill a bath?
  </li><li>No. - No, right.
 Okay.
 I go and become, I go and enroll, I quit my job, and I go and become a school teacher.
 And literally, hand on heart, the only reason I'm doing that is I think I've heard God say
 I want you to be a teacher. I'm not even that confident, but like, you know, if I had to place
 money on it, I would say yes. And I remember the first week I was sick, like physically sick.
 And I remember going home to Dundee to, you know, just stay at my parents' house because I was just
 super sick. And it's not that the Holy Spirit said anything to me, but I had this thought that I
 recognized now was probably the Holy Spirit. I recognized then it wasn't my own thought. And it
 was that verse about a double minded man is unstable in all his ways and we'll receive nothing
 from the Lord. And I thought that my double mindedness had literally made me sick. And if the only
 reason I was doing this was because God said to do it, then I actually, I should start with my
 double mindedness like am I, do I make a mistake like you've already committed, you've already paid your school fees, if you're wrong, then you've you know it's not that you've wasted a year like you've invested in the area of your life and I'm sure got a little demon.
 And if you're right you're being obedient either way quit your whining like nobody said that to me but that was my thought right and so I remember getting up very very early just as the someone's coming up my parents this is going to sound morbid but it was really beautiful.
 My parents' house at the time lived near a cemetery and the cemetery was on Balgate
 Hill.
 It was a big hill and it was tiered and it would overlook the River T in the sun.
 I remember the cemetery.
 In many ways so beautiful.
 It's a park attached to it.
 And so I just got up super early as the sun was coming up and I took my Bible and I went
 and read the seven letters to the churches in Revelation.
 And each letter ends with, "To him who overcomes I will give."
 And there's a promise to those who overcome that.
 I'm not trying to over-spiritualize it,
 doing a post-graduate degree and something I didn't want to do
 is somehow overcoming.
 But it was like, I feel--
  </li><li>Well, there was plenty to overcome.
  </li><li>Right, I feel like God's asking me to do this thing.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>In the natural stuff I don't want to do,
 hand on heart, the only reason I'm doing this
 'cause I think it's God.
 And I just remember thinking,
 God's gonna credit to me as righteous.
 Whether it was God or whether it wasn't,
 I believe it was.
 And so he's gonna be like, you're a,
 even if I miss it, you're adorable
 and I love the effort, a forever.
 Yes. And if it was him, it's like, hey, well done.
 Good and faithful servant.
 You did the thing.
 And I just remember that whole thing of like that,
 the seven overcoming promises were such an encouragement to me.
 And that literally became the joy set before me
 while I endured doing something I didn't want to do.
 Where's the promises?
 Well, the promises like, okay, Lord,
 I'm gonna get a new name that nobody knows.
 And you know, I'm gonna get to sit with you on your throne
 and I'm gonna get, you know, white robes and all these things.
 Like there was a promise like, okay, you know,
 I think Chris Valtin says it this way.
 You know, everybody wants the testimony,
 but nobody wants the test.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And so my encouragement to all of you who are listening
 is keep going.
 Like don't give up because you will reap
 a harvest of righteousness.
 Allow the joy.
 If you don't know what the joy is, find the joy.
 You find the joy by digging out your prophetic words,
 but keep going.
 Don't quit.
 Keep progressing.
 Fight the good fight with your prophetic words.
  </li><li>Sounds good.
  </li><li>All right.
 Let's just question.
  </li><li>There is one?
  </li><li>Major Jones, are you ready for a listening question?
  </li><li>I think so.
  </li><li>You think so?
  </li><li>We'll see.
  </li><li>You wanna see what the question is?
  </li><li>Yeah, I might say, Alan Jones, are you ready
 for a listening question?
  </li><li>This question from Marie.
 It's kind of similar to the question we answered last week.
 About like what to do when you realize
 you're making a mistake in relationships.
 This question introduces the element of finances.
 So the question is, what do you do if you've made a mess
 in a relationship that has a financial component to it?
 For example, you borrow a friend's insert item, pressure washer.
 Okay.
 Somebody should borrow your pressure washer because it's not being used here.
 If you need it, you just let me know you can come get it.
 Hold on.
 Sorry.
 Sorry.
 Sorry.
 Sorry.
 Sorry.
 Sorry.
 Sorry.
 Sorry.
 Sorry.
 Sorry.
 Sorry.
 And it gets broken.
 Yeah.
 You can't afford to repair it.
 What do you do in that situation?
 Oh, yeah.
 That's tricky.
 I think you have an honest conversation.
 You know, like here's the thing.
 I have, I think, I'm trying to think.
 I had friends when I was 20 years ago
 where I remember asking,
 "Hey, could I borrow, I think it was your camera
 "or something like that for something?"
 And this person said, "I would love to lend it to you.
 "However, I cannot afford to replace it.
 "You cannot afford to replace it."
 And so I think it's better for a friendship
 if I don't lend it to you.
  </li><li>Well, that's wisdom.
  </li><li>But he said, "If it was something I could afford
 to replace, I would happily lend it to you,
 but because it isn't and I do need to use it,
 I'm not going to lend it to you."
 And I was like, "Oh, that seems really wise."
 I have occasionally borrowed things
 where something has happened and it's gotten broken.
 And I just have saved up money to replace it
 or take an extra babysitting job or two
 or whatever to make the extra money to replace it.
 How did you like when you return it?
 Do you just own up to it?
 Like how have you done it?
  </li><li>I wrecked this or I broke this or whatever.
 And I'm really sorry.
 And here's my plan for how I'm gonna replace it.
  </li><li>Okay.
 You say what your friend said about the camera
 and it instantly makes me think of this
 call it the John Paul Jackson said.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>He said that before you ask to borrow money from a friend,
 ask yourself which one do I need most?
  </li><li>Ah!
 Wow.
 Like money or the friend.
  </li><li>Or the friend, yeah.
  </li><li>Oh wow.
 as put a wedge between friends.
 One of the, I don't, I mean, I'm sure we've talked about this,
 or whether we just arrived at this conclusion together,
 but as a general rule of thumb,
 you and I don't lend things,
 first of all, we don't lend money,
 'cause it puts a wedge between people.
 We'll give money, if it's hours to give
 and we're able to give it, and the Lord's saying to give it,
 we would sooner just give away money
 rather than lend money.
 but also same with things.
 Like I'm not going to borrow something
 unless I know I can be financially responsible to replace it.
 I'm not gonna ask to borrow it.
 If somebody offers to borrow or lend it to me,
 I'm not gonna do it.
 And the same thing with me,
 I'm not going to lend something to someone.
 Well, first of all, I'm gonna do my due diligence.
 Like, do you treat my stuff the way I would treat my stuff?
 In which case, I'm not gonna lend it to you.
 But the same sort of thing.
 I'm gonna, if I can't afford for a place--
  </li><li>If they treat it the same way you treat it,
 you're not gonna lend it to them?
  </li><li>No, if they don't treat them,
 the way I treat them. - If they don't, okay.
  </li><li>So for example, you know, if,
 like I have a lot of nerdy equipment.
  </li><li>Yeah, just treat.
  </li><li>And there's people I would happily lend it to
 because I watch the way they take care of the things
 that they do and trusted.
  </li><li>Sure, sure.
  </li><li>And then there's other people who I watch
 the way they handle things, I'm like, yeah, you're, no,
 no, that won't happen.
  </li><li>Not today, sports fans.
  </li><li>Right, but, and the underlying principle is,
 Can I afford to replace it and can you afford to replace it?
  </li><li>Right, because if the answer is no--
  </li><li>If the answer is no, then on some level,
 you could be risking relationship,
 which to me is more important.
  </li><li>That wasn't quite the question she was asking.
 She was asking, "If this has happened, how do you do it?"
 And I think if you're the perpetrator of the badness,
 you go to them and you own it instantly.
 Like I remember when we lived with John and Carol,
 who was my first time using their snowblower.
  </li><li>It wasn't your first time?
  </li><li>It wasn't? - No.
 I thought it was the first time I used my snowblower.
 Well, let's just say I didn't have a great
  </li><li>Let's imagine it was close to the first time.
  </li><li>And I used a snowblower and I drove the snowblower
 right into the front of their house
 and damaged the decorative fascia of their house.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>I don't even know how to replace that or repair it.
 I've got no idea how to fix it.
 I, you know, so I just have to, you know,
 and what made it worse is I'm trying to do them a favor.
  </li><li>Yeah, they're flying home and you're like,
 "I'm gonna snow blow the driveway so they can drive in."
 And then you ran into the side of the house.
 And I mean, cray, you know,
 and thankfully it was a decorative--
  </li><li>They were able to fix it.
  </li><li>But it's like, you know, what I do,
 just pile of snow up there and hope nobody knows this, no!
 Like, you need to own it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And just say, I damaged your house.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>While trying to do this.
 I don't know how to repair it.
 And nor am I expecting you just to take care of it,
 I don't have to do anything.
 Please let me know what I can do to fix it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Don't do the thing where you, you know,
 you damage something and then you go to a store
 buy a new one to replace it and don't tell them.
  </li><li>Like when your kid's goldfish dies,
 you go buy a new-- - Yeah, you replace
 when you refine it.
  </li><li>Own it and just say, hey, listen,
 I damaged this, I went and bought a new one.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So yeah, just like own up to your mistake.
 And I know it's terrifying 'cause you're filled with fear,
 you may be filled with guilt, maybe filled with shame,
 but it's responsible to do.
 Let me go one step further.
  </li><li>But I was gonna say, if you can't afford to fix it,
 then that's where it's like, okay,
 talk to the Lord about it, come up with a plan.
 What are you gonna do?
 you're gonna maybe work some extra hours
 or you're gonna like make sure it's still on you
 that you're not sort of looking at the person going,
 but actually, you know, I broke this thing,
 but you have enough money to like, you know.
  </li><li>Oh, that's so rude and safe, son.
  </li><li>So, you know, I'm sorry, you know.
  </li><li>Let me flip the question and make it one step worse.
  </li><li>Oh no.
  </li><li>What if in this friendship,
 you're not the person that's damaged it,
 but you're the person who's lent something to somebody
 and they damage it and they haven't owned it?
 Now what do you do as that friend?
  </li><li>Well, I'm never gonna lend them anything again.
 I don't want to make an inner vow, but.
  </li><li>That you go straight to that, there's no other stats?
  </li><li>Well, I would, I don't know.
 I mean, it probably depends.
 What level of friend are we talking about?
  </li><li>Or would you confront them as where I go?
  </li><li>Yeah, of course.
  </li><li>You would say, hey.
  </li><li>Hey, this came back and it's not supposed to make this sound
 when you shake it.
 (laughs)
 Yeah, I would.
  </li><li>What if they're like, oh no, it was like that
 when you gave me.
  </li><li>I would be like, well, it really wasn't.
 And if they want to hold to that, that's fine.
 but I'm not gonna lend you something again.
 You've just proved to me that that's not a good decision.
  </li><li>You've just moved to the outer ring of the lending--
  </li><li>Of the lending circle.
  </li><li>Yeah, the lending circle.
  </li><li>But I think for the most part,
 we try and only lend if we can be like,
 hey, if that gets wrecked,
 I don't need you to do something about it.
  </li><li>We lent our aging minivan to a friend.
  </li><li>Oh.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>That I just heard.
  </li><li>Aging, it's aging.
 (laughs)
 It's 18 years old, it's past aging.
 It's, it's, we weren't using it.
 And friends said, Hey, Zara, we could borrow it.
 And we're absolutely, it's one of the most responsible people
 we know, absolutely no problem.
 And so they returned it and they, you know,
 they quietly just said, Hey, just want to let you know that,
 you know, I don't even remember what it was.
 When I took it to.
  </li><li>It's making a sound, actually.
  </li><li>No, no, when I took it to a parking lot, you know,
 I came back, I realized somebody had opened a door and to,
 I don't even know if that was the thing.
 It was something minor that had happened or, you know,
 I was unloading the car and the car rolled
 on the side of the car.
 And I was like,
  </li><li>You could just go fall.
  </li><li>I go, you know, they were so earnest
 and I appreciated it.
 And I didn't think anything left.
 You know, of course they're gonna do that.
 That's who I know them to be.
 But I was like, trust me.
  </li><li>You know what?
  </li><li>It's fine.
 It's had three nasty children spill milkshakes
 all over the inside.
 Like it's totally okay.
  </li><li>You just call their children nasty.
  </li><li>No, their milkshakes are nasty.
  </li><li>Yes, yes, yes.
  </li><li>I hope that's what I said.
  </li><li>No, you said nasty children spilling milkshakes.
  </li><li>Nasty baby.
  </li><li>Wonderful children spilling nasty milkshakes.
  </li><li>Oh, man. - Own it.
 Own it, you know, you've already made the mistake.
  </li><li>Have the conversation.
  </li><li>Have the conversation, own it, always go in humility.
 And then also get good at extending mercy
 if you ever wanna be on the receiving end of mercy.
  </li><li>Yeah, for sure.
  </li><li>It's like I borrowed my friend's Tesla
 while he was out in the country.
  </li><li>Yeah?
  </li><li>And it is a car I cannot afford to replace.
  </li><li>Nope.
  </li><li>But you better believe I wanna check with my insurance
 that hey, if something happens,
 okay, I cannot afford the premium on my insurance
 if something happened.
 Yeah.
 But like that's what goes through my head.
 Otherwise, don't bore the test though.
 So like, absolutely.
 Because otherwise, it's now your friends problem
 and it shouldn't be.
 No, because it was my problem.
 So yeah, responsible living people.
 It's a glorious thing.
 I think I just spat everybody.
 Adalting.
 We don't need any more hashtags after two weeks ago.
