<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll in an AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Mrs. Jones.
  </li><li>Yes, sir.
  </li><li>Back with the librarian glasses.
  </li><li>Well, I know how you love the glasses.
  </li><li>You're ready to torment me?
  </li><li>But I'm, 'cause I'm gonna have to read things
 off of my phone, so.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I thought I would just leave them on.
  </li><li>How the heck are you?
 It's nice to see you.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>It's nice to see you.
  </li><li>That might sound odd, but it's been such a busy week.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, it's been a rough week.
 We've been crossing each other ships in the next time.
  </li><li>Yeah, basically we go to bed at night and go,
 "Oh, hi." (laughs)
  </li><li>On that topic. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Speaking of which, episode 258, welcome everybody.
 Weekly catch up, Jones, how was your week?
  </li><li>Such a busy week.
  </li><li>Well tell me about it, like I said, I haven't really seen you.
  </li><li>Yes, well, Totsunship.
  </li><li>You taught Sunship. - You taught Sunship.
  </li><li>You're too.
  </li><li>Give us a brief synopsis of Sunship.
 I mean, I know it takes two days to teach it.
  </li><li>Please don't do that to me.
 It takes six sessions and then we barely squeak it in.
 So it's talking about the different,
 that there's five different words that are used to describe
 or that we translate as sun in the New Testament,
 five different Greek words.
  </li><li>So in our English word, we just have one word sun.
 In Greek, they used five different words.
  </li><li>Yeah, and so it's like nepiospadian,
 technon, eniscos, and quios.
 And they're all, what?
 They're all--
  </li><li>You with your live classes teaching me.
 I don't know what's going on, I'll try and get it.
  </li><li>Keep it together.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So they're all different stages of sunship.
 They're all sunship, but they're different stages
 of maturing and we just look at what does it look like
 to be in that stage?
 What does it look like to be stuck in that stage?
 What do we do to get unstuck?
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>What is being fully mature sons look like?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>All that kind of stuff, so.
  </li><li>While you were teaching sunship,
 I was teaching the joy of sexual wholeness.
  </li><li>You were?
  </li><li>In your life.
  </li><li>And what does that look like?
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Look, there's no getting around it.
 It's hard because sexual sin is the sin that's so easily
 in tangles.
 I mean, lots of sins so easily in tangles,
 but you know, Paul talks about it.
 It's like it's worthy of stopping and talking about it.
 And one of the challenges I always give the students is
 like when was the last time you heard a message
 about sex in church?
 And for most people, the first time they hear it
 is on the school.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And it's not strictly true.
 I like to make the joke that the first time I heard anyone
 teach on sex in church was me speaking
 and sex in church.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And that's not true, I heard Jack Deere teach on it,
 but I was in church, I got a tape recording
 of him teaching on it.
  </li><li>Right, right.
  </li><li>And so you spend a week talking about sexual dysfunction
 and what it means, what's a biblical standard
 for holiness and why that's great
 and why that's not restrictive.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>And I think the difference is like normally
 when we teach in the school, we teach them to do ministry,
 teach them to ministry, teach them to ministry.
 Because all of the sexual sin is so entangled,
 we basically do four or five sessions in a row
 of just teach, teach, teach, teach, teach,
  </li><li>Right, just ramps up the stand.
  </li><li>Diagnose, diagnose, diagnose, diagnose.
 So that when we come to ministry,
 we're dealing with a whole lot of wants,
 and not just piecemeal.
 So that can be somewhat heavy stuff to go through.
  </li><li>Sure, sure.
  </li><li>Yeah, and then on the weeks that we teach,
 we're also having our meetings.
  </li><li>Yeah, we still have all the other things
 that we still get done.
  </li><li>Yeah, so it's a lot.
  </li><li>It's a lot.
  </li><li>It was slightly offset by the fact
 that Apple had a new fall conference,
 and then it was for you.
 Yes.
 It was for me.
 Yes.
 Was there nothing in there that you were interested in?
 Well, I don't know.
 I didn't get to watch it because I--
 Well, I'm a recast.
 I made dinner and then had to take a child to work
 or pick up a child from work or something.
 Well, you saw the new HomePod mini light colors.
 Yes, because you showed me the picture afterwards.
 Well, so then I asked Matt Books.
 Oh, AirPods, which we don't care about because we have
 their home clothes.
 Anyway, new Max, which I'm super excited about,
 but I won't bore every of the details.
 Don't be too excited about it.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>God can do it, actually, more than I ask or imagine.
 I'll be as excited as I want.
  </li><li>All right, you just be excited if you like.
  </li><li>Anything else?
 I don't think so.
  </li><li>No, that was it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>We talked, it's been busy.
  </li><li>And taught lots of meetings.
  </li><li>Hi, I'm Alan, have we met?
  </li><li>Oh yeah, I dropped the kids at youth last night
 and instead of driving 20 minutes home,
 waiting at home for 20 minutes
 or half an hour and driving 20 minutes back,
 I sat in the car and nearly fell asleep.
 I just basically sat there kind of nodding off
 for an hour and a half and then went in
 and got the monsoil.
 Let's go.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>God bless him.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Okay, we have done five things we didn't know about marriage.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>We've talked about five things we didn't know about having kids.
  </li><li>We did, yeah.
  </li><li>I asked what other five things people would like
 to ask the wax-lecrob lyrical about.
 And this week we're gonna talk about five things
 we didn't know about ministry or being in ministry.
  </li><li>Okay.
 Do you wanna go first?
 I went first last time.
 I want you to go first.
  </li><li>Oh, but you really thought through your list.
 This week has been so crazy that I literally had two things.
  </li><li>Can I tell him what you told him before he started recording?
 So like, we're, you know, we're just about to come downstairs
 to the studio and I'm just briefing AJ, you know, literally
 we have really not seen much of each other this week.
 So I said, "Hey babe, remember that we're talking about
 "five things we didn't know about ministry."
 She's like, "I've got two."
 I said, "I've already got two."
  </li><li>Then I'll pray that your journey downstairs
 is productive and revelatory.
  </li><li>But so I have five.
  </li><li>You have five, that's why I see Garb's face.
  </li><li>But I'm not sure that there is well thought through
 as yours, 'cause I'm sure that you--
  </li><li>So much pressure.
  </li><li>Deliberated.
  </li><li>Why, it's so much pressure.
 I didn't deliberate.
  </li><li>All right.
  </li><li>I sat down and wrote five.
  </li><li>All right, well, I can't go first if you want.
  </li><li>Go first.
  </li><li>And then you'll like, you'll like rain it in
 with like the joy and stuff.
 All right, good.
  </li><li>Was this a bad week for us to talk about
  </li><li>This is probably been such an intense week
 with lots of things to deal with.
  </li><li>Tell me about your five things she didn't know about management.
  </li><li>Okay, number one, that as a leader,
 we collect all the judgments of all the previous leaders before us.
 So it's like-- - Wait, wait, wait, wait.
 Let's just stop.
 Let's get in the care of your week.
  </li><li>I'm not caught though.
  </li><li>Well, so, I mean, this is something
 we tell the small group leaders as well, like,
 Hey, when you start leading a small group,
 like when you step into authority,
 you represent for the people that you're leading authority
 and any dealt with judgments that they have
 from dealing with authority, including parents.
 So you are their dad, their mom, their pastor,
 their whatever, whatever things that they have in dealt with.
  </li><li>Yeah, you were a walking representative of their heart.
  </li><li>Right, I didn't know that.
 So did I know that about stepping into ministry?
 No, I didn't.
 I was just like, yay.
 And I would say even like, I mean,
 that my first eight years of ministry was itinerating.
 I didn't really encounter it, itinerating.
 I itinerating, you just blow into a church,
 blow up the church sometimes,
 or hopefully encourage poor and love you.
  </li><li>I can't remember Father Christmas.
 You can, you share some gifts, you leave,
 you don't have to deal with any of the fallout.
  </li><li>Yeah, but once you start,
 once you're like settled in one spot,
 And you now represent that person for them.
 That was one of the things that I had no idea.
  </li><li>And because of that revelation,
 it's one of the first things we teach
 the people we're training to be leaders.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It's like, here's a dynamic to be aware of.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>That often you will become the target
 of everybody's previous judgments regarding,
 as you say, authority figures,
 passive teachers, leaders.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And also a fun thing to factor is
 you've got your own judgments
 that will also you'll read through the people
 that you're leading.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Okay, well, that's a true one.
 What's number two?
  </li><li>Number two is I never thought about
 the whole thing of your whispers or shouts,
 like, you know, that as a leader,
 you can't be flipping.
 You can't, like, like you may be sitting there
 joking around about something,
 but because you're a leader, it becomes,
 you know, becomes something else.
 Like people will take things out of context or whatever.
 So there's like a level of responsibility for,
 for what you communicate, how you communicate,
 what you like on Instagram, you know,
 all that kind of stuff that doesn't exist
 before you're actually in ministry or in leadership.
 And just like having to actually process that through.
  </li><li>Well, have like an extra step of thought
 about what you do say where.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And like to be honest with you, I'm fine with it,
 But I never realized I would need to think about that.
  </li><li>Do you remember when you realized that that was a dynamic?
 Was there an event, a situation,
 something that backfired that you were like,
 oh.
  </li><li>I think there was a few things that I watched backfired,
 not so much that were things that I said,
 although I'm sure it's happened.
 Like I can't think of anything when I'm sure it has,
 but where I have been part of a team
 where I watched something,
 Oh, that I was there.
 I know that person was joking, but it was taken as, you know, not
 gospel, but you know what I mean?
 It was taken and just like, Oh, yeah, because, you know, you're a leader now.
 So you're when you say something, it's just taken a little differently.
 Great line that Dan Farley taught us about your way too powerful to joke like
 that or your way too powerful to share something like that.
 You're, you know, I remember a prophetic dream.
 I forget his name was Steven.
 He was at a Morningstar.
  </li><li>Thompson.
  </li><li>Steve Thompson.
 And he had a dream that he was on a building site
 and that people were throwing all sorts of power tools at him.
 And he was like, why are we throwing these things at me?
 And he just kind of looked around at something
 he could use to defend himself.
 And he found a tiny screwdriver that he picked up
 and he threw.
 And the tiny screwdriver pierced somebody.
 It did so much damage where all these power tools missed him.
 And the Lord was saying to him, as a prophetic minister,
 your words have more power.
 There's more authority, make sure you use your words for good enough for bad.
 I never forgot that.
 I was like, yeah, we need to be so careful.
 And it's a privilege, I think, like, like, I just didn't know about it, but I don't feel like, Oh, man, you know, I feel like it is a privilege.
 And and also we need to just stay where I've learned that dynamic the wrong way where I might be.
 Like, I remember one weekend as taking a group of men away for a men's weekend.
 And, you know, if you've watched, if anybody's in our sphere, you watch like the camaraderie that
 say me and Jeff have or me and Josh Parsons have, where we've got long history together,
 we'll be making jokes back and forward. And a lot of the jokes that we'll make are benign.
 They're like on the scale of like from one to ten. They're like, you know, between zero and one in terms of
 Offensiveness. Mm-hmm. But if you are new to our culture, perhaps if you're new to a culture where you're not used to pastors behaving that way
 Seeing a pastor say or joke or Josh about something. That's like a one
 Might seem like a seven or an eight. Mm-hmm. And so what happened this I took a group of guys away
 many who I didn't really know that well.
 And one of the guys in an effort to kind of build
 camaraderie, I guess, makes like the most inappropriate
 comment ever that I would say is like an eight or a nine.
 And when I, you know, confronted about that,
 when I was like, what are you doing?
 He's like, what?
 Like I see you in, you in Jeff or you and Josh,
 you know, make jokes and we're like, never like that.
 But the disconnect for him was, oh, to see my pastors
 make a funny joke about.
  </li><li>Right. And I'm just making a funny joke.
  </li><li>And I'm making a funny joke.
 And I was like, oh, okay, yeah, we like,
 yeah, you can't be doing that.
  </li><li>Yeah, and I mean, I mean, one of the things we,
 that goes along with this, that we tell the small group leaders
 is you're being watched all the time,
 which is like, that can sound really creepy.
 But the truth is you are, you know.
  </li><li>Who you like, who you follow.
  </li><li>Where you show up.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>All that stuff.
  </li><li>All of that adds endorsement, even if it doesn't mean
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I think it's really funny because when this,
 This is an interesting, nobody has said anything to me about this yet, but I had enough curiosity
 this week with events.
 For example, I'm not sure I want to go into that.
 Let me tell you the thing without my, for example, when President Trump was in power,
 I followed President Trump on Twitter, because I think it's important I know what my president
 is saying.
 I don't have time to watch every news clip and everything.
 me following President Trump on Twitter, I'm sure said something to some people like,
 I'm sure that adds meaning back to my whole storytelling thing. Yeah. Right. The fact is,
 I'm following President Trump. The story that people could write about why I'm following President
 Trump varies will vary depending on where you are. Now that President Biden is in power,
 I follow President Biden on Twitter for exactly the same reasons. I want to know what our
 our president is communicating, I don't read newspapers,
 I'm not.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And that equally will have stories attached to it.
 And it's just, yeah.
 And then what's interesting is when does boundaries
 kick into that?
 When does like your, when does your responsibility
 to lead people well end and begin with what you say
 where go, do you know what I mean?
 Like you want to use wisdom.
 Jesus is very clear about that.
 You don't want to cause somebody else to stumble.
 And at what point is they're stumbling,
 their responsibility, your responsibility,
 we should do a whole topic on that.
  </li><li>Maybe.
  </li><li>All right, number three.
 I love that what you said maybe,
 the most non-committal answer.
  </li><li>No, three.
  </li><li>That then knew.
 We will not talk about that.
  </li><li>I just realized that my number two
 wasn't actually on my list,
 so I have six, so I'm trying to ditch one.
  </li><li>Overachiever, give all six, I'm going to miss one.
  </li><li>Okay, well, I mean, some of them are kind of shorter.
 Like one, I feel like pastoring
 is essentially parenting adults.
 You know, like I'm back though.
 Well, you know, maybe I'm more encountered this
 when it's young, young adults,
 but basically you're re parenting,
 you're sort of trying to restructure.
 You absolutely are.
 People inside a world where the Bible is, is relevant
 and all the, but a lot of it just feels the same as,
 it doesn't feel that different from parenting little kids.
 You're repeating the same thing over and over again.
 You're giving grace to figure it out,
 to make mistakes, to let your heart expand,
 So to work that whole thing out and then you're coming along and you're helping them, you know,
 make decisions and you know, all that kind of stuff.
 My only concern with what you just said and like what you said, number two is that could sound horribly patronizing
 and knowing your heart, you don't mean that patronizing.
 No, I don't. I just mean like, oh, like, I think because no, I don't mean it patronizing.
 I just was like, oh, like actually it kind of helped me.
 Again, I think because I'm thinking in terms of
 sonship as well, like everybody is in some stage of maturing.
 &gt;&gt; Yep.
 &gt;&gt; Basically, as pastors, what we're trying to do is help people get to
 the next stage of maturing, which is to me the same as what we're doing with our kids.
 &gt;&gt; Right.
 &gt;&gt; It's just that there are actual biological children.
 &gt;&gt; The other thing that you mentioned about it feels like
 re-parenting, like you're right because fatherlessness is a huge thing.
 Right.
 And even if people have fathers and mothers and fathers, a lot of the things that we work
 with people is the wounds from their parenting. So there is an element of parenting. I love what
 we have a pastor at our school called Matt Christhorn. I love what Matt says, that like part of the
 joy of his job is he gets to give people a different experience of authority. Yeah.
 So he gets to meet with people who got an expectation of how a pastor should respond.
 Right. And he gets to respond a different way and write a new story for them, which I think is
 beautiful. I love that too. Okay, so you had a bonus one. What was your next one? What are we at?
 Number four. Well, that was three. So now we're at four. I didn't know how much admin would be
 involved. I nearly put that one down. Seriously though. Like, so it's really funny to me because
 often people will ask questions that are equivalent of like, what do you do Monday to Friday? You know,
 We see you on the platform on Sunday.
 It's not Sunday, and I'm just like, good heavens.
 Like, you know, what do I do?
 I can't even tell you all the things I'm doing Monday.
 Sunday is my lightest day.
 You know, so I was just thinking that like it's, because it's one of the, again, it's one of the things when we've brought on ministerial assistance or whatever.
 And we just prep them like, Hey, being up on that platform, that's less than 10% of what you do.
 Way less.
 And so, you know, just be aware of that.
 Because I think some people, the lure to being ministry is the platform.
 Like, "Oh, I get to share." You know? Great.
 You also get to prep. You also get to... I mean, there's all the other things.
 You get to pray. You get to cancel. You get to meet with people.
 You get to put out fires. You get to answer emails. You get to plan.
 You get to troubleshoot. You get to meet with attorneys.
 You get to fight fires. Like, it's wild.
 It's wild.
 Yeah, so anyway, that was one of my things.
 It was like, oh, there's a lot more admin
 or behind the scene type stuff than I thought.
 But that all of that makes sense
 because without ever being in ministry,
 your only exposure to ministry is the public face of ministry.
 It's Sunday morning.
 Which is I come and I listen to a speaker.
 Yeah.
 And I mean, I don't think either of us were naive enough
 to imagine that's all they did.
 And that was through Friday,
 they were kicking back drinking peanut coladas.
 Right.
 I didn't know how much.
  </li><li>But it was funny, like I was talking to Shannon today
 and I was like, you know, 'cause I was thinking about this
 and I was thinking, like, have you ever had anybody be like,
 what do you do the rest of the week?
 And she's like, yup.
 Like, so it's like a thing, you know,
 because I've been asked that so many times, like, oh,
 and you know, and when the school's not in session,
 like, what are you doing this summer?
 I'm like, oh my gosh.
 Well, I only work 40 hours a week in the summer,
 but that's what I do, you know?
 So, yeah, so it's things like that.
 So that was my, was that my four?
 So, five, I didn't know that I would spend so much time crying over people.
 Your eyes have gone glassy.
 Yeah.
 Do you want to talk about that?
 Well, do I want to talk about that?
 Sure.
 Well, I just mean like, crying over people, whether it's crying over people that you've
 poured into and you're watching them walk away from the Lord and you don't get to make it
 better decision for them. So you just have to watch them walk
 this horrible path and hopefully, you know, and just pray that
 they make their way back and wait, you know, and then just cry
 over things that happen to people that you're like, I love
 this person, I hate that this has happened. And it's, you know,
 yeah, I just I didn't realize I'd spent so much time crying
 over, you know, other people. Yeah.
 I guess, I guess that's good.
 I mean, you know, like on one level, it's like, yeah,
 because you love those people.
 Yeah.
 But and some seasons are worse than others, but.
 Some seasons are better than others.
 Some seasons are better than others.
 Yeah.
 I'm just helping write the shit.
 Well, I just mean like, you know, you have your weeks where
 it's like, oh, it feels like there's so many things this week
 that it's like, I, you know, I'm crying with the Lord about it.
 Oh, I'm so sad that that happened.
 And then there's lots of great things that happen too.
 But I think I just didn't expect that part of it.
 Like I don't know why, but I didn't.
 Well, I think also because both of our ministry lives largely started out itinerant.
 Right, which so you don't really know people's...
 No, you're not there.
 They're not there. Yeah.
 So for those of you who are not familiar with the phrase itinerant ministry,
 I never was when you described yourselves as an itinerant ministry.
 An itinerant minister is somebody who visits churches conferences events.
 So just they kind of fly in, they speak, they share like kind of a comfort speaker.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Whereas our role is we're in a local church.
 We are the same local church for the last 13 years.
 So right.
 And so you're with people and like, you know, 13 years in one sense,
 is not a huge amount of time.
 In another sense, you know, for us pastoring twenties and thirties,
 we've got people that we've pastored who arrived fresh out of high school,
 who then got married, some of them are now having kids, like a lot of life
 happens in 13 years.
 Yeah.
 I think I think as you're saying that like I think
 Some of the crying part of it is because you love people like so I'm thinking
 Did I encounter this before I went to full-time ministry?
 Yes, I did with my small group, you know
 Or whatever like in youth leadership like when when those people would be having a hard time crying with them and and whatever
 And I just think
 Again, maybe the more lives that you get to touch the more
 People you fall in love with the more
 You know
 There's the potential for more yeah more crying with them well the more investment
 The more you love someone the more you open up your heart to being hurt. Yeah, thanks chip, Dodd
 Yeah, thanks chip. Do I get to do my number six? Give me your bonus number six
 My bonus number six is that the best thing ever is to be able to do what you're called to do and that you get the grace for
 everything else I
 like that.
  </li><li>Well, like, I know I'm called to be a ministry.
 I know I'm doing what I'm called to do.
 I'm not looking for like one day,
 I'll do what I'm called to do.
 I'm doing it.
 I'm built to build people and I get to do that.
 And it's amazing.
 And so all the other things that feel like harder
 than doing the stuff that feels easier,
 like the teaching and walking alongside people,
 kind of stuff. The grace comes along to do all of the other parts.
 Good list. Thanks. Six, baby.
 Six, yeah, you over a
 That's right. On the stairs, 12 stairs, four points.
 All right. What have I got? I've got number one.
 Think about this. What's one of the things I've learned about ministry?
 I didn't know before. Yeah.
 And number one would be team is more important than gift.
 Oh, yeah. Really good.
 Your team is more important than your gift.
 And I was thinking about that.
 I was like, is that true?
 And then I think about Jesus.
 Jesus was is the most gifted person ever.
 Like Jesus could have come to earth and accomplished his whole ministry
 without the need of the disciples.
 Didn't need him.
 Yeah, absolutely could have accomplished everything.
 It still doesn't even need us.
 And yet Jesus chooses his team over his giftedness.
 I love it.
 And in fact, trained up his people to do what he was doing.
 And actually, I had confidence that they would do,
 because I got the father, greater things than these,
 you'll do, which is amazing.
 So Jesus prioritizes his team over his gift.
 And I think that's a lesson I didn't know.
 And I love watching that.
 I love my kids are now in youth ministry.
 And I just want to brag on our youth leader.
 So like Brighton Shaley, a rat-liff who are youth pastors,
 amazing leaders, amazing leaders on their own right.
 And one of the things that they've done so brilliantly
 is that they've consistently, year after year after year,
 raised up an amazing team that they then empower.
 So like last night of youth, it wasn't Brett or Shaley
 who spoke, it was Becca who spoke.
 And I'm like, I love that, I love their priority
 on their team.
 Even like I love the way we do worship,
 we made a concerted effort in the hiring of Josh and Sarah Parsons, who neither are worship
 leaders, which like most churches would hire a worship leader to run the worship department.
 But the beauty of Josh and Sarah's approach to ministry is they are gifted individuals.
 I mean, Josh and Sarah are gifted people.
 And they prioritize their team over their gift and we benefit because of that.
 I think about every year when our students go on outreach,
 I love that in the four weeks that the students are on outreach,
 they are more effective than we are.
 As in for us.
  </li><li>Yeah, they're touching such a wider group of people.
  </li><li>They're touching six nations and ministering
 way more effectively than we could.
 And I just like, I love that whole
 Ministry Multiplication Model.
  </li><li>So good.
  </li><li>Didn't know that before I started in ministry.
 Number two is a similar to what you said.
 Most ministry happens off the platform.
 Yeah.
 Most of the ministry happens off the platform.
 Yep.
 And another thing, I'll throw this in for free.
 Probably for every hour I minister on the platform,
 there's minimum of 10 hours of preparation before.
 Oh yeah, for sure.
 So even when you do see the ministry in action,
 a lot of stuff has happened.
 But let's take like the vast majority
 of my ministry at Grace Center is invisible.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 That I mean, I've I've I've I've done a lot of speaking on Sundays this year in
 part because of the strange year that we had with Jeff being out caring for his
 family. But on a general week that the main focus of our ministry is not
 platform.
 No, it's all behind the scenes behind the scenes.
 And I didn't know that.
 And I loved that.
 I got a little insight into that.
 travel with John and Carol because before I knew John and Carol as these
 public figures who stood on a stage, but then being with them and traveling with
 them and accompanying when they were doing that, I also, John was so generous
 with his time that he let me in on all the meetings he would take while on the
 road. And I realized how much ministry would happen in seemingly random moments
 in coffees and conversations, how much strategic stuff would happen on planes,
 you know, conversations that you would have phone calls.
 And I didn't know that before I started a ministry.
 I should have known that because when you read the gospels,
 so much of Jesus's ministry is not public facing.
 No, no, that's I find that fascinating.
 Number three, the cost of leadership is being misunderstood.
 Like the burden of being a leader, the burden of being a ministry,
 the price you pay for that is being misunderstood.
 Can I go now? I want to go.
 Do you disagree?
 No, no, I don't disagree at all.
 And and you have to make peace with that.
 You have to make peace with you're going to burn yourself out and be an ineffective
 leader if you're constantly having a run around and correct what you think people
 think about you is right.
 Like, right.
 You just have to love people really well, aim in the right direction.
 I'm not saying you never have to clean up your masses or you don't have to
 re- clarify things.
 Absolutely have to clean up your mess.
 You do.
 But I'm just saying, hey, bear in mind.
 And like, I mentioned this when I'm, you know, teach all the time, like as a pastor, it's
 not my job to make sure people are happy with me as a pastor.
 If it was, I would burn out.
 Right.
 Just this week, I had to chuckle.
 We were having a discussion.
 We were having a discussion about, you know, I know of people who have left Grace Center
 because we're way in their, in their head, I'm leaving Grace Center.
 It's way too liberal.
 And the reason I laugh at that is we also people.
 conversation with people like the reason I'm leaving Grey's
 and it's just it's way too right.
 It's way too conservative.
 And I'm like, these people have experienced the same,
 the same church experience.
 And have come to radically different outcomes.
 And that's part and parcel of the cost of--
 Yeah, can't fix that worry.
 Yeah, made peace with it.
 And it's not that I'm indifferent to the fallout of that
 and the hurt that causes, but we have to understand, yeah,
 that's part of the cost of doing business.
 Number four, I knew this verse before I ever knew what I meant,
 unless the Lord builds the house of Labor's labor in vain.
 There is equally, there is so much stuff that you can get accomplished
 that is not the Holy Spirit of work.
 Right. Just said of giftedness.
 Giftedness.
 Strategy.
 Strategy. Oh, yeah.
 And then equally, there's so much stuff that you can do that never goes off the ground
 because the Holy Spirit is not breathing on it.
 And the sterning which is which is a mystery.
 One of my favorite, you know, I mentioned John and Carol,
 pastors of Toronto, Toronto Airport, Vineyard, Toronto Airport, Christian Fellowship,
 now Casio Fire Toronto, a church that revival hit in 1994, impacted the whole world.
 And I don't know how many million people came through the doors of the church,
 but I remember people, I remember it would go, people would always want to ask John one question
 why your church?" And he would just giggle. And he said, "Honestly, you think it was because of
 our master planning, our brilliant strategy, our marketing program that got people there?
 Like, no, it wasn't. Like, why our church? I don't know why our church. Perhaps we're at the end of a
 runway, so it was easy to get to. I don't know the answer to the question. I've got some thoughts.
 I don't think John and Carol would ever talk about themselves, but I think part of the region is
 who they are and they are all about creating space for the Holy Spirit. But nevertheless,
 my point was that the smart thing you can do as a minister is partner with what the Holy
 Spirit wants to do rather than do what you think you should do and ask him to bless it.
 Yes. You know, allow God to plan your blessings rather than am asking to bless your plans.
 Good. I like it.
 I feel like you're rushing me.
 I know. I'm just trying to say something other than, yep.
 (laughs)
 You could say diplodocus.
 You could say osteoporosis.
 There's so many words you could say.
  </li><li>You're right, I'll use osteoporosis next time.
  </li><li>Okay, number five.
 And maybe this is hard.
 Maybe this is what prompted your tears.
 It's certainly prompted mine over the years.
 Is after, I don't know how many years
 we've been in full-time ministry.
 We've been at Grace Center for 13 years.
 But I still cannot tell the condition
 of the soil of people's hearts.
 Now what I mean is if you were to line up a hundred people and to ask me, "Hey, Alan,
 you've got some experience in the church and with leaders."
 Who do you think are going to be, after 10 years are going to be going for the Lord?
 Who do you think is going to be in a state of moral decline?
 Who do you think is going to absolutely shipwreck their faith impossible for me to tell?
 I have in the 13 years that I have helped raise leaders.
 I heard somebody at Bethel once say, "What we found is you have to kiss a lot of frogs
 to find your prince. What I mean by that is we have led a school for over 10 years where we have
 poured some of the best resources into people and watched some people radically get transformed
 only to stay transformed only to produce incredible fruit. And then we've seen some people
 get radically transformed and burn out and within a year are no longer walking with the Lord.
 And we've seen some people seemingly produce zero fruit during the school.
 They're just slow, steady, no amazing testimonies.
 Checking with them five years later, they're still slow and steady.
 They're still producing amazing fruit.
 Like, it is.
 I used to think that I would be able to pick good leaders.
 No, you know.
 Do the best you can.
 Well, osteoporosis.
 I just think that's a fascinating dynamic that only God knows.
  </li><li>The quality of the soil of people's hearts.
  </li><li>Well, I think so, yes, but I also think
 it's because we're individually responsible
 for keeping our soil.
  </li><li>Yes, telling our soil.
  </li><li>And I don't mean you and I are responsible
 for anybody else's, I mean, I'm responsible for mine,
 you're responsible for yours,
 like keeping the soil fertile
 and keeping relationship and dealing with my stuff
 and whatever, and I think that's where it gets tricky
 because it sort of depends on all the things
 that aren't dealt with.
 Like if you were to have five people
 that all have great soil, let's say,
 but you have two or three of those people
 where the soil's really great right now,
 but there's a whole bunch of,
 there's a beach ball worth of stuff
 that they've pushed down,
 never dealt with, blah, blah, blah.
 If all five of those people hit trauma,
 the beach ball people are probably in trouble, right?
 And so that's gonna become like
 the least important thing in that season.
 Do you know what I mean?
 So I feel like, yeah, you can't tell,
 and you could be looking at what you're seeing
 in this snapshot in this moment is like,
 no, that's accurate.
 These people are all full on,
 but it's also, you don't have all the other stuff to know
 how are they gonna walk out the future?
  </li><li>I read a fascinating comment on Twitter.
 I think I probably saved it,
 so if I can find it, I'll put it in the show notes.
 But this, I think with Pastor or Leader
 we just said, "In my years of experience,
 I've determined to nothing reveals
 the character of a Christian faster
 than them not getting what they want."
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I would agree with that.
 That's a great litmus test.
 Two great litmus tests that I've discovered
 doesn't help you future, you know, like looking at the future,
 but does help you in the process
 is how people handle power and how people handle pain
 and what they do with that.
 osteoporosis. Yes, you're really holding on to that one.
 Anything else you want to say around what we didn't know in ministry?
 No. No.
 You overachieved.
 Yeah, I had six.
 So I already, you know, I threw my information into the ring.
 All right. Well, I have a listeners question for you.
 Well, actually, you know, you always do this to me.
 So I think I have a listeners question for you,
 assuming I can read the type. Ooh, I can see glasses.
 All right.
 Hemi with your question. All right. Here it is.
 This is a question from Kendra and she says,
 "My husband and I were having a conversation the other night
 about being able to hear from God."
 In other words, does God speak to us
 outside of what scripture says?
 I believe that yes, we have a two-way conversation
 with the Lord and one of the ways that we can do that
 is through journaling, which you both have highlighted
 in previous podcasts, episodes.
 My husband, on the other hand,
 thinks that method is too subjective.
 How do you know if you're hearing from God
 and it's not just last night's pizza
 or your own thoughts?
 His main point though is why would God
 have trouble speaking to us?
 He might be, okay, so there's tons of questions in here.
  </li><li>I imagine there's lots of question marks there.
  </li><li>And handily, you have broken down actually
 what are the numbers of questions that are contained within the question?
 So we're going to do a question by question.
 We do it that way.
 Yeah.
 Go for it.
 So here's the first one.
 OK.
 Does God speak to us outside of what scripture says?
 Yes, God does speak to us as a scripture.
 Yes, absolutely.
 The whole Bible is a record of God speaking to his people outside of the Bible.
 The whole Bible is a record of God speaking to people outside of what's written.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, okay.
 All right, so the second question is,
 how do you know you are hearing from God
 and it's not just pizza or your own thoughts?
  </li><li>Well, the notion that you wouldn't need to discern that
 if God spoke clearly to you is an error of understanding
 because there's plenty of examples of God speaking
 really clearly and people still missing what God was saying.
  </li><li>Right.
 Mark 129, when Mary, when the angel shows up to Mary, Luke 129, thank you, Luke 129,
 the angel shows up, speaks audibly to Mary and it says that, you know, Mary pondered,
 you know, what could this message mean? So even though there was clarity, there was still
 subjectivity to it like that. Like again, so that's a real thing. There's an
 example in scripture where God spoke audibly and the people, you know, some people thought
 it was an angel, some said it was thunder, they still missed it. So my point is no matter
 how clear the message is, again, we have a Bible full of examples of God speaking clearly
 to his people and his people still not getting the message. But to answer the question of
 like, how do you know it's not just pizza, how do you know it's not just subjective,
 scripture gives us ways to test that. That's why we're told to test every word, to weigh
 every word. And you filter it through the word. Absolutely. We've talked about that ad nauseum.
 And so if you just go to our podcasts and search for human God's voice, you'll hear us talk all about
 how do you do that? But provision and scripture is made for that. Okay. Number three.
 Why would God have trouble speaking to us? That's such a great question. And God would not have
 of trouble speaking to us, we would have trouble listening to him.
  </li><li>Yeah, hearing him.
  </li><li>Which again, the whole Bible records.
 Like one of the most curious passages in all the scripture
 is the Exodus.
 So the people have just been freed in spectacular ways.
 You've had all the plagues, you'd separation between
 the Jews and the Gentiles, then a miraculous release.
 You know the-- - Pillar fire.
  </li><li>Well the seaports and the-- - Seaports.
  </li><li>Oh, the whole, yeah. - Oh, yeah.
 And then Moses is like, "Stay right here.
 I'm gonna go speak to God who did all this for you.
 I'll be right back.
 Don't do anything dumb."
 In the time that he's gone, he's like,
 "God is abandoned us.
 Let's just quickly build an altar."
  </li><li>Does he even know that we're still here?
  </li><li>And you're just like, how did you go from,
 and that wasn't a problem at God's end.
 He had, he was present in their midst,
 spoken very clearly, demonstrated with signs, wonders,
 miracles, and still people left.
 But the answer to that question can be answered
 by Job 33 verse 14.
 For God does speak now one way, now another,
 though man does not perceive it.
 So the problem isn't with God speaking,
 it's with us being able to discern that He's speaking.
 And I like to say that my problem
 in learning to hear God's voice
 is that I had to learn how God spoke
 rather than demand that He speak the way I already hear.
 So that's where the problem lies, not God's end.
  </li><li>It also makes me think of that old story
 about somebody stuck in a flood
 and they're on the roof of their whatever flooded house.
 And they're like, hey, you know, come,
 come, God, like come rescue me
 and somebody goes buying a canoe and their person's like,
 no, no, it's good.
 God's gonna rescue me and somebody goes buying a motorboat
 and somebody comes buying a helicopter
 and it's like, well, God, where are you?
 We just keep missing him because we think it's supposed to,
 we think we know what it's supposed to look like.
 Anyway, question number four.
  </li><li>And by the way, bravo for embedding four questions in one.
  </li><li>Right.
 Brilliant. This is the epic question answer scenario right here. What's number four?
 Why would something like sin or UGBs prevent us from hearing what the Lord is saying if God
 didn't have trouble getting across what he wanted to get across to the people in the Bible?
 Well, that question is based on a faulty premise that God had no problem getting
 message across the people's time. Like David was a man after God's own heart. Right. And so the
 question is why would sin get in the way? Well David sins with Bathsheba and is so deaf to the
 voice of God that the prophet has to come to him and explain to him what he's done in a parable
 about like this, you know, this rich young man and he steals this lamb and it's even the lamb
 and he slaughters it. And David is incensed not even seeing the most elementary word picture ever.
 Right. And so the prophet has to go, "The man is you." Yeah. So why does sin, like why would
 God have a problem? You know, why would sin block it? I don't know because that's one of the
 problems of sin. It keeps us from God. It keeps us from hearing. Yeah. It keeps us from hearing,
 absolutely. For sure. The same example that I just read about the, you know, the
 Israelis being set free, the Hebrews, sorry, being set free from Egypt. Like, why were they kept
 from hearing what they were supposed to see. They just seen the most miraculous displays.
 And that is the problem of our ungodly beliefs. If we have an ungodly belief that God won't
 speak to us, then God could speak to you all you want. Like, I had dreams of God speaking
 to me before I ever realized it was real. In fact, I remember, I've told the story before,
 wondering whether God spoke in dreams. And I had a dream that I thought, "Oh, that's
 so weird, but I'll write it down.
 And then a couple of weeks later,
 the dream that I wrote down literally happened
 and it helped me understand,
 oh God, is speaking through that dream.
 Prior to even the Holy Spirit
 he gave me grace to wonder if he had,
 I would have just dismissed that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 When we talk about hearing God
 or operating in the prophetic,
 we talk about you having a filter that we hear through
 and sin clogs the filter, right?
 So when we have active sin in our life,
 then we find, oh, actually,
 I'm not having checks in the spirit,
 so we think we're okay.
 Well, it's actually 'cause we stopped listening
 to those a little while ago.
 You know, like we become numb and dull
 to all of the ways that we would even be able
 to receive information.
  </li><li>But that question's kind of like asking, like,
 you know, why aren't people transformed
 when they've got the Bible now and they could just read it?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>It's like, well, 'cause you have to read it,
 you have to apply it.
  </li><li>Yeah, you have to take it in,
 you have to let it change you.
 You have to.
 Yeah.
 Don't be just readers of the word, but do what it says.
 Right.
 I mean, yeah, it's entirely plausible.
 I love where you're coming from.
 What was...
 Kendra.
 Kendra's husband.
 I love where you're coming from.
 Like, hey, if God's all powerful, like, why can't He speak to us?
 Oh, He can.
 It's that we're hard of hearing.
 It's why this constant instruction is in Scripture to incline your ear.
 Right.
 To look to see what the Lord will say.
 Yes.
 God is speaking and, you know, we can ignore Him.
 The Psalmist says that the heavens declare the handy work of God, and yet many people
 don't believe that God is real, even though God is speaking and declaring His handy work
 through the stars.
 Yeah.
 Great series of questions.
 So good.
 Thank you.
 Thanks for sharing them.
 Hope those answers are helpful.
