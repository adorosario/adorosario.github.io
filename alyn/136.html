<p> I'll live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes sir.<br/>
 How the heck are you?<br/>
 Good.<br/>
 You look magnificent.<br/>
 Change.<br/>
 Should we talk about your hair?<br/>
 Let's talk about my hair.<br/>
 I went and got my hair done.<br/>
 And getting ready.<br/>
 How long does it take to get your hair done?
 About three hours.<br/>
 And what does it lead to that takes three hours?
 all kinds of stuff that I don't know. I have a lot of hair. I have a lot of hair and because they
 put highlights throughout it, it takes an enormous amount of time to do that.
 Well, it looks very pretty. Thank you. I'm very happy with it.
 You're getting ready to do a conference with Patricia King.
 I am. I saw somebody on Instagram say that they're going to go to it. They
 found out about it via your podcast. Oh, really? Yeah. Oh, cool. Very sweet.
 So you're busy preparing your head for that. Let's think about our week. I finished my series on
 blasting. You did. And left a bunch of people with some challenges. If you haven't listened to
 the last three weeks at emanate, I would encourage you to do it just because
 it challenged me to prepare it and I think it would challenge you. And I would honestly love the
 feedback. I would greatly appreciate the feedback. I think some people have been too scared to give
 give me feedback on it. Or I had some great discussions at the school with the students
 about it and solicited their feedback. But go on. Reach out to me on social media. I'd
 love to hear your thoughts on it. Perfect. We were teaching this week at the school on
 how to prepare a message. Yes, how to prepare a message. Why would we teach our students
 how to prepare a message? Because when they go on outreach, they are all going to preach
 some of them for the very first time in their whole lives. And before they go on outreach,
 actually next week, they're going to be teaching us.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yes, no big deal, right?
  </li><li>No, I think it's amazing.
  </li><li>It's super fun.
  </li><li>I'm always astonished at the quality
 of the teaching our students deliver.
  </li><li>They're always great.
  </li><li>It's wonderful to listen to them teach.
  </li><li>Yeah, but we basically teach them the ins and outs
 of how to put a message together,
 how to deliver a message,
 what are the different components,
 like just sort of give them scaffolding and framework
 and yeah.
 And then we teach them how to use Keynote,
 which is a piece of software that Apple makes,
 very similar to PowerPoint,
 but superior in every way.
 And for the first year, I had this epiphany
 because in previous years,
 I've taught students how to use it on a Mac.
 And this year, we split up,
 you taught them how to use it on a Mac,
 I taught them how to use it on an iPhone or an iPad.
 And my iOS class, the iPhone iPad,
 I was astonished at their ability.
 It didn't feel like there was any learning curve.
 everybody could do everything that I was showing them,
 everybody stayed up to speed.
 And I was like, this really is the future of computing.
  </li><li>I was very impressed with myself having to teach keynote
 when normally you teach it.
  </li><li>You use keynote just as much as I do.
  </li><li>I do, but I don't try and teach it
 and I'm definitely not as proficient as you are.
 I have to really think about what I need to do,
 but I think the advantage of that was I had to slow down
 and work through it at the pace that I work through it.
 So I think it was easy to follow.
 But I hope I think I know how competent I am at Keynote
 because I'm a competent computer user.
 So I know my limits and I know where I am on scale.
 I think that you incorrectly assess
 where you are on the scale.
 I think you think you're an incompetent Keynote user,
 but I would say you are way more competent
 than you think you are.
  </li><li>Oh, thanks, babe.
  </li><li>I think you're completely skilled.
  </li><li>Thanks, I like it.
 I like the program, I think it's fun.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Then you went and got your hair done,
 which was the highlight of the week.
  </li><li>Yep.
 No, dear.
 Actually, the highlight of the week has been in Sarah arriving.
 Yeah, our good friends from Toronto, Ben and Sarah Jackson arrived when Saturday.
 What are we today?
 Survey morning.
 They're here all week.
 We're going to try and get them on the podcast this week because we have such great conversations
 with them that I wish we were recording, but apparently it's legal without consent.
 I've heard that somewhere.
 We'll try and record them legitimately.
 Are you where it was snowing today in Nashville?
 I saw a little bit of snow when I ran out of the service to use the facilities.
 But alas, it did not stick at some point.
 I was, I was home during the second service with the kids.
 And when I looked at the window, I was astonished to see the flurry, the, the blizzard.
 That was happening.
 The lizard.
 Yeah.
 But none of it stuck.
 Wow.
 And I'm sure it was seriously disappointed.
 That's very sad.
 All right.
 Well, I hope everybody's doing super well.
 Our topic for this week came out of aforementioned said people, Benjamin and Sarah.
 I'm sure there's some big words there.
 I'm sure there's more elegant way of saying that later,
 Hosen.
 Hey, what did you want to say about later?
 Hosen.
 There's some word that Ben told us to try and use in the podcast.
 What was the word?
 Glockenspiel.
 Oh, God.
 God.
 I just feel like.
 How did you end up with later?
 Hosen.
 I don't know.
 Just how tired are you?
 I'm so tired right now and I still have to finish my ring.
 So I have, I'm gonna have to run on the spot for like two hours when we're done doing this podcast.
 Talk about the ring phenomenon.
 The ring phenomenon.
 Well, our Apple watches give us three different rings every day.
 One is for standing at least one minute of every hour, which sounds like that should be the easiest thing in the world to do,
 but it's actually possible to not get your ring.
 Because you have to get 12 hours.
 And anyway,
 Will you physically have to stand up from where you're sitting and remain standing and be active for a minute each hour which sounds ridiculous but if you're commuting or if you're stuck in traffic or if you're in a meeting where it feels weird to just stand up in the middle of it.
 Yes, I know you're bawling but I need to stand right now and wave my arm about like a freak.
 And then if today there was two hours where I didn't get any stand minutes because I hadn't sat to stand so it didn't.
 trigger that you were standing.
 Yeah, it just didn't realize I was standing,
 even though I had cooking the whole time
 and like sweeping and stuff.
 Right.
 So that's a blue ring.
 That's a blue ring.
 The green ring is.
 The green ring is exercise,
 intentional movement.
 And you need a minimum of 30 minutes
 of intentional movement every day.
 And the red ring is active calories.
 Why are you laughing at me?
 Well, it's extra.
 It's extra active calories.
 Is there a lot of extra grain on there?
  </li><li>For the green and the red rings,
 my understanding is it doesn't register those
 until your heart rate is higher than your resting heart rate.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So you don't just get them for moving around.
 You actually have to move vigorously in order to get them.
  </li><li>Yes, and the unfortunate part about that
 is my resting heart rate is quite low.
 So it takes quite a while for it to even,
 I mean, give me any sort of credit for anything.
 So here I am with all of my rings completed for the night.
 Right.
 And I have no idea how you have them.
 And I still need to get about 200 calories.
 Like I'm going to have to run around my living room, like some sort of prancing
 fool for like an hour and a half before I go to bed to get all my rings.
 But it's dedication.
 Well, I have all my rings for every day in January.
 And we get a special award if we do every day in January.
 See, it's very exciting.
 Hashtag close those rings.
 So we need to we need to wrap this up.
 Okay, longevity.
 It's a good thing.
 See ya.
 Back to our main dog.
 Right.
 Romania.
 No.
 What are we talking about?
 Romania.
 What are you on?
 All right.
 Okay.
 Let me try and talk.
 Stop talking because you're making me.
 This ladies and gentlemen is what ages like when she's
 delirious from tiredness.
 Okay, I can do this.
 Good day.
 Okay.
 We were out for dinner with our friend, Sarah and Ben.
 Yes.
 And I realized that you've known Sarah for nearly 20 years.
 Yes.
 And we've known Ben for almost 10 years.
 Yes.
 Maybe 10 years in the nose.
 And I realized so we've known each other for a long time.
 Actually, we were part of helping them get together.
 We were.
 Yeah, we anyway, that's not the point of tonight's topic.
 So maybe we could tell that later.
 Okay.
 So we've known them for almost 10 years.
 And we've shared lives together despite living in different countries.
 We do see each other once or maybe twice a year.
 And we've loved watching them grow in God and loved watching God grow in them.
 And so I commented to them last night that guys we've shared life together for over
 10 years.
 We've got lots of shared friends as well.
 And I commented on how I've seen them grow in the Lord.
 And yeah, also with great sadness, I've seen other people that perhaps mutual friends
 of ours not keep growing in God.
 Either remaining stagnant or worse stepped away from the Lord or regressed or are now
 no longer walking with the Lord at all.
 And I got to thinking like, why is it some people keep going with the Lord and some people
 don't?
 Like, especially the people that we've, the people that I was thinking, and I have to
 be very, very careful that we're not in judgment here.
 And I have to check my heart that I'm not, but we've all had these same experiences.
 You know, we've all, especially in Toronto, seen revival, seen the same miracles, encountered
 the glory of God, and yet some people are no longer walking with the Lord.
 So why do some people go on with a Lord and some people don't?
 Any thoughts on that?
 I would imagine, or I guess from what I've observed, most of the people I think that
 don't seem to carry on with the Lord in some sort of visible relationship.
 There's been some sort of wounding or something that's happened that hasn't been dealt with.
 And as a result of that, there's been either bitterness or something that's grown up and
 that has been fostered instead of keeping clear accounts and that sort of thing.
 Jeff, was it last week or was it a couple of weeks ago?
 It was the first message of Emily of the year and then he spoke the message again for
 whole body at Grace Center. And he talked about this phenomenon where we can be offended at God.
 An amazing message, super profound. But when you say that you see hurt to happen, do you mean
 people get hurt at God? Something doesn't pan out the way they want or they get disappointed in God?
 And that derails them or do you mean with people?
 I mean both. So sometimes we've laid something at God's feet that we've become offended and so
 that's it. You know, like what? I'm out. Things didn't go the way we planned. You know,
 I'm not married yet and I thought I would be, you know, I thought life would look like this by now
 or I'm not living the dream or, you know, whatever the thing is. And we're holding God hostage
 about whatever that thing is. To perform our will.
 Yeah, and the truth is God loves the desires of our hearts.
 But often we blame God for things that aren't his fault at all, but we can't necessarily recognize
 that during that season. So those sort of things. And then also just people that
 we get offended with church leadership or whatever the thing is and foster that and it becomes a
 reason to disconnect. I think that there is a fallacy in the church that we think that
 the key to longevity with God is an encounter with God. Now, I'm all for encounters. I absolutely
 am for all for encounters. But even as a young boy always amazed me that the Israelites had
 one of the most spectacular theories of encounters with the Lord ever, like their deliverance
 from Egypt, for example, the parting of the Red Sea, the great exodus.
 I mean, seeing all those amazing signs and wonders, pillars of smoke, pillars of fire,
 just signs wonders everywhere.
 Right.
 And then the next chapter, Moses goes to be with the Lord, the leader goes to be with
 the Lord, and by the time Moses comes back, they start building false idols.
 I don't like it.
 How the heck does that happen?
 And yet it's not that different from our own lives.
  </li><li>Sure, we do it all the time.
 We just, it's not as obvious as a large golden calf.
  </li><li>But I've seen people, I mean, we run a school.
 So we've seen this firsthand,
 but we've also, you and I have both done schools.
 You've done YWAM, I did Toronto.
 You go to school, you see these amazing students
 have encountered with God,
 and then maybe 10 years later, you're wondering,
 "Oh, I wonder what's happened to some zone?"
 you look him up on Facebook and you're like, "Ah, how did we get to here now?" So it's
 a strange dynamic when you realize people who have been touched by God no longer want
 to walk with God. But I guess it's found all the way through Scripture as well.
 Sure it is. It's not that uncommon. But the other thing is we know tons and tons of people
 that are still walking with the Lord and have amazing dynamic growing relationships from
 those same seasons.
 So let's talk about that then.
 So I'm all for events.
 I just think if we only live for events, then we don't learn how to live between events.
 So my question then is let's think about the people we have observed, who have rich,
 flourishing relationships with God over time.
 For example, I remember Bill Johnson, and maybe it was Chris Valtin when he was with
 us, he just said, "I run a school.
 I have learned from how many years have been around the school, from X number of years,
 of seeing the students that burn the brightest don't necessarily burn the longest.
 So he said, "I stopped being impressed by the students who were like, 'Ah, all these
 miracles, look at all these tests from these.'
 He said, 'I have found that the students who are just quiet and dutiful and get on with
 what they need to do, that five, six, seven years later, they have a rich, mature relationship
 with the Lord. And sometimes the people who were flash in the pans are not even welcome
 with the Lord anymore.
 Right.
 So let me ask you this. In the lives of people who've got a rich history with God, what are
 the key ingredients of their relationship with God that you've seen deployed over years?
 It's probably a number of things. I think the people that I've observed, particularly
 from Toronto are pretty tooled up to be able to deal with life in terms of walking through
 issues and confrontations and that kind of stuff and being able to survive them without
 withdrawing. Give me some examples of what you mean by that.
 I mean, being part of a church is being part of a family and family has conflict that's part of it.
 And so not in the moments of conflict with drawing
 and just upping and, you know,
 well, I'm gonna find a new church
 or I'm just gonna give up on church
 or whatever the thing is, but actually going,
 all right, I'm gonna choose to forgive.
 I'm gonna choose to believe the best.
 I'm also gonna go and have a powerful conversation.
 You know, like all those kind of things
 that you're tooled up to be able to be part of a family
 and be life to other people.
  </li><li>Well, it was like Dan said last week
 that we learn to disagree without divorce.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Where I can be connected to you even if I disagree with you.
 That's such a powerful life skill.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And you already talked about one of the reasons
 that we walk away from the Lord is being offended by him.
 So probably conversely learning not to be offended
 with God is a key to growth.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Although I wonder sometimes if people that are actually
 offended with God are able to recognize that's what it is.
 Or if they think they're offended with men,
 but they're actually offended with God.
  </li><li>I wonder too, because presumably one of the most
 preposterous states we could find ourselves in
 is being aware that we're offended at God
 and assuming we are right.
  </li><li>Well, don't we always assume we're right?
  </li><li>But what I mean to be aware of that,
 like hi, I'm God.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You're offended at me.
 Should we talk about that?
 I mean, who in the right mind is gonna have that
 cognitive awareness that, oh, I'm offended with God,
 surely he must be wrong, why doesn't he see my point of view?
  </li><li>Well, I think it's actually faulty theology.
 It's not so much that we're offended because we're trying to be offended.
 We're offended because we think God is the author of our pain.
 So I think it's because we don't actually understand him, understand his heart for us,
 understand how he works, understand things like what the enemy is responsible for and
 what God's responsible for in terms of the things that happen in our lives.
 Then we lay things at God's, at his feet that actually have nothing to do with him and we're
 mad.
 great language, has most of us follow God up until the point that His will contradicts our will.
 Maturity, I think, I look at people, I think it was Derek Prince who said, "I've never trusted
 a man who doesn't walk with a limp." I think all of us go through a season where we have something
 happening in life that we can't reconcile with the theology we currently have. And yet, if we're
 If we're going to go on with God, we have to say, even though I don't understand, I still trust you.
 Yeah.
 And when we get over that hurdle, we might not get an understanding of it, but we've reconciled
 in our heart.
 Okay, God, I'm filing this away in mystery.
 I'm choosing to believe you're still good, even though my circumstances might not have
 suggested that.
 And I'm banking that that's all we're going to come clear as I continue to walk with you.
 When I see people who've got longevity in their relationship with God, I guarantee you
 that's happened to them one or more times.
 And you listen to them and you say, "Hey, help me understand your process.
 How did you keep your heart right with that?"
 And I think that was one of the things that most attracted to me about you, babe.
 I remember listening to your testimony and I'm just thinking, "How are you so radiant?"
 all of the things that have happened to you, why are you not broken? At best, why are you not crawling across the finish line?
 But here you were in another country from that pain that you'd grown up with.
 And I remember just thinking, "Well, how are you so majestic? How are you so radiant? How are you so overflowing with peace and with joy?
 And you're not bitter, you're not sarcastic, you're not caustic.
 How have you done that?
 And it was so attractive.
 I was just like, I need to get inside your orbit to work out.
 And of course, it's everything you're talking about now, the gift of forgiveness, choosing
 God even when it doesn't make sense.
 I think too, God placed me in a family.
 Scripture says he places the lonely in families.
 God placed me in a family in Toronto, and I let them be family.
 And even though family was a scary word for me, family became a healing word for me.
 But I think partially, like when you say, what are some of the things that help or contribute
 towards longevity, I would say teachableness and letting other people love you, call you
 on your stuff, help you grow.
 Those are all things that will actually make it so that your relationship with alert continues
 to grow doesn't become a stagnant thing that becomes somehow boring because it feels the
 same as it did last year.
 We've talked about this before in the podcast and I want to make sure I say this right,
 but without a doubt, everybody that I know who's encountered calamity that they haven't
 bounced back from, the one thing they all have in common is in previous seasons of their
 life, they stop going to church.
 So I'm not saying that everybody who stopped going to church has ended up in calamity,
 but everybody that I've personally been involved in where their life has been derailed either
 morally or in their relationship with God or some level of crisis.
 Right.
 Financially, whatever.
 All of them at one point stop going to church.
 And I remember asking the Lord about that.
 Like, whoa.
 So whenever I see people step away from the church, I'm always quick to rush to them and
 say, "Hey, I know where this ends."
 And right now it probably doesn't look like it right now.
 It's just like, "Oh my gosh, Sunday's to myself.
 This is amazing."
 And actually I can still have a relationship with God.
 And God says...
 And go to nice coffee stores.
 And what you're experiencing right now is spring break.
 If you quit your job for the first week or so, it would be like, "Awesome.
 This is amazing.
 I have to get up in the morning.
 You would love it.
 But then sooner or later, your world would crumble because you need to go to work in order
 to derive an income.
 Now, I'm not trying to stretch that analogy too far with church, but just every time I've
 seen people make a deliberate decision to stop going to church, I rush to them and just
 say, "Guys, can I encourage you that no good thing is going to come from this?
 Can I read your passage?"
 Ephesians 4 verse 11 says this, "These are the gifts Christ gave to the church, the apostles,
 the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers. Their responsibility is to equip God's
 people to do His work and build up the church, the body of Christ." So here's what's crazy about
 that is where you get equipped to do God's work and where you are built up and where you reach
 maturity is only in the church. Yeah. So scripture is really clear. If you remove yourself from
 the church is what happens is you won't be equipped to do God's work, nor will you be built up.
 You don't notice not being built up until a period of time has passed. Right. Right.
 So I've got friends who go to the gym every day, like our neighbor Brett is in the gym all
 the day and he looks like it. If he skipped gym for a day, nobody would notice. He might notice,
 but I wouldn't know this, but if he stops going to the gym for a couple of months,
 I'm going to notice. And I think it's the same thing where, you know, Paul goes on in verse 13,
 he says, "This will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God's
 Son that we will be mature in the Lord, measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ."
 I don't know about our definition of longevity than being mature in the Lord,
 measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ. But Paul is saying, if you want maturity,
 you need to stay in the church. Yeah, again, there's no plan B.
 Right. Very next verse, his contrast is, "Then we will no longer be immature like children."
 Well, I mean, even finish that. It says, "We won't be tossed and blown by every wind of new teaching,
 and we will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so clever that they sound
 like the truth. That's the thing is when you're not part of the church and you're not in church,
 you're not hearing the word as part of a body, you're not digesting it all together, all that
 kind of stuff. It leaves you open to strange winds of doctrine and that kind of stuff. And you
 don't even realize until you're halfway down the lake that you're being blown by a wind that
 wasn't life. Right. And I think that's the thing where we've come across people who have
 literally shipwrecked their life. And once upon a time they were godly people, they were
 devoted followers of Jesus. Like in some cases, I'm talking about people who are missionaries
 or pastors or people who you just look at and just think, "Oh my gosh, you're totally going
 after God." And now they're like, "Eh, I'm not even sure Jesus is the way to God. I'm not even
 sure the Bible is in Aaron and you're just like, you know, how did you get to that place?
 And I trace it back to what you're saying, you know, fence, but primarily removing themselves
 from church thinking, I don't need to be in the church. Well, and usually it's because of some
 sort of hurt, which is not something that typically we recognize until way later on, you know, like,
 "Oh, actually I said I left the church because it felt like life to me and I felt like God was
 speaking to me about it and blah blah." But in the end, usually when those people come back,
 they realize they left out of offense. Sometimes it takes a while for us to recognize what was
 actually happening in our own hearts. I mean, that's not that unusual. You think about just
 the normal day situations. I often am slow to catch up with what's going on in my own heart.
 Right.
 So.
 Lyle Phillips, our good friend, Lyle and Allison Pastor, legacy Nashville.
 On Twitter a while back, Lyle wrote this.
 He said, "When I became a pastor, I was not prepared to watch people that I love walk away from God.
 It's by far the hardest thing about the job."
 It is by far the hardest thing.
 And I was reading around that time when he tweeted that third John, chapter one verse four, he says,
 "Again, this Father in the faith is saying, 'I have no greater joy than to hear that my children
 are walking in the truth. And that's true. Nothing gives me greater joy than to hear of those who
 are continuing to walk with God. And yeah, at the same time, nothing gives me greater sorrow than
 here in the opposite. Well, it's the thing we've cried over the most in the last nine years.
 So hard. So longevity. Yeah. Guys, if you're listening to this, we want to see you run a long
 faithful walk with God. And so how do we summarize this, babe?
 Find a body of believers.
 Devote yourself to them.
 Yeah.
 And recognize you're not going to find a perfect church with perfect leaders, but ask
 Lord to help you find a healthy place where you can grow and you can become part of a
 family.
 Keep your heart free of offense from both people and God.
 Yep.
 Develop faithfulness.
 Yep.
 I mean, that's longevity and practice is you being faithful and obey God, I think.
 Yeah.
 Stay teachable.
 There's our list.
 There you go.
 That's longevity.
 I've got a brilliant listeners question.
 I've never been asked this before and I think you're going to have tremendous insight.
 You ready?
 Okay, pressure.
 Yeah, I'm ready.
 This is from Ellie.
 Hi, Ellie.
 Hi, Alan and AJ.
 I'm listening to your podcast and loving it.
 That's good.
 Thank you, Ellie.
 Sissy Pfeiffer recommended it.
 I'm so glad you did.
 Thank you, Sissy.
 The podcast has really inspired me and I'm thinking and praying of doing one on my own.
 What would be some advice for someone thinking about starting their own podcast?
 Well, I feel funny answering it because really you do all the legwork and I just sit here
 rather and talk for a bit.
 Right, but I mean, I think that what you just said, there sums up the two sides of it.
 Is all the legwork in the world won't be good if you don't have something worth saying.
 Well, that's true.
 And having something worth saying is almost pointless if you don't do the legwork to
 make it sound good.
 Right.
 So there's two things.
 Have a life-giving message.
 And make it interesting to listen to it.
 And we've struggled with that, haven't we?
 Because we're like, "Oh my gosh, why would anybody want to listen to us talk?"
 Yes.
 I was shocked anybody wanted to.
 You have to push that idea away from you because that's the biggest lie of the enemy
 that says you don't have a message worth hearing.
 Right.
 My encouragement would be is find podcasts you like listening to and then work out what
 is it about it that you like listening to.
 So one of my favorite podcasts is a podcast called ATP, accidental tech podcast, three
 nerds who get together every week and talk.
 When you listen to it, babe, you're like, what are you listening to?
 I hate this.
 Turn it off.
 Well, the tones of their voices don't really work for me.
 And you're just not interested in the content.
 No.
 So, well, I mean, most of it sounds like they might as well be speaking German.
 I have no idea.
 But what I love about them is it feels like I'm eavesdropping to people I would normally
 have never access to and they're talking about something that interests me.
 And so their podcast inspired our podcast in that, in that we designed this to be the
 kind of conversation you would have if you were having dinner.
 Like literally, the conversation we just had tonight about longevity is pretty much the
 conversation we had last night with Ben and Sarah.
 That's the first thing.
 and then do a little bit of research. I'll put some links in the show notes to some people
 that really help me about buying equipment. You don't have to break the bank for it,
 but putting a little bit of effort in learning how to capture what you're saying so it sounds good.
 Because you might have a brilliant message, but our ears are very, very picky. We're used to
 listening to really good quality, well recorded stuff. And when you have to listen to badly
 I believe record this stuff, no matter how good the message,
 you're nobody's are gonna want to cross that hurdle.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think too though, babe, when you say,
 put in a little bit of effort,
 you don't put in a little bit of effort,
 you put in a lot of effort.
 So if you think about every podcast that we record,
 probably is about seven hours worth of your effort
 between-- - I don't think it's that much.
  </li><li>Sure it is, babe.
 It's like an hour of prep beforehand
 while I'm doing food and doing stuff with the kids.
  </li><li>Maybe half of now.
 Okay, and then we record for about an hour
 and then you do all the show notes, all the editing,
 all that stuff, that's another three or four hours afterwards.
 Yeah, maybe three hours, so maybe four and a half hours.
 At a minimum.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 So I would say like, have an idea of how often you wanna do this
 in a realistic amount of time that it's gonna take
 because it takes you four and a half hours
 with logic and all those kind of things,
 but those are programs that you're all familiar with.
  </li><li>Logic is a piece of software rather than a mental approach.
  </li><li>Logic is a piece of software that he used to edit.
 But all I'm saying is, you know, it's, yeah,
 it's not as easy as it sounds on one level.
 Like I would say go for it,
 but just be aware of the time commitment going in as well.
  </li><li>I also think we didn't discover this
 until we decided to do it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But I was doing some research
 There's a brilliant guy, Sean McCabe, who has a website called SeanWest.com.
 I'll put a link to that.
 There's a guy, part of his network, called a podcast dude, who's very, very helpful.
 If you want to learn the behind the scenes of how to do a podcast, it's an excellent podcast.
 He was saying, "If you're going to start something, make a weekly commitment to it because people's
 lives run in weekly commitments."
 If you're just going to do a podcast once every now and then, record an episode when
 you feel like it, you will not build traction because nobody's going to commit to something
 that you're not committed to doing.
 I think part of the traction that we have is every Monday pretty much come rain or shine.
 There is something and it's there have been a few times in the last couple of years where
 it hasn't been there because we were sick or we're traveling or whatever.
 We try to think ahead with that and we've committed to doing a weekly podcast so that
 when we show up each week, our listeners show up each week.
 Right.
 So that's something to think about too, but there's, there's so much
 material on the web about doing podcasts.
 I'll put a couple of starter articles for you to read in your
 podcast.
 And again, if you've got more questions, Ellie, be more than
 happy to answer them.
 You can just email us via our website.
 Speaking of our website, if you would like the show notes, you
 can go to alananaj.com/136.
 Nice.
 That's the thing. If you are ever listening to any of our episodes,
 if you always go to Alan and AJ.com/ and put in the episode number,
 you'll always get the show notes for that episode.
 And if you've just recently started this into our podcast, Alan is spelled A-L-Y-N.
 It's a Welsh spelling that I'm actually quite grateful because it means I can always
 get a unique username on social media platforms.
 I mean, that's the main reason they use that spelling, I'm sure.
 Yeah, my parents were so...
 Just ahead of the time.
 Yeah, there's so much force.
 It's amazing.
 If you would like to ask us a question
 that you would like us to answer on air, again,
 go to <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/ask.
 And just like Ellie discovered our podcast
 by her friend Sissy telling her about it,
 it would do us a tremendous favor
 if you would not only recommend our podcast
 to people you think that might like to listen to,
 but if you would leave us a review,
 go to <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/review
 and it will take you automatically
 to the iTunes page where you could leave a review.
 It is amazing to me that every time we ask for a review,
 we always get reviews.
 And it is hugely helpful in letting other people
 know about our podcast on the iTunes network.
  </li><li>Should I tell them how to spell AJ as well?
 Or do you think it's probably okay?
 I mean, I have gotten some cards with it spelled A,
 J, A, Y, but you know, just to clarify,
 it's just two initials.
  </li><li>And there's no silent P.
  </li><li>There's no silent P, there's no silent P.
 (laughs)
 Very funny.
  </li><li>All right, you guys are wonderful.
 Thanks for tuning in this week.
 We will be back next week with more of the same.
 Have a great week.
 Faith, Life, Communication, Tacos and Video Games
 Pale you donuts and the kindness of God
 But things we deal with every day
 From Franklin to Tennessee
 They are just like you and me
 Alan, and AJ
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 Sharing their life, experience it
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 They talk about faith in God
 And everything under the sun
 If you are a human being
 There's something here for everyone
 Okay, so what is it you want to talk about?
 I'm talking about how you get injured.
 Alright, how are the different ways you get injured?
 So this is how you get injured.
 If something is a metal, it should touch it.
 You'll be injured and then you die.
 And then after that, she got in the Holy Spirit and Jesus and nobody else.
 Oh, you just see those guys?
 Yeah.
 Mm-hmm.
 Let's talk about rescue bots.
 What's your favorite rescue bot?
 Eat life and hide toys and optimists and chase and blaze and brutal and selfish and
 bull and bumblebee and nobody else.
 Oh wow, is there anything else you want to talk about in the podcast?
 Yeah.
 What?
 Um, Jonah and the big fish.
 Tell me about Jonah and the big fish.
 I haven't heard that story.
 So, Jesus talked to Jonah and then he...
 What did Jesus say to Jonah?
 He said, "Go to Nineveh by then."
 So...
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
 Why didn't Jonah go to Nineveh?
 I don't know.
 Oh, he didn't go.
 So, he sent a big fish that eaten for three days and three nights.
 So Jonah was inside the big fish for three days and three nights.
 Yeah, and then he spit him out.
 The fish spat Jonah out onto the ground.
 Like pfft.
 Wow.
 And then what happened?
 And then he jumps back in the water.
 Uh-huh.
 And then he eat fishes.
 Wow.
 Because when he's in the water, he has that big, big chunk of kryptonite.
 and then he can swim in the water and then his head on the green to red, the mad, to
 shed, to angry, to happy.
 I don't remember that exact version in the Bible.
 Are you reading from the message?
 No, I read in a different book.
 Oh, a different book.
 Yes.
 And then did Jonah go and speak to Nineveh?
 Yes.
 And what did he say to them?
 Um, hey, this sideboard won't angry, so you don't don't be angry and you have to stop and then
 or else
 um, Jesus will blow so burn so do not so
 Jonas said to them you got to stop being angry
 And if you don't jesus gonna break your city
 Yes, and and what did they stop being angry? Yes, it's a great story. Bye. Bye everybody
 Thank you for listening to this podcast.
