<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll live in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>AJ Jones. - Yes.
  </li><li>And we're back from vacation.
  </li><li>We are?
  </li><li>I love the way you're all dressed in pink
 and I'm dressed in gray.
  </li><li>Well, right before we recorded,
 you were going back through the little thumbnails
 of all of the previous eight recordings or whatever.
 And I was wondering what you were doing
 and you were checking to make sure you weren't
 wearing the same outfit.
  </li><li>Well, the problem with that is I only own like seven shirts.
 So I've already, you know,
 I've already worn this gray shirt,
 but what do we discover about your shirt?
  </li><li>We discovered that I pretty much wear the same outfit
 every week.
  </li><li>You don't, you wear the same color.
  </li><li>The same color, I wear the same color of green,
 but I have worn the same outfit that I did have on
 this morning, I was already,
 and I was just waiting for him.
 And then I realized I'd worn that shirt twice.
  </li><li>But you're green, you wear a lot of green
 'cause it goes with your eyes.
  </li><li>Yeah, and I like green as my favorite color.
  </li><li>I wear a lot of gray 'cause it goes with my hair.
  </li><li>Yes, it does.
 Yummy.
  </li><li>Can't make the stuff up, magic's still alive.
  </li><li>Yeah, and he's wearing shorts,
 which is very distracting for me
 'cause I can just reach under here and feel his knee.
  </li><li>Not distracting for me at all.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Really go ahead, tell us about vacation.
  </li><li>So last week.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Last week we went away camping,
 which is, you know, for those of you
 been listening to podcasts for a while,
 other than the camping's revelation to me.
 But this time we took our camping to a level
 I did not imagine.
 We went RVing.
  </li><li>We did.
  </li><li>I will admit, when we pulled in,
 initially I was like, oh dear God,
 what have I signed up for?
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>Yeah, all the RVs, I was like, I feel a little bit.
  </li><li>Like not to our site, but like into the campground.
  </li><li>Yeah, I feel to realize that my wife,
 in all her shape, her goodness had picked,
 you know, the best campsite ever.
 Literally.
 So we were completely secluded.
 Yes.
 But it was a little bit of a cultural awakening when I drove in and saw all these
 RVs. Yes.
 And I think we can best sum up as our seven year old son.
 I said to MJ, bro, how do you like RV?
 And he's like, I like it.
 Kind of feels like we're cheating on camping though.
 I said, why?
 He's like, well, we're in a box with Wi-Fi.
 I was like, yeah.
 Yeah.
 But I, I mean, I loved it.
 It's the first time that we've RVed and I have great aspirations about taking family trips with
 an RV, but I just wasn't sure what that would be like. And now I feel even more confident that
 I would like to do that. Yeah, we just rented one. Yeah, we rented an RV. And the guy that we
 rented up from was lovely. So he brought it and he set it up at the park for us. And it was great
 'cause you get to sleep with air conditioning,
 and the kids all had their own beds
 as opposed to being on inflatable mattresses
 that always let the air out.
 And so everybody slept great, didn't matter that it rained,
 didn't matter that we had raccoons that kept visiting us.
  </li><li>Yeah, like are raccoons dangerous
 because they were not frightened of us at all?
  </li><li>I mean, I've always thought that they could be aggressive,
 but these didn't seem aggressive.
 Like they just came right up to us.
  </li><li>They didn't care about the fire,
 they didn't care about me making dog noises.
 daylight. Nope. They came in the daylight to come check out our campsite.
 Yeah, that was, that was not great. But it's like all the benefits of camping.
 So you're outside fresh air, campfire, s'mores,
 hammock,
 waste,
 floor life with all the benefits of being a home,
 AC Wi-Fi electricity.
 Refrigerators. Yeah.
 Ice. Yeah. It was great. The only thing that was really funny was the,
 the camper that we rented, the air conditioning event was right kind of
 above our heads.
 And so Alan was super excited because he was like, I'm getting AC and this is great.
 And I had to.
 AJ slept with a fleece zipped up.
 I'm like, this is awesome.
 Go because it was blowing right down my neck.
 Yeah.
 So anyway, it was awesome.
 I loved it.
 I want to do it again.
 Two thumbs up.
 Yeah.
 Also, like that we had two LCD TVs, so we could play the switch in either the living room or our bedroom.
 We did. Yeah.
 So yeah, camping plus Nintendo.
 I'm a happy man. It was great. Well done.
 And you planned that whole thing, execute it. It was excellent.
 Thank you. Thank you.
 You were not confident it was going to be good.
 I think I had suspicions.
 Like I've never ran an RV before the first place, not the place we actually rented the RV from,
 but the first place seemed a little sketchy to me.
 Like their insurance.
 I was like, you know, so I was really happy.
 We kind of used like the Airbnb of RVs.
 Yeah, we used something called outdoorsy.
 Word, great.
 Yep.
 Yeah.
 So good.
 Oh, and our air conditioning is fixed.
 So we came back to a cool, quiet, calm house praise, Jesus.
 Yeah.
 And you said it's quieter, a new unit.
 Yeah.
 Root weight quieter.
 Okay.
 Our old unit was like 14 years ago.
 And I think it was like a bunch of hamsters in a stone wheel.
 When it would come on, it would go, whoa.
  </li><li>I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, yeah.
 It was not good.
 That was my impersonation of our air conditioning unit.
 This is the podcast magic you sign up for.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>So we've been doing a series based on a book
 by DoctorThip.called Voice of the Heart
 and the eight feelings that we have done are?
  </li><li>Oh sure, put me on the spot.
 Our eight feelings are her lonely, sad, angry,
 fear, shame, guilt and glad.
  </li><li>Well done. - Thank you.
 almost like I have a little notepad right here.
  </li><li>I cheated, but I'll let it go.
  </li><li>I know them, I just can't recall them.
 This is like kind of the story of my life.
  </li><li>And you've been looking at the little piece of paper
 for a couple of years now, once a week.
  </li><li>I know, every week, look at that piece of paper,
 I still, you know.
  </li><li>I still pull it up on my phone.
  </li><li>To work out what they are?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Yeah, me too.
 Anyway, we've been doing these eight feelings,
 we've been talking about them.
 "Dard of Chip Dog", the author of the book
 that we've been studying,
 is gonna be on the podcast with us next week.
 We're really excited about that.
 He's gonna be answering the questions
 that you have sent us. If you would like to send us more, go to allenanagia.com/ask
 and we'll make sure that we ask him your questions.
 So as we've been doing this series, we've discovered that every feeling has a gift
 and an impairment.
 Yep. Gift if you actually feel your feelings.
 Yep.
 An impairment if you refuse to.
 Yep.
 And we've discovered that actually all of the feelings, even though some of them
 sound bad are really, really good and they're essential for full-hearted living.
 Yeah. So we've talked about them.
 Yep.
 But let's move from talking about them to what are we supposed to do with them?
 The big question that people listen to the podcast,
 or they read the book and go, right?
 And we'll now walk.
 Well, that's what this episode was about.
 It's about how to feel your feelings, which sounds insane that we need to be taught
 how to feel our feelings.
 But I mean, from my own experience, it took me till I was in my early 40s before
 I discovered that you need to feel your feelings.
 Yeah.
 And at first, it was an alien process because I didn't think I had any.
 Let me start with this brilliant line from Chipps book.
 Feeling our feelings is about beginning to take responsibility for the content of our hearts.
 It requires us to live out of how our hearts are made and use our feelings to experience and add to relationships.
 First with ourselves, then with others.
 So here's where perhaps the most important thing about feelings comes into play.
 We're stuck with them.
 Yes.
 I used to think like I think my journey with this was being convinced that we have feelings being convinced to feeling your feelings is good and then thinking okay you've convinced me if I feel my feelings then I'll no longer have to deal with my feelings.
 Like if I sit through the process of feeling my feelings and magically my feelings will go away and I want to do this stupid process anymore.
 And that's not how it works that's not how it works yeah I think the first place to start is to actually submit to how we're actually made which is an emotional.
 emotional and spiritual being with feelings that are a gift from God to allow us to live
 fully when life becomes tragic.
 Yeah, Chip says that line, "Life is tragic, but God is faithful."
 I hate that line.
 When I heard him first say that, I was like, "No, life is not tragic because God is good,
 therefore life is good."
 And what I realized is I don't want to live life on life's terms.
 Like I want my revelation of the goodness of God to protect me from ever having a bad
 life, like having anything negative happen to me. And I'm realizing that's an unrealistic
 way of looking at life.
 Yes, we live in a fallen world.
 And we live with tragedy.
 Yes.
 But what I've since come to learn is that because God is good, He's going to be with us no
 matter what shape life comes in, like good, bad or ugly. We have access to the presence
 of God and actually our feelings allow us to be present with God with all the bad things
 happen and allow his goodness and his presence to be with us as we go through those horrible,
 negative things. Right. So basically the gift of feeling allows us to move near God and feel his
 presence in the midst of whatever is going on. Yeah, because if you think about it, it's very hard
 to record that God's called a comforter for a reason, which means we would need comforting.
 So if we're like, no, I'm good. I don't need comforting. We've really got no use for the
 the Holy Spirit. Well not just the Holy Spirit, the Father and Jesus also call themselves
 comforters. Right. So yes, we have a problem. Or when Jesus says, "Come on to me, you who
 are weary and heavy laden." We're like, "No, I'm good." Yes. So the whole premise of being
 with God is that we are weak and in need of God. The whole thing of God dwelling among
 us is He wants to be near us. And somehow I've missed that. I'm thinking God wants to be
 nearest when, you know, to empower us to do good works, go
 once to be nearest, you know, yeah, yeah, if we stumble and
 fall, he's gonna lift us up so we get back on the race. But
 the truth is, he wants to be with us because he loves us and
 he created us with feelings.
 Yeah, it makes me think of that verse, babe, which I think is
 Matthew 23, about Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who killed the
 prophets and stone those who are sent to you. How often I long
 to gather you together in my arms, but you are not willing.
 And I just thought, yeah, we're so often not willing,
 even though God actually wants to connect with us
 and comfort us and meet us where we're at,
 he's looking for our willingness to do that.
  </li><li>Yeah, in our fear and our anxiety and our rage,
 we'd rather stone those that God sent us, sent to us,
 than actually be with him in our fear
 and in our shame, in our sadness.
 I was thinking about sadness, like tomorrow's Father's Day,
 we're recording this Saturday, tomorrow's Father's Day. We both have significant stories
 around our Father's Day. So we're talking about life is tragic. Yep. And God is faithful.
 Life is tragic. God is good. For me, like my dad's not here. And so Father's Day brings up
 feelings about like, oh, my father's not here. I'm now confronted with thinking about my father.
 I'm thinking about what I didn't get from my dad, what I really want. I'm thinking about, oh,
 it's too late to do anything about that. So there's feelings around that and I think historically
 what I would do is well there's no point feeling about it. He's dead. He's not coming back. I can't
 have what I want. So let's just suck up and move on. Right. Right. Which I've now discovered there's
 another option, but it requires me to feel my sadness. Yeah. Right. Which is all about the loss
 of my father. It requires me to feel my anger, my passion about what I want from a father,
 what in some cases I didn't get from a father. And it invites the father, heavenly father,
 into those scenarios to be with me. So I'm more fully alive. But guess what? I don't get my dad back.
 Yeah. Guess what? I don't get what I wanted. But the father gets to be with me and there's
 something immeasurable about that. And PS I get to flourish through the sadness of that.
 Yeah, we were talking yesterday a little bit about this.
 You know, Father's Day for me also very painful. Realizing I have emotion
 right now, even just talking about it. But because my dad killed himself on Father's Day,
 and it also happens to be his birthday tomorrow on Father's Day, there's a whole bunch of emotion
 riding in on tomorrow. And I realize I can previous years, what I've tried to do is kind of
 shut down, just not feel it. Certainly before marrying you, I just didn't acknowledge Father's Day.
 And then once we started having kids, there's the challenge of I want to celebrate you as a dad,
 but it's such a painful day. And some years or better than others, I think last year actually
 was better this year. I'm already like, wow, I feel a mess about tomorrow. So am I going to just
 choose to feel how I feel and trust that God's going to get me through it and everything's going
 to be okay or am I going to shut down those are my options. Right. Do you get to be with yourself
 and in doing so invite God to be with you or do you get to move straight to denial? Pretend it's
 not there. Probably rage at your kids because they're demanding that you be present with like
 that's your two options. Are you going to be fully alive and feel your sadness or are you going to
 to move to protection and have fallout for everybody around you.
 Yeah.
 Or just completely shut down from the day and actually not celebrate at all.
 Right.
 Which tends to be actually what we both do in not really knowing, yeah, not knowing how
 to celebrate well or being in a season where we're learning to celebrate well.
 Historically, I will, I'll say for myself, I will just sort of shut down and be able
 be a shadow of myself for the day to survive it.
  </li><li>Right, which feels horrible because I feel lonely with you.
 The kids probably feel lonely with you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then we were talking about this,
 like the importance of like both of us suck at celebration.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Just generally speaking, we're not good.
 And I'm not trying to blame my culture or blame my parents
 at all, I'm not good at celebration.
 But I'm realizing in me and you not being good at celebrating,
 we're perpetuating that because we're not teaching our kids
 how to celebrate and thus be celebrated.
 Like for me, Father's Day growing up,
 my dad was like, "Oh, you know, it's just like a,
 you know, it's just a thing made up by hallmarks."
 It's no different from any other day.
 Like my dad refused to be celebrated for being a father.
 So I learned, well, don't make a big fuss
 about being a father.
 And so now I'm watching my kids,
 they're getting all excited about making a cake
 and making me breakfast.
 And the temptation is just like, you know,
 don't do that because it makes me have feelings
 about me as a dad.
 Whereas instead, I'm like, no, actually, I love your passion to celebrate your father.
 I just love that so happens to be me.
 You know, and it's more important that they learn how to celebrate.
 Also, more important that I understand I am worthy of being celebrated
 because I am a dad with glorious gifts and incredible limitations.
 Yes.
 So our point in sharing all of that was not like a big boo-hoo about Father's Day.
 The point rather was life is tragic.
 It is.
 God is faithful.
 Yeah.
 There's goodness to be found when you feel your feelings in the midst of sadness,
 in the midst of tragedy, in the midst of heartache and brokenness.
 And good comes from it.
 Like hopefully our kids will grow up knowing how to celebrate and be celebrated.
 Yeah.
 And in the process, our hearts will get healed as we learn to celebrate.
 Yeah.
 I hope all of that made sense.
 We yes, but hopefully I was thinking about the gift I got last week, the picture
 that somebody sent me.
 I remember one of our students, a friend of ours,
 sent a word art.
 I guess that's what you call them, wouldn't it?
  </li><li>You say word art, and I think about Microsoft word art.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>And I shift.
  </li><li>Oh, no, not that, but like a nice handwriting,
 hand lettering, with the words,
 all my life, you have been faithful.
 And I think it's from that Bethel song.
 I'm sure that line has been other places as well,
 But when that song came out, I remember just,
 I would listen to it over and over,
 and I was like, yeah, that's me, all my life.
 You've been faithful.
 And I was even talking about it this morning
 on the with the Finding Father group,
 that I'm sure there's people that could look at my life
 and go, you know, no, he hasn't.
 Look at your testimony.
 You know, look at what you've been through,
 but my heart really does feel all my life.
 He's been faithful, but I think that's because
 he's healed the places where there's been a disconnect,
 you know, like, and where I've needed to know where he was
 and that sort of thing.
 So yeah, wow, what a process.
 So this morning I was listening to my testimony
 while I was getting ready to host a call,
 which sounds really funny, but because my testimony
 has sort of so much in it, I wanted to see what I had covered
 and what I hadn't, you know, as getting ready for the call.
 You were standing there and I was like,
  </li><li>Babe, gosh, I guess I listened to my testimony.
 I think my testimony is brutal.
 And you said something to the effect of,
 no, babe, your testimony is glorious,
 your history is brutal.
 And I was just like, right, yeah, my testimony is glorious
 because actually the Lord's done what He said He would do.
  </li><li>He's been faithful. - He's been faithful.
  </li><li>While life was tragic. - Yes.
  </li><li>So we're discovering that feeling of feelings
 is essential for full living.
  </li><li>Yes.
 The question that we must ask ourselves is,
 how do we live fully?
  </li><li>Well, Chip actually talks about this in his book.
 He gives us three steps.
  </li><li>Yeah, there are three simple steps to say.
  </li><li>Simple steps to say.
  </li><li>Really hard steps to do.
  </li><li>Yes, so we're gonna feel our feelings.
  </li><li>That's step one.
  </li><li>Yeah, we're gonna tell the truth.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then we're gonna actually give it to God.
  </li><li>Yeah, really simple.
 Feel your feelings, tell the truth, give it to God.
 Boom, we're done.
 Thanks so much for joining us.
 We'll be back next week with Chip, okay?
 Now it would be unfair if we just left you with those things.
  </li><li>It's over and over and over and over, isn't it?
 Like, oh, yeah.
  </li><li>So let's unpack what that actually means,
 like to feel your feelings.
 Like again, it sounds so ridiculous to be talking about
 like, how do you feel your feelings?
 'Cause aren't we all gonna feel our feelings?
 My experiences, no, I mean, sure, I was feeling my feelings,
 I was unaware I was feeling my feelings.
 I was practicing the fine art of disconnection and denial.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, my MO was shove it down.
  </li><li>Yeah, and by the way, your feelings don't go anywhere.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>They just, it's like beach balls underwater.
 They're still there.
  </li><li>They're waiting.
  </li><li>They're just gonna eventually blow up for sure.
 Well, it's like the bit you just read from Chip's book,
 like feeling your feelings is taking responsibility
 for what's in your heart.
 It's actually slowing down enough to honor your heart,
 to give it attention to what you're actually feeling.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>We're gonna give you some practical steps
 on how you do that later.
 But for now, it's simply something as simple as like,
 admit what's in there.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 me the journey initially was I judged what was in there. Like I had toxic shame about
 having feelings. So I didn't want to admit what was in there, but like through the practice
 of slowing down like what am I feeling and I should be able to unpack that and being
 present with myself, I would begin to feel my feelings. And for me as a high verbal processor,
 I would need to talk about what I was feeling before I discovered what I was feeling. Like
 I'm aware there's stuff going on, but I can't articulate it until I slow down enough to
 like, okay, I'm feeling this and I would discover the more and more I talked.
 And in some cases, the more and more I was asked helpful questions, the more and more
 I could actually unpack it.
 But I went from I'm aware that there's stuff going on in my body to I can now articulate.
 I'm using my brain to convey what my heart is experiencing.
 So you have that option.
 You have the feel your feelings, or you have the antithesis of feeling your feelings, which
 which is run away from the most fast as you possibly can.
 So try and shove them down or medicate them.
 So Netflix or a chocolate or porn
 or whatever the thing is that you use
 to hide from the big feelings that you have.
  </li><li>Yeah, to hide from your feelings
 or not be present with yourself.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>We were just talking about being on vacation.
 Probably the first half of my vacation was not ruined
 but was misspent because I was spending so much energy
 not wanting to feel feelings that I had, right?
 I'm on vacation.
 I don't want my vacation to be ruined
 by feeling these negative emotions.
 And so all of this energy goes into not being present
 so that I can enjoy vacation, whatever that is.
 So I stop living, I stop living to prevent myself
 from feeling, which is so ironic.
 And so I'm like, just coming from you,
 I'm just coming from the kids and just coming from myself.
 I'm, you know, thankfully we bought marshmallows,
 I'm feeding myself marshmallows, I'm playing Nintendo.
  </li><li>All of this energy spent on not feeling
 'cause I don't want to ruin my vacation.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>When actually just sitting down and going,
 okay, what am I feeling?
 All right, I'm feeling this, that, the next thing,
 you know, what am I gonna do about that?
 I don't have to do anything 'cause I'm on vacation.
 It would have been a much, much better approach.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I think part of the reason for me at least
 that I don't wanna feel my feelings
 is that I discover I'm not enough
 to heal what's causing my feelings.
  </li><li>I don't understand.
  </li><li>Part of the reason I don't wanna be present
 I don't want to be present with my feelings,
 as it leads me to an understanding that I am vulnerable
 and in need of God and other people.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So if I sit with my feelings and I realize,
 okay, I am sad, angry, lonely, fearful,
 I realize there's advanced situations people
 that are contributing to those feelings.
 And in order for me to bring resolution to those feelings,
 like my feelings are telling me what I need
 and what I need is outside of what I have.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And it's in the hands of people you can't control.
  </li><li>And the hands of people in the hands of God.
 And so it's just like, no, it would just be easier to just sit here and just kind of binge watch Netflix.
 At least Netflix doesn't require anything of me.
 At least I don't have to be vulnerable with Netflix.
 Netflix is not going to judge me.
 Occasionally it's like, are you seriously still watching or should we pause?
 Right.
 But the part of my
 part of my reluctance to feel is it leads me to understanding I need others and I need God.
 Yeah.
 And yet that vulnerability and that powerlessness,
 it actually leads us to an awareness of what we need,
 which is actually others and to God.
  </li><li>Which leads us to step number two.
 So step number one is feeling your feelings.
 Step number two is tell the truth.
  </li><li>Tell the truth.
  </li><li>Telling the truth about what our heart is feeling
 actually means that we express the unvarnished version
 of all that's going on in our hearts.
  </li><li>Which is hugely scary because we're being vulnerable.
 Yes. We're telling another person, this is what it's like to be me.
 Yes. With all of my stuff and all of my junk.
 And by the way, my story is different from your story.
 So, you know, we might have experienced the same events, but this is how I felt about those events.
 And I'm frightened that you've got your own events and, you know, then we're going to get into
 fight about who's event, you know, ah, so vulnerable. And most of us have been misunderstood by others
 and not been alive to be afraid to share. It's important that we understand when we talk about
 telling the truth is it's, you know, me sharing my truth with you is not permission for me to
 mow you down as I flesh out about how you've hurt me. Like the point of telling the truth to others
 is not vengeance. The point of telling the truth about others is intimacy. It's like we,
 I'm being vulnerable by telling you what it's like to be me in this moment and I'm asking you to be
 present with me. Yeah. I must have very sacred, you know, precious thing to be on the receiving
 and to care deeply for other people's feelings.
 Yes.
 And requires tremendous skill.
 So I will say this, if you, you know, when we talk about, you know,
 feeling feelings, tell the truth, those who you tell truth to,
 I would encourage you, make sure there are people who've done their own work
 around their own feelings.
 Yes.
 Because otherwise, otherwise, if it was like me years ago, I didn't even care
 for my own feelings.
 So why would I, you know, why would you expect me to care for yours?
 Yeah.
 So like be kind to yourself as you're beginning to share your feelings.
 One of the people that you can absolutely share your feelings with and tell the truth about is to God.
 We're going to get to God in a second.
 Start there, but look for your leaders, your family members, your friends, your counselors,
 people who've actually done the work around their own feelings so that they're a safe place to hold your feelings.
 Babe, I was thinking about that time a couple of years ago at Christmas.
 Christmas. Do you remember the time I'm talking about? And we had, we had just
 moved into this house. Yes. We realized we had no money for Christmas. And so we
 used like vouchers and stuff to get presents for the kids. Yep. And so we're
 having this discussion and basically you said, so you and I are not getting
 anything for Christmas. And you know, we're getting these things for the kids. And I
 I was like, you know, the logical, I'm an adult in the house person should be able to go.
 Yes, that's fine.
 Yeah, that makes totally sense.
 We've got a brand new house.
 It makes sense, you know, and you even gave me the logic to hold on to.
 We have a brand new house.
 The house is your present for Christmas and whatever.
 And I was like, right, right.
 But then I tried to circle back with you.
 And I was like, babe, I just still feel really sad because I'm a gifts person.
 And then at the time you hadn't met Chip and friends and you tried to logic me out of it.
 Well, that's just not reasonable.
 Well, I did more than that.
 I tried to shame you for even having that feeling because I felt my own shame about not being able
 to provide enough money for you to be able to.
 You know, I'm feeling fear that I can't get you a gift.
 I'm feeling shame that I can't get you a gift.
 I'm feeling guilt.
 I don't know I'm feeling those things because I've not done any of this work.
 Yeah.
 And so along comes you who blast you are just trying to say, I get all of that and I get the reality and I actually even agree with you.
 I feel sad about that. I have no room for your sadness. So I remember just I remember it being Christmas day and me shaming you.
 Like, and basically it was like, please get your feelings away from me. So I don't have to have my own feelings about this event.
 Yeah. And it was horrible. Yeah. It wasn't awesome. Oh, it was a low light. It was miserable.
 But what was interesting was I never circled back on that.
 But then like a year and a half later, maybe, uh, you came home from group.
 And I don't know what you had discussed at group, but you came home from group and
 just said, babe, can we talk for a minute?
 And then we sat and you just apologized for not letting me feel how I felt.
 And I was like, I mean, I hadn't thought of it since then.
 I mean that I remember, you know, but it was a really great validation of that I was allowed
 to feel because my thing would always be to shut down how I was feeling anyway.
 Right.
 So to hear you are brave enough to share a feeling with somebody you love who just shut
 up please don't have feelings.
 Right.
 I mean, I mean, the time you had no grid work for that.
 And that's why I was thinking about it when you were just saying about, "Hey, you know,
 you probably want to be careful who you practice sharing your feelings with because if they
 don't have a grid work, it might be a tricky thing."
 Oh, it might add trauma to you already.
 It might.
 That's a great story.
 Yeah, I'm so glad you shared that one.
 Oh, you're right.
 Yeah.
 That's great.
 Yeah.
 I feel sad and shame.
 That's so true.
 Yeah.
 I mean, I just think it's so good of God
 to bring restoration as well.
 Like, you know, I didn't think I needed it,
 but I realized like I just lost it
 when you circled back with me about that.
 And I was like, oh, I did feel a ton that day
 that I just happily shoved down with wherever
 I shoved the rest of it.
  </li><li>This is jumping ahead a little bit,
 but I was thinking, you know,
 I've been asked what's the benefit
 of doing all this feeling stuff.
 It is much easier for me, I don't know how to say this clumsily.
 It's much easier for me to be present with you when you have feelings that are different
 from mine and for me to not try and persuade you why what you're feeling is wrong.
 Like if it feels, at least to me, I'm hoping that you confirm this, that since doing this
 feelings work, I'm okay if you have a feeling that's different from my feeling.
 I don't like to rush in and fix it, talk you out with it.
 totally fine for you to have a feeling that's different from me, even if it's a feeling about me.
 I can't even quantify the amount of freedom and healing and blessing that's just brought to our
 marriage. And then same with the kids. It used to be that if the kids had a feeling about something,
 about vacation, or a day out, or a gift, it was all about me and my performance as a father.
 So I remember, I remember one day just almost bursting in the tears. I planned a day for the
 the kids and I'm backing up. We haven't even gone on the day and already the kids are whining
 about what we're about to do. And I remember slamming on the brakes as I'm backing out
 the driveway and I'm remembering choking back tears and I remember just wanting to sabotage
 the whole thing because I'm feeling anger, I'm feeling sad, I'm feeling shame. But what
 I'm feeling anger about is I failed as a dad. I feel deeply sad that I can't do anything
 good for my kids. I mean, just this avalanche of shame, and then wanted to just move away
 from that as quickly as possible and shame them for being ungrateful so-and-so's. And
 this is all pre this work and just thinking, okay, you're the grownup in the car. Like,
 they're like five and seven and, you know, like two, like it's gonna be okay, you know,
 like, hey, just, you know, suck it up. Whereas now I think it's much easier for me to be with
 the kids, like even like we've had two of them have birthdays during quarantine and
 the sadness that they have felt. I've been here with you with them and and not be like,
 well, you I'm grateful so and so. You don't realize all the effort that Mummy and I have
 got. It's just like, oh, babe, I totally got it. That must be really hard. It must be really
 sad. That is not just a benefit for the kids. It's not just a benefit for you. It's a benefit
 for me that actually I can be present with the people I love because their feelings are
 are not about me.
 They don't have to manage them to make their feelings go away.
 So I don't have feelings of my own.
 I don't even know what that's worth, $10 million?
  </li><li>Yeah, at least.
  </li><li>No, but seriously, what a rich gift.
 So what are we talking about?
 We're talking about telling the truth.
  </li><li>Telling the truth, yeah.
  </li><li>So what does telling the truth look like?
  </li><li>Well, it could be having a brave conversation
 with a family member or your spouse or whatever.
  </li><li>Like making your thinking visible,
 your feelings visible, yep.
  </li><li>Yeah, okay.
 It could be a list of I statements.
 I feel this when you, you know,
 it might be writing a letter that maybe you're never
 gonna send, but at least you're writing out the I feel
 of things.
 Telling the truth might be group therapy.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Right?
 It might be signing up to start.
  </li><li>Or even individual therapy.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>This is what it's like to be me.
 Yeah, there's a wide, it could be prayer.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 pouring out your lament to God and journaling.
  </li><li>The book of Psalms is David telling the truth
 about how he's feeling.
  </li><li>Wow, is it?
  </li><li>And all is unvarnished glory.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I think telling the truth is having been present
 with yourself and feeling your feelings,
 you now let your insights out to someone else.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>To others and to God.
 Here's something to consider.
 You know, you talked about having a brave conversation
 with a family member or a friend.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I don't know of too many things that are scarier
 than bringing your feelings, which might be illogical,
 might be unreasonable to somebody else,
 especially if those feelings are about them.
 Like I feel this when you said this,
 like that's hugely vulnerable.
 But here's the thing,
 your feelings are never going to go away.
 And your options are either tell this person the truth
 about your experience with them or lie to them.
 I mean, that's it.
 Like your avoidance is still lying.
 And lying's bad no matter how well intentioned
 your lies are, well, I didn't wanna hurt you.
 Listen, your feelings aren't going to go away.
 At some point, the threshold is going to be crossed
 when your feelings are going to come out of you sideways.
 It's like that couple who have been building animosity
 for years and never taught about anything.
 And then the husband's just like, hey,
 could you pass the catch up?
 And the wife picks up the catch up bottle and throws it.
 And it's like, get your own dead catch up.
 Her explosion isn't about the catch up.
 Her explosion is about all of these built up feelings
 that she's never chosen to tell the truth about.
 So be kind to yourself in your relationships and tell the truth.
 Tell the truth.
 Which brings us to give it to God.
 Yes.
 What does that mean?
 Well, having felt your feelings and told the truth, now you're led to actually, I need
 to give this to God because I actually can't do anything about this.
 Like I need God to intervene.
 Right.
 Because this, the things that are causing me to have feelings are outside of my control.
 Like most things in life.
 All I can do is accept them and bring them to God.
 Yes.
 It's amazing, isn't that revelation that God wants to be with us in our brokenness?
 Yeah.
 That while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
 Yes.
 His desire to be with us was way before we ever got anything right.
 Yeah.
 And actually, his power is made perfect in our weakness.
 It's amazing how often I fight to not feel weak when actually that's my inherent state.
 Yeah.
 I am weak.
 actually draws close to the brokenhearted.
  </li><li>And he binds those who are crushed in spirit,
 which comes back to the kilnfers, like,
 "Wow, Alan, you have no need for Jesus,
 'cause you just don't want to feel any of your feelings.
 That's amazing."
 Thanks, Chester and Betsy.
 Yeah, when we invite the Father in our brokenness
 and into our pain, we're surprised
 at his tender response to our weakness.
 He actually loves to dwell among us.
 He loves to be among the broken.
 And then our intimacy level skyrockets,
 because God wants to be with us in our authentic state.
 And so living a full life is all about refusing to hide
 and be vulnerable and be transparent,
 which is scary, but has these tremendous rewards
 because then your relationships go to a new level
 and your relationship with a father is built on intimacy
 'cause it's founded in truth.
  </li><li>Yeah, and you get to actually be you?
  </li><li>I think it's beautiful that the gladness
 of God to be with us in our weakness.
 like that verse you quoted earlier, Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
 you know, you who stoned the prophets,
 like how I've longed to gather you, like,
 oh, I can see you're in pain, I can see you're in torment.
 Even though you're killing my messengers,
 I just wanna be with you, I wanna comfort you,
 I wanna be in your presence.
 The Lord's delight to be with us in our brokenness
 is beautiful.
 And what we discover is that when we're with the Lord,
 His joy to be with us drowns out the toxic shame
 that says we don't deserve to be with Him.
 He loves to be with us, which is contrary to what our toxic shame tells us that...
 You have to perform.
 Right.
 Or, you know, he ought not to want to be with us.
 Yes.
 Giving it to God is basically bringing God into the equation, asking for help, and recognizing
 that I am needy and incapable of my own.
 All right.
 So there might be people that are listening to us saying, "All right, Alan and AJ, I've
 done those three things, but nothing has changed."
 Well, if your goal to feeling your feelings and doing the work, you're feeling your feelings
 tell truth, give it to God. If your goal in all of that is to make your feelings go away, then you
 are right. Nothing has changed because you're always going to have feelings. If your goal to doing
 that process of feeling your feelings was to make the thing that was causing you to have feelings,
 to resolve and go away, then you're right. Absolutely nothing has changed. But if your goal was to
 enter into full living, then congratulations, a lot has changed. Right. Like your circumstances may be
 exactly the same. But the way that you live them, you've taken a step away from a denial and a step
 toward open-hearted living. Your honesty level is through the roof. The Father is now connecting
 to you in your weakness and your intimacy. You, plus God, is the majority. You have embraced your
 limitations and discovered that in your weakness, God's power is perfect. You might not have discovered
 it, but you're on the process to discovering it. And you've embraced communion with God as a better
 way of living than stoicism and isolation. Yeah. Like a lot has changed just through doing
 those three processes. Yeah. And actually, whoever you're walking through the process
 with, like whoever the people are that you're telling the truth with, you are building real
 connection, real bridges, real community, where if you've spent your life actually shoving things
 down, you didn't have that even if you thought you did. This is the part I was alluding to earlier
 when I said, Hey, we're going to talk about this towards the end is, you know, people ask me,
 like, you know, it was all a feeling stuff worth it. Like, and they're disappointed when I say,
 yeah, it's worth it. Like, I am sadder than I've ever been in my life. I'm lonelier than I've ever
 been. I'm angrier than I've ever been. And people look at me like with this confused look like,
 why would you even want that? But they misunderstand what I mean. And what I mean by that is I'm more
 alive than I've ever been in my life. Right, if being alive is feeling your feelings, I'm more
 alive than I've ever, I've ever felt all those parts of my heart, the sad parts, the lonely parts,
 the shameful parts, the guilty parts, all those things. I now have more access to them, which means
 I have more of me, which in turn means I have more of me to share with those I love. Which means I
 have more of you. Right. So it's just this win-win, it's just scary because I don't think I would
 want to do the work based on my description of the glory of doing the work. No, probably not.
 No, but the beauty of God is I found my limitations in my own approach of stoicism
 and actually discovering like, oh yeah, I need something I don't have, which means I'm going to
 do something I've never done before to get results I really really want but can't articulate what
 they might be. But this is what they are. It's like full living, full life, and it's glorious.
 And full access to your own heart. Yeah. Yeah. One of the things that I worried about,
 one of the things I genuinely have fear about doing like a 10 part 11 part series on feelings is
 somehow that we're making it sound like we have arrived. Like yeah, we've got feelings down. That
 could not be further from the truth. Like I am acutely aware of how stunted I am in my
 understanding and my experience of feelings and at the same time how far I've come.
 Yes. So we're not experts by any means. We're people who have tasted and seen that God is good
 in the midst of our feelings and just wanting to share the joy of the revelation that we found.
 Yeah. And we're in a process and still learning. I'm still learning to unlearn how I've previously
 dealt with feelings. And I literally have to think through the
 feel your feelings, tell the truth, bring it like I have to,
 it still feels very methodical. Right. Because I'm
 actually mirror signal maneuver. Right. I'm unlearning a pattern
 that was familiar for 45 years. And I'm learning, well, longer
 than that, but let's not talk about that. And then learning a
 new pattern, which feels very like counterintuitive, because I
 was so practiced in the way that I dealt with emotion before.
 So I love that we're doing this work. I love the change that I've
 seen, but it's still very for me. I still have to think through
 the process of whatever. And even today we were just chatting,
 lying in bed, and I was crying about something. And I can't
 even remember what you asked me, but I was literally like,
 it's gonna make me think feelings, you know?
  </li><li>I'm gonna make you feel feelings.
  </li><li>No, but I mean like be processed by, you know,
 with feeling taught and really I didn't want to.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know, because again, my previous ways of processing life
 are way more familiar and easier.
 It's just that they haven't gotten me the results
 that I wanted.
 So, yeah.
  </li><li>I was just on Instagram earlier
 And I saw Sage Hill post this great thing.
 I'll put it up here.
 I hope that's okay, Sage Hill.
 But it says that start where you are,
 use what you have, do what you can.
  </li><li>So practically what can our listeners do?
  </li><li>Like start where you are,
 get out a piece of paper
 and just write out what you're feeling.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like just, that's a very first step
 of feeling your feeling in telling the truth.
 Your telling the truth to yourself
 about what you're feeling.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>The beautiful thing about writing
 is it slows down the process.
 like I'm often unaware that I'm having feelings.
 Like often in meetings, ages like, hey, honey,
 like it looks like you're feeling something.
 And I'm like, am I?
 Yes, I am.
 And so writing things down slows me down,
 gets me in touch with what I'm feeling.
 Like I said earlier, I'm a high verbal processor.
 If I've got nobody to talk to, then me and you Jesus
 and I'm writing it out, that would be like one
 of the encouragements I would have is just write it out.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Next practical thing, like start where you are,
 use what you have.
 Use what you have. I guess look at the community around you.
 Look for safe people that you could actually talk and process your feelings
 with that would have a, a level of understanding about what you're trying to do.
 Yeah. Um, I would say one of the kindest things you could do for yourself is find
 a counselor. Yes.
 They are professionals who want to be with you who are not going to try and
 adjust your feelings to make them more appropriate.
 And I also understand that could be quite expensive, but I'm also aware that
 there are probably counselors in the area where you live
 who will work on a sliding scale,
 who will work with your budget.
 But that can be one of the kindest things.
 Remember what Ajay and I said earlier about finding somebody
 who is trustworthy to speak to.
 The last thing you wanna do is do all that work
 to hand over your feelings to somebody
 who's then just gonna crash them.
 (laughing)
 And then start talking to the Lord.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You know, if you've already written it out,
 written out your feelings, ask the Lord, Lord,
 What do you have to say about my feelings?
 Listen for that still small voice
 and then write down what you feel
 like the Holy Spirit is speaking to you about,
 you know, your feelings.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then the last practical thing,
 I have a bit of, I've got lots of gladness to talk about it,
 but I've got a lot of sadness to talk about it
 'cause I realize all my enthusiasm might be for naught
 because what I'm so heavily encouraging you to do
 might actually be available where you live.
 And that's like joining a process group,
 like joining group therapy.
 It sounds terrifying.
 I'm in group therapy.
 It's not terrifying, it's beautiful.
 I got introduced to it because of Sage Hill.
 It's an amazing organization here in Nashville
 which runs groups all over the city.
 I would imagine that I would hope
 that that is available in cities other than Nashville.
 You might just have to call a counseling center and ask,
 do you have men or women's groups
 where you can do process groups.
 It's certainly not unique to Sage Hill.
 It is a therapeutic practice, but for me,
 that has been just this amazing Petri dish is the wrong thing. Sandbox to play it.
  </li><li>Yeah, Petri dish is like a horrible...
  </li><li>Yeah. It's a great sandbox to play in and practice feeling your feelings in front of other people
 and also practice being with other people who are feeling their feelings. Like, how do you respond
 when people you don't even know have strong feelings about stuff, maybe even you?
 And such a glorious thing. It's honestly one of the highlights of my week every week to be
 in a group process. And I appreciate that that might not be available in your city,
 which would be another thing that you're powerless over that you can take to God
 and have feelings over. Yeah. And then lastly, like, you know, there's oodles of books and podcasts
 to listen to. I would, I'm angry for you to do less up here work and more in here work. And I'm
 angry for that for ourselves too. Yeah, me too. So we're done. So your three step process,
 your homework is to feel your feelings, to tell the truth, and to give it to God, and
 then do it again.
 Over and over and over.
 And again, yeah.
 Yeah.
 Next week we're going to have Dr. Chip Dodd with us, which we're very excited about.
 I'm so excited.
 He's going to be on a screen somewhere like here.
 And we would love to have questions to ask him.
 You've already sent in some great questions.
 If you'd like us to ask him a question that has been that you've been thinking about as
 we've been talking, go to allenagie.com/ask.
 can fill in your question and we'll be sure to ask them about it.
 So good. I'll have a wonderful week and we will see you again next week.
 Yeah, go. Bye.
