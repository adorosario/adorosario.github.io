<p> I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes sir.<br/>
 It's December.<br/>
 It is December.<br/>
 Cue Christmas music.<br/>
<strong>[SINGING]</strong><br/>
 That's show too.<br/>
 Walking in a winter wonderland.<br/>
 Oh, I see where you're going with that.
 Thank you.<br/>
 So tell me what you're most excited about for Christmas.
 I'm excited.<br/>
 Well, we might get snow in a couple days.
 That's the rumor.<br/>
 Apparently Tennessee is getting snow on Thursday.
 I don't know how much snow, but that makes me happy.
 You think that will actually happen?<br/>
 Well, it's hard to say, but you know that the cancel schools anyway.
 They probably already scantled school in anticipation.
 Right.<br/>
 But we have a hill in our yard now.<br/>
 So we do get snow.<br/>
 The kids are going to be out there, but it's the shortest hill ever.
 It doesn't matter.<br/>
 They'll love it.<br/>
 Line with trees halfway down.<br/>
 Oh, sort of.<br/>
 It'll be challenging.<br/>
 It'll be a slong course.<br/>
 That'll be fine.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 Tell me about this week.<br/>
 What was a good week?<br/>
 We had RT candles spoke on the school on second year
 and did a great job, of course.<br/>
 And we took him out for Southern cooking.
 So he was a happy man.<br/>
 That man loves the Southern cooking.<br/>
 He does indeed.<br/>
 It's really funny because RT and his wife Louise,
 although they were, although they're Americans by birth,
 they lived in the UK longer than I did.
 And so they're way more British in their sense of humor
 and in their approach and in their personalities
 than they are American.<br/>
 So when they come to Gray Center,<br/>
 we just pick up where we last left off.
 And I'm sure, I'm sure like, for example,
 we were having lunch with them this week.
 And I'm sure the surrounding tables listening
 to our conversations would have been appalled
 with the abuse that was being thrown around the table
 because--
</p><ul>
  <li>Well, quite sarcastic.
  </li><li>As everybody in Britain,
 But most people in Britain don't realize how sarcastic they are because it's just normal.
 It's like oxygen.
 To Americans, some of our well-meaning and well-placed humor is actually quite cutting
 and sarcastic.
 Yeah.
 And then Jeff and Becky were on year one and they just sort of lit the place up.
 Yeah.
 Every time I walked past the main auditorium where Jeff and Becky were ministering, there
 were just bodies everywhere and people yelling.
 So it was quite an adventurous week.
 So that was the beginning of the week.
 And at the end of the week, we had Brian Simmons come in, Brian and his wife, Candice, have
 been at grace number four.
 Brian is the author and the translator of the passion version of the Bible.
 He's just about finished a New Testament.
 He said he was working on Revelation.
 Yep.
 It's taken a years, I think, to translate the New Testament.
 I have no idea.
 And there's translations from the Aramaic into English.
 And we've read a bunch of his translations.
 I mean, we have a bunch of his verses.
 Bunch of his verses.
 What is true of the books that he's been translating and so it's great to have him with us this weekend as well and then today we have this longer pleaters over for lunch and I made.
 Christmas cookies when you say you made them well okay I got kind of pre-made ones and put them on a cookie sheet also actually even bake them yeah I think that they just came out of a 10 no.
 No I bake them okay so you show them in the oven yeah I show them in the oven you would want credit for that if you've done that you would have acted like you made them from scratch.
 [laughter]
 True, very true.
 But then I made apple cider.
 When you say you made apple cider?
 I mean, I bought apple cider and I got mauling spices and I put it all together and I boiled
 it.
 [laughter]
 I didn't actually like juice the apples, but other than that, it was me.
 It was really nice.
 I had to say that when I opened the door, I came home from church.
 You were home before me.
 When I opened the front door and there was Christmas music on the stereo and there was
 a fire blazing and there was the smell of the, you know, all thethe 
 cider and the ginger snap cookies of like, come on Christmas.
 Yes, I was going for the Christmas atmosphere.
 Obviously, this is dangerous because we only talk about the highlights of our weeks.
 You can think that by the center of our podcast, our world is wonderful.
 But yesterday was an example where our world wasn't that wonderful, wasn't it?
 Yes.
 Well, while we were out and I'm talking about what we were doing,
 I was contemplating who's the best marriage counselor to help us out of this situation.
 I am, of course, referring to the task.
 Well, how did you tell the story, babe?
 Well, we're trying to hang some Christmas lights on a tree.
 We are.
 Well, you don't really let me help.
 Every, every time I try and help you go, oh, no, that's not how you know.
 And then you just, so I just stand there.
 But we bought.
 We, we, we, like all of this.
 We hang on.
 We, I was there.
 We bought Christmas lights.
 Right. But in this flipping idea was it to have Christmas lights outside. Right. Right.
 Right. This is all your idea. Right.
 So I want a Christmas lights because we've never had Christmas lights outside
 our house. And I'm fast realizing why we've never had Christmas tree lights.
 Well, I said our house.
 I'm not sure that our experience is exactly the normal experience.
 However, we went and got six drinks of Christmas lights thinking we would put
 three per tree. Right. Because that was, what was that about 45 feet of lights each?
 Yeah. A little bit more than that.
 Oh, that'll be fine.
 There was 17 feet per string.
 So 17 times three is.
 And try the one.
 What is it?
 Oh, 51.
 Okay.
 51 feet of lights per tree.
 And so we started with one tree.
 Yeah.
 And then we realized three strings wasn't going to be enough.
 We're going to need six strings per tree.
 So we just doubled the budget.
 Right.
 So now we need to go back and get more Christmas lights for doing the second tree.
 However, they've sold out of the lights that we used and have already put up on our tree.
 So I got different lights hoping that you wouldn't be able to tell, but you totally could tell.
 So I took those lights back.
 Then I thought I found ones that would work.
 And so I got those lights, brought them back, but they were a different style of light.
 And even though they were the same sort of coloring, they were going to produce a different results.
 Then I took those ones back.
 So basically I went to at home store five times to return lights and finally end up with the
 lights that we have, which we've only put up two strings because by the time we got to all of that
 and then putting up two strings. I'd lost the will to live. Yes. And I was like, I'm going inside,
 I'm making food before I kill you. The trouble was when we teach on how to do confrontation,
 We tell people never ever do a confrontation when you're in the state of halt.
 Halt stands for hungry, angry, lonely, tired.
 I'm now going to add never do Christmas decorating when you're in a state of halt either.
 Right.
 Because it was...
 Or maybe just let your spouse do the decorating.
 But you can't reach.
 Right. I met you.
 I was just like you do.
 Oh, I see.
 Well, that's pretty much what you did.
 But you would stand like the ghost of Christmas Pass purely over my shoulder.
 Because every time I would suggest something, you go, "No."
 No, no, no, no, no.
 And I'm like, OK, never mind.
 I'll just stand here and you can just mock me.
 But that's what I did ask you to do.
 You didn't do.
 Well, because you're like, hey, reach for that branch.
 I'm like, sure, buddy, because I'm seven feet tall.
 I can totally grab that branch.
 Hang on a second.
 Just let me levitate up there and get it for you.
 But the funny thing was we must have had, what, four
 or five different false starts.
 OK, we'll try this.
 Yeah, we tried wrapping the branches.
 And then after we threw you got frustrated with that.
 and just reap the mall of the tree.
 I'm like, the tree may not live through this.
 It was horrible.
 And then started raining.
 Yeah.
 And it was icy cold.
 Yeah.
 And our children kept wanting to like, Mom, Dad, what are you?
 Can we have a question?
 Like, what are you doing?
 So Merry Christmas.
 Thanks.
 We have like two, two strings of lights that look incredibly
 gimpy just hanging from one tree.
 Yes.
 And eight that still need to go up.
 So if there's anybody listening that has a Christmas
 light gift. I would like to come and save our marriage. Please volunteer. Bye.
 I might have uprooted the trees by then.
 Seriously. Well, strangely enough, our topic for this week is don't give up.
 Oh, no, just let your spirit listen to the topic then so you can get those lights done tomorrow.
 Don't give up and outsource it to somebody else. Yeah. Should we talk about our topic this week?
 Yeah, go ahead. It came really this week. Every second week we have a passage meeting at Grace
 and all the passes get together and one of us takes turns in encouraging the rest of us.
 And so we all share something. It was my turn this week to share something.
 And I shared on the topic of not giving up. And I thought, I think we should share it with our
 listeners too. I'm not sure it's because it's the whole typical end of the year thing, you know,
 where you've used up all your energy for 2016 and you're like, "Ah, it's December. We'll just sleep
 through the rest of the next four weeks and wake up in 2017."
 You mean the reason you want to give up is because it's the end?
 Yeah, I mean, don't you feel like you've got less energy to face each day such as me?
 Yes, well, I think I feel tired, but I'm starting to get excited about Christmas because the kids are so I'm starting to start to ride that wave.
 Oh, right. I see. I doesn't have like it's dark at like 4 p.m. either.
 Does not help at all.
 No, so.
 And today it was cold and rainy all day.
 Yeah, so I was like, well, you guys, everybody in Scotland's like,
 I'm stuck it up.
 You're like, you're like, welcome to our lives 12 months of the year.
 That's not true. They get sunny danger like that.
 Anyway, there's a huge temptation. I realized to just be like,
 "Mah, you know, 2016, don't let the door hit you on the back side."
 Right.
 And that's not true because 2016 has been awesome, but it just seems to be this kind of slow down climate.
 Anyway, I was thinking about what I would want to hear on Wednesday,
 and I was thinking, "I would want to be super encouraged."
 And scripture is just filled with encouragement.
 I mean, sure, there's some places where it's not that encouraging.
 Lamentations, some of the sounds i'm looking at you guys words not encouraging but the general premise that god is never gonna leave us or forsake us is hugely encouraging that to know of itself absolutely by the way did you watch the preview for the shack movie i did i bought also like the bit.
 the bit where the woman says i never left you yeah it's it's it's the book we haven't read it have you
 i don't want to ruin it for anybody okay it's an interesting premise and i love it i love the message
 uh of it um yeah i bald so yeah anyway the whole premise of scripture is is one of
 incredible encouragement so i've got a couple of verses for you yes i'm going to read the bible
 to be a really look at this look 18 verse one.
 One day alone.
 I'm not sure.
 The B.I.
 B.I.

 B.I.
 B.I.
 B.I.
 B.I.
 I feel like I'm going to give up and I need some help here.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Jesus goes on and tells the story, you know, really well.
 It's the righteous woman who has a wicked judge, she keeps coming to him and requesting
 and requesting and requesting that he'd oversee her case.
 And basically this woman wears the man down.
 And then the Lord said, "Learn a lesson from this unjust judge," even though he was totally
 wicked and he didn't care about other people, eventually a just decision was made in the
 end.
 So don't you think that God's surely going to give justice to?
 And then Jesus ends with this.
 He says, but when the Son of Man returns, how many will he find on earth who have faith?
 Yeah, that verse is a little bit weird because in first pass, it looks like Jesus is saying, hey, my father's just like this unjust judge.
 And of course, that's not what he's doing until he's using contrast to illustrate the vast differences between our loving heavenly father and this, this wicked and unjust judge.
 And his point is if even this wicked and unjust judge
 would eventually give a righteous verdict.
 Yeah.
 How much more your father in heaven
 who loves justice and loves you?
 Right.
 So that's the first thing.
 The second thing I found interesting
 is faith is only required in the absence of what you need.
 Right.
 Like you don't need faith at any other point.
 Like as soon as your need is met, faith turns to rejoicing.
 Right.
 And so it's interesting this Jesus is saying,
 Hey, in the absence of what you need,
 are you going to give up having faith?
 Is the Son of Man going to find that when he returns?
 So I want to encourage everybody who feels like
 they're just fatigued, feels like they're ready to give up,
 feels like things are overwhelming.
 My encouragement to you come straight from Jesus,
 don't give up, but just pray.
 Just say, Lord, I just need strength.
 And sometimes that's, I remember you sharing your testimony
 where you went to your aunt and you just wanted
 kill yourself, you wanted to die, things were so grim. And you said, I don't know how to do this.
 And she said, she said, you, you say to God, all right, God, you and me the next five minutes,
 and in five minutes, you say it again, and you let him get you through it.
 And that sounds trite, but I'm sure there was days when you absolutely did that.
 That was most of what I did for weeks until I finally got to where I was
 saying it every 10 minutes, baby steps. But you're here today because of that.
 Paul, the apostle Paul, is just going to be the master and courageor.
 You know, all the way through scripture.
 I mean, you've heard Brian Simmons teach this weekend about Paul writing
 from prison in Philippians.
 Right.
 Four of his epistles are written from prison and telling people to be joyful.
 Right.
 And he's totally, he's like talking about how thankful he is and everything from prison.
 He's going to get beheaded shortly, but he's thankful.
 So in, in second Corinthians four, twice Paul encourages those who
 was writing to not give up. And they're facing terrible persecution. He's like, Hey, guys, just
 don't give up. So I'm going to read this. I apologize if this is a little long, but this is second
 Corinthians six verse four to 10. I'm reading from the new living translation. Paul writes this,
 and everything we do, we show that we are true ministers of God. By the way, he's not writing
 to ministers of God here. He's writing to you. He's writing to everybody's right into just a
 the church made up of a bunch of people.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>This is as we patiently endured troubles and hardships
 and calamities of every kind.
 We've been beaten, been put in prison,
 faced angry mobs, worked to exhaustion,
 endured sleepless nights and gone without food.
 We prove ourselves by our purity, our understanding,
 our patience, our kindness,
 by the Holy Spirit within us and by our sincere love.
 We faithfully preach the truth.
 God's power is working in us.
 We use the weapons of righteousness
 in the right hand for attack and in the left hand for defense.
 We serve God whether people honor us or despise us,
 whether they slander us or praise us.
 We're honest but they call us imposters.
 We're ignored even though we are well known.
 We live close to death but we're still alive.
 We've been beaten but we have not been killed.
 Our hearts ache but we always have joy.
  </li><li>That's pretty amazing isn't it?
  </li><li>It is really amazing.
  </li><li>Our hearts ache but we always have joy.
 (sighs)
  </li><li>So here's the thing, we can listen to that
 we can read it and just think, and I don't think Paul's doing that, "Look, suck up, guys.
 At least you haven't been beaten or been put in prison." But the danger is we can read those
 verses and think, "Well, they don't really apply to us." But I know people listening to this podcast,
 you are patiently enduring trouble and hardships of some kind. Maybe it's criticism from coworkers,
 maybe it's rejection from family, maybe it's just general sadness or despair.
 Well, you know, whatever it is, there's hardships as difficulties that people go through.
 But I also know that the encouragement from the Lord is to just continue to prove yourself
 by purity, continue to walk in understanding, continue to extend grace.
 And by the way, the only people you extend grace to are people who don't need it.
 Otherwise, it wouldn't be called grace.
 Yeah.
 And I think too, like to remember that joy isn't something that's only present in the
 absence of trouble. The joy is actually available to you in the midst of trouble, in the midst of
 persecution or going through things. If you can receive joy and turn to thankfulness,
 and you can be living from joy in the midst of trouble. Okay, last verse for you, Galatians 6,
 verse 7 through 10, and this is in the Analty. It says, "Don't be misled. You cannot mock the
 justice of God, you will always harvest what you plant. Those who live only to satisfy their
 own sinful nature will harvest decay and death from that sinful nature. Wow, they're not holding
 any punches in this version. But those who live to please the spirit will harvest everlasting life
 from the spirit. So let's not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time, we will reap
 a harvest of blessing if we don't give up.
 Therefore, whenever we have the opportunity, we should do good to everyone, especially
 to those in the family of faith.
 I love that you always offer an antidote to the thing that we're facing.
 Right.
 So Jesus' antidote to giving up is to pray.
 Paul's antidote to an aching heart is to find joy.
 Yeah.
 And in Galatians, his antidote to getting tired of doing what is good is to actually continue
 to do good. Just do it anyway. Yeah, I love that. Yeah. So my encouragement is everything
 you've already done this year for the kingdom is you sewing and you're going to reap something
 good from that. Sometimes we get discouraged because we don't think we're doing anything
 significant, but actually Jesus gets to decide what is significant or not. Right. Remember
 the woman who put two mites in the offering box and the Lord's like, actually she gave
 more than anybody else. She gave all she had. Everybody else just gave out their overflow.
 So all of your choices to trust God, to not give up, all your choices to honor and not
 dishonor, all of your giving, the giving that you've done that's seen and unseen, all of
 these things, just the hard work that you put in at your job, fulfilling the mandates
 of your calling, being an awesome mom, being an awesome dad, not cheating on tax reports,
 not cheating on your expense forms, any of those things, everything that you do that's
 righteous, you're going to reap a harvest of blessing.
 Right.
 And here's what I've learned about God's blessing is it's not some ethereal, nonsensical, you
 know, spiritual feel good.
 It's actually a tangible, physical thing.
 Yeah, it absolutely is.
 And what if 2016 was about sewing into the blessing in a Reap in 2017?
 How tragic would it be if we missed out on reaping something because we gave up?
 Good point, babe.
 Thanks.
 You just got stunned by my mustache that I'm growing.
 No, you're not growing a mustache.
 I will shave it in your sleeve.
 I love.
 I'm tired, too.
 I feel so good.
 Anyway, the whole point is don't give up growing mustaches.
 Don't give up in general.
 Keep your head up.
 Keep praying.
 Keep believing because God is really, really good.
 I love that he says God can't be mocked.
 Like you can't get away from the blessing of God's goodness.
 Yeah.
 And you're going to see the justice of God in all your extravagant ways.
 Absolutely.
 up on growing my stashes.
 And you're going to see the justice of God in all the six
 trafficking ways.
 Yes.
 Don't give up.
 Don't give up unless it's on growing my stashes.
 What's your problem with my stashes?
 Oh, they're just not right.
 You think Tom Sallet looked better without a mustache?
 I think, uh, yes.
 Everybody looks better without a mustache.
 Not true.
 Yeah.
 Women look better without my stashes.
 Yes, definitely.
 I'm going to grow a stunning mustache.
 No, I will attack you in your sleep.
 That could kind of be that.
 You've been warned.
 All right.
 You're ready for a listen question.
 Yes.
 This is from Ed.
 Ed writes, "Hi Alan and AJ.
 I really liked your money podcast a few weeks back.
 Thanks for the practical tips.
 You're so welcome.
 I would be interested to hear more of your thoughts on why you felt the whole tithe would
 be better to go to the church rather than other charities or organizations.
 I don't disagree, but would like to know how you came to this conclusion.
 By the way, as parents to three under five, we also love your family life chat with tips
 for keeping things simple and prioritizing. Would you have one tip over all others for
 bringing up kids in God's kingdom? Which one do you want to take the parenting of the
 tithing?
 I'll take parenting. You take tithing, go.
 All right. Well, actually, I'll put a link in the show. Artie Kendall spoke at Grayson.
 I forget whether he addressed this in the first or the second service, so I'll put a
 link to both. But he talked about this. He said the storehouse. So my, well, let's go
 with RT because he's smarter than me. He said every Jewish person would know what the storehouse
 was. The storehouse was where you got meat. It was where your provision came from. And so he said,
 the storehouse would be in modern day parlance, your local church. So the whole tithe goes to
 the local church. So some people are going to take the 10% and they're going to say, well, I'm going
 to give one some to the church and some to the Red Cross and some to this missions organization,
 some to that. And my encouragement is bring the whole tithe to the local church and then feed all
 those other ministries out of your giving. Because the supremacy of tithe and offerings.
 Right.
 So one of the things we like to do is make sure that we are tithing and we're doing offerings.
 So we carve out our 10%, obviously that just goes straight to Grey Centre,
 and then above that 10% is where we want to give out of that to other offerings.
 Yeah, and tithing protects your money, but you're giving determines your increase.
 So they're both important.
 Yeah.
 Artie did a better explanation for that.
 For sure.
 Yeah, I think that's as much as I can remember of what he said, which I thought was quite good.
 It's well worth listening to the teaching on it again.
 All right.
 One tip that's better than all others.
 One tip that is better than all others, I would say listen to the Holy Spirit is your one tip
 above all others. Because really, we have our own things that we follow that we've talked
 about before, like baby wise or whatever, that we're like, "Gosh, this really helped
 us. This was, it's made our lives run well and our family situation run well and all
 that kind of stuff." And we have shared other little tips, but really it's being able to
 talk to the Holy Spirit when you have no idea in the moment what to do or even when you're
 mid like, "Okay, that's it.
 Everybody, sit down the couch.
 We're going to have a talk and the Holy Spirit starts talking to you about, "Hey, you're
 a little grumpy right now," or, "Hey, actually."
 So if the Holy Spirit's involved in your parenting, you're going to be a way better parent.
 I don't think there's a better answer than listening to the Holy Spirit.
 So I'm not disagreeing with that.
 I have found that our kids respond so well when we're humble.
 So going to your kids and humbling yourself before them when you're in the wrong is astonishing.
 I see a different side of my kids when I go and say, "Hey, you know what, daddy didn't
 mean to say that."
 Or actually what daddy just did there was wrong.
 Or actually you're not actually not going into trouble for that.
 The reason Daddy shouted, "There's Daddy's tired and Daddy's grumpy.
 It's not your fault."
 Because one of the things we've learned is, in our pastoral training really, is when children
 are small to keep their worldview stable, they have to and they do, they interpret every
 adult's behavior as correct.
 So they internalize anything that's wrong as them.
 if they can, if they attribute blame or hurt to a grown adult and the pain is too severe, then,
 then their worldview doesn't survive. So most children internalize anything that's wrong towards
 themselves. I did something wrong. I'm a bad person. I'm so when we've gone to our kids and said,
 actually, we overreacted there or, hey, like this week, I had a dream. The Holy Spirit came to me
 in a dream and he did something amazing. So in this dream, I'm with my girls, I'm with Avogale
 and Tia, and I'm frustrated, I'm nagging them to put their jacket up or something like this,
 and I'm berating them in the conversation like, "Girls, no, how many times have I told you,
 this is where you put your jacket and I'm speaking to them like this." But while I'm in the dream,
 it's like the Holy Spirit flips a switch, and I now am in touch with what they're feeling as I'm
 saying those things to them. And I didn't realize that my tone, my intonation was causing such
 sadness to the girls in the dream. And when I woke up, I was just like, Oh, holy spirit,
 that what what I felt in their hearts is not the fruit I want to produce. Right. And so I sat down
 with them this week and just said, girls, I had a dream and in the dream, this is what happened.
 And I'm so sorry. That's not the fruit. That's not the feelings I want to produce in your heart,
 Would you forgive daddy for when he's doing that?
 And there's so, it builds so much trust, isn't it?
  </li><li>Well, and they're super forgiving, you know.
  </li><li>There we are.
 Take advantage of that while you can.
  </li><li>Yeah, oh yeah, for sure.
  </li><li>That's terrible, but what I mean is,
 I'm, these are the years where I can impress on my kids
 what it's like to have a father,
 I know that sounds ridiculous.
 But at some point, children's hearts harden
 and they then need intellect to help them understand
 why they need to do things.
 Right now, they're just, it feels like they're guided
 by pure spirit and emotion.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So I just love having these pliable kids
 who are so gracious and forgive us all our screw-ups.
  </li><li>Yeah, they're lovely.
 But see, I would say even that, like when you're talking
 about a dream and whatever, I would still say
 that's the Holy Spirit helping you parent, you know.
  </li><li>Undoubtedly.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think on a regular basis,
 I can say something or miss the heart
 of what one of my kids is trying to communicate
 and think that I know what it is.
 And it's usually those moments where the Holy Spirit's like,
 "Hey, hey, you missed it.
 Hey, you're not listening."
 You know, "Oh."
 And then you can ask, you can just go,
 "I'm sorry, I think I'm not understanding you.
 Can you tell me again why we were doing X or--
  </li><li>And you're so much better at that though.
 I see you--
  </li><li>I think you're great at it, babe.
  </li><li>No way.
 You're so good in the moment.
 I'm, I'm, I'm, I don't mean I'm better at it than you.
 I mean, I'm better.
 I'm not very good at in the moment listening to the Holy Spirit
 because I'm so, um,
 task oriented.
 Well, I'm, I'm so, it just in the moment of like, I'm either
 exasperated or frustrated or like, Oh my God, because most,
 most of parenting is repeating yourself.
 Yes.
 Really?
 Really.
 Here we go again.
 Did not realize that the shoe basket was right there.
 Like, how can you take your shoes off beside the basket, but not get the
 man that's four inches away.
 Right.
 And so you're really good in the moment of catching what's going on and changing your tone
 and listen to the Holy Spirit. I'm, I'm, unfortunately the Holy Spirit has to go,
 "Hey, knucklehead." You just did that thing again that we talked about. I'm like, "Oh, yeah.
 Okay, girls, MJ, come here. Daddy's a knucklehead." Yeah. It's fun, isn't it?
 It is. It is. It's nicer when you're full. Everything is better when you're full.
 Yeah, for sure. Yeah. You have so much more grace for, you know, whatever, she was not going in the
 basket or whatever when you've had some time off and you've had FaceTime and you've had, you know,
 FaceTime with the kids, FaceTime with the Lord, you know, basically when you're not hungry and
 hungry lonely or tired. That's correct. Yeah, pretty much everything's better when you're not in a
 state of hold. So don't parent or hang up Christmas lights and hold. That's not going to work, is it?
 No, you know, I was thinking the beginning of the podcast about hibernating and how that must be really nice for bears.
 You know, they can just go to sleep for a couple of months.
 Are you still on drugs?
 No.
 I must be tired.
 I'm just fantasizing about sleeping for months.
 Funny bunny.
 Maybe I am tired.
 All right, baby, let's wrap this thing up.
 Christmas is on its way.
 We have a bunch of products.
 the vast majority of which are not christmas gifts really like hey he's teaching on boundaries i thought you could do is listening here take this and then run.
 Here's teaching on sexual healing i thought you could do that so i'm gonna work too well but we do have two products that are not digital in nature and can actually be wrapped and put under a tree both of them are books one for adults one for children.
 The first book is a book called Finding Father that AJ wrote.
 And it is an incredible, and I can say that not just because it's you.
 I can say that because we've got hundreds of testimonies from all over the world.
 That's people reading it and having their lives changed.
 The idea is that it is a 12 week devotional Bible study.
 It can be done in groups, can be done on your own.
 But the whole idea behind it is it's intensely practical and it's designed to help you get led into a revelation of God's love as a loving father.
 Yeah.
 And so, as you wrote it, tell us a little bit about it, babe.
 Well, it's sort of written out of really probably a 10 year journey into getting
 to know the father, heart of God for me and getting past all the obstacles that
 were in place that I didn't realize were there, you know?
 And so I, yeah, wrote the book out of just a desire to see other people get the
 the breakthrough that I'd gotten.
 And it's written in bite-sized chunks, as well.
 It is. Yeah.
 It's not, it's not, it doesn't require 45 minutes or an hour, a day of study or anything like that.
 Each, each day's study is maybe 15 minutes or so.
 And then there's a journaling aspect and some soaking and stuff like that.
 But it's, it's not a huge time commitment daily.
 And part of the reason that I wanted it like that is I'm not actually after your head.
 I think God's after your heart.
 Right.
 So.
 But you will learn how to hear God's voice.
 Yes, you'll learn all about soaking what it means and you'll have this incredible heart revelation of God's love
 It makes a great gift for you makes great gift for friends and I highly encourage it
 They are currently twenty five dollars on our website if you live in the continental United States
 It's free shipping anywhere in the US. It's a great book
 We have tremendous reviews you can go read them on our website though go look at the reviews on Amazon
 I had somebody email me this week
 They said do you guys Amazon is selling your book for I don't know what it was ludicrous amount like a couple hundred dollars
 Yeah, 267.
 I'm sorry, I don't know who charges those, but you can get them on our website.
 Yeah, for much less.
 Yes.
 We'll put a link in the show.
 The second gift that you might want to consider giving to smaller children is a book called
 A Boy Named Ben, again written and illustrated by my incredible wife.
 And it is a children's book based on somebody we know and love who now lives in heaven.
 Tell us a bit about a boy named Ben.
 Well, we have a friend named Ben Farley, who's gone home to be with the Lord now about two years ago, I think.
 And, but we had the privilege of knowing Ben and I learned a lot about the Lord from Ben and just the way he navigated
 incredible difficulty in, you know, cancer and all that he was navigating and he still never wavered in believing in the goodness of God.
 I'm not just that, but healed the sick.
 Yeah, I mean, he would go and pray for people with headaches and whatever.
 I mean, here he is dying of cancer and, but he's seeing people get healed and he's praying for people in hospitals and stuff.
 And I mean, just an amazing, amazing man.
 Sunnis disposition of anyone.
 Unbelievable, unbelievable.
 And anyway, just after he passed on a Sunday morning, I was in worship and I started hearing a dialogue.
 And so I heard the first couple lines of the book, and I heard it about two or three times just
 over and over again in my head. And I was like, Holy Spirit, what's that? And he said, write it down.
 And so I wrote it down, and then I got another couple lines, and I wrote it down. And then,
 you know, it didn't hear anything after that. And I was like, Oh, that was strange.
 And then the next day I was driving in the car, and the same thing started happening.
 Not those same couple of lines, but from where it left off. And so I just got my recorder out of
 of my phone and just repeated what I was hearing. But the time I got to work, I had the book
 written. And so I sort of wrote it all out on paper and went, "Oh, wow, this is a children's
 book." And thought, "Oh, well, I'm going to check with the Farley family and then I'll
 find an illustrator." And so I checked with them, but at the same time I was talking to
 the Lord about that. He just said, "I want you to illustrate it." So that was a new adventure.
 And it's a really short book.
 It's a type of book you can read to your children
 or your grandchildren.
 Doesn't take long.
 And it's a little bit about,
 it's not about Ben per se.
 It's obviously based on his life,
 but it's about a little boy called Ben
 who goes and adventures with God.
 It's a great book to read your kids
 to get them interested in Jesus
 and talk about the wonders that God has for you.
 And so that's available.
 And if--
  </li><li>Yeah, sorry, I was gonna say,
 the premise of it is that the little boy learns
 that God's still speaking and that God's still healing
 and those sort of things.
 And so you get to go on that adventure with Ben.
  </li><li>And for every copy of a boy named Ben,
 dollar gets donated to the Ben Farley Scholarship,
 which allows people who would be prevented
 from doing the school because of financial difficulties.
 There's a scholarship that people can apply for
 and that will help pay their tuition
 to the school's supernatural life,
 which is just incredible.
 It's just I love that even in Ben's passing,
 He is still helping people have an encounter with Jesus.
 Yeah.
 Speaking of school supernatural life,
 our applications for the school are now open.
 We usually go on open till January,
 but we opened a bit earlier this year.
 We've already got applications in for next year's school.
 If you would like to come spend eight months with us
 starting in September of 2017,
 go to the link in the show notes to read more about the school
 and to store your application today.
 Baby, it's a Christmas countdown.
 It is.
 How many days do we have left to Christmas?
 I don't know. Hold on. Hey, sorry. How many days till Christmas?
 It's 20 days until then.
 I think she's a little confused because it's not 20 days.
 It is. It's 20 more days.
 How could that be?
 Because it's three weeks from today.
 But today's the fourth.
 Yeah. But it's like you can't be to the next day to the next like.
 Yeah, but this is a Sunday.
 It's a Sunday. Yeah.
 So in three weeks time, it'll be Christmas day.
 Yes.
 I think series lying to me.
 Okay, well we can explore math and the difficulties there of later on, maybe not in the air.
 It's going to be okay, baby.
 I'll explain it to you.
 Do you see what I put up with people?
 Do you see what I put up with?
 Christmas trees and counting.
 We hope you have an amazing week.
