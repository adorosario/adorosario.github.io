<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones.
 Hello.<br/>
 Hello, Mrs Jones.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 I'm good.<br/>
 I'm wondering if our listeners had a great week inviting people over to their houses.
 Oh, yeah.<br/>
 For hospitality.<br/>
 Oh, yeah.<br/>
 We took up on that challenge.<br/>
 Do we take up on that challenge this week?
 Yeah, we did.<br/>
 We had a breakfast.<br/>
 Do you not remember?<br/>
 We did have a breakfast.<br/>
 You killed it.<br/>
 I did. I killed lots of things and then cooked them.
 Yes, you did. Well, I kind of went and hunter gathering it. Whole food didn't really kill anything.
 No. But I did have the spiciest and dewy sausage. It was so hot. I wasn't prepared for it.
 I, that's why I didn't try it. Okay. But if you were a hunter and you lived around our house,
 you could kill deer almost daily. Yeah, there's tons of them. What the heck?
 I know there was four of them on the road today as I was going to. Whole foods.
 I want to see a bear. I don't. How was this week? It was a good week. It was a full week.
 Do you want to talk about your message that you stole from Banning Reacher?
 Well, I gave Banning credit, of course. Well, then that's not stealing, is it? No.
 So I just said I'm borrowing Banning's message on family and what family is,
 which we talked about a couple podcasts ago, didn't we, about personal responsibility and
 and things like that. So I basically, I spent a bit more time on personal responsibility
 and what that looks like practically, but it was fun.
 Because the reaction was very good. It was. And then I was teaching about the Bible this
 week. You were. One of our students, actually, one of our staff, one of our small group leaders
 who was hosting me, she said she was praying and she said, "What if, as Christians in our
 culture, we hunger for the word as much as we did the presence? What if we were as eager
 to get into the word of God as we were the presence of God. And I thought that that is just fantastic.
 Right. So I loved it. I love, I love the word of God. I love being in the word. I love
 teaching on it. And I love teaching students how to read the Bible. And I love how to,
 anyway, I love the whole process. Plus, I set them up on my favorite software for Bible study.
 Yes. So they're all uber nerds. Do you want to say what your favorite software is?
 Well, I have a bunch. But the one I use for study is called a cordance.
 Yeah. I love it. So good.<br/>
 So I was teaching them how to navigate all of that on Mac, Windows and iOS devices.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And it's one of the things that actually they get as being your two students.
 They get, uh, yeah, they do.<br/>
 They get the affordance.<br/>
 We give them that.<br/>
 They get thousands of dollars worth of Bible stuff.
 Yes.<br/>
 For free.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 Um, we had some cool healing test means this morning church.
 Yeah, we did.<br/>
 And healing testimonies.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Do you want to tell them?<br/>
 Well, um, Nathan, I think this was a testimony from last week.
 or the week before.<br/>
 I think it was last week.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Had somehow damaged his Achilles tendon, was in a lot of pain.
 And so he went into the prayer rooms for prayer.
 Yeah, we have healing rooms and prophetic rooms in between our services.
 Yes.<br/>
 And so he went into our healing room for prayer.
 Mm-hmm.<br/>
 And he said it felt like an ice pack was, all of a sudden, on his Achilles tendon, and
 then he could totally move it and it was fine.
 Then somebody this morning upon hearing that testimony,
 uh, chucked their Achilles, which they were having trouble with,
 and it was totally better.<br/>
 I love that.<br/>
 So that's very cool.<br/>
 And then we heard an amazing testimony from Bazz and Rachel Hall.
 Their daughter was playing soccer or football for anybody
 outside of America.<br/>
 And she got tackled and fell and broke her.
 I think she was tripped as opposed to tackled, but, but, you know, either way.
 Well, somebody caused her to trip.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 That's true.<br/>
 What does a tackle, isn't it?<br/>
 No, a tackle means you like jump at the person to take them to the floor.
 I'm pretty sure you're not allowed to do that.
 No, no, no, no, no tackling in soccer is where you go in for the book.
 This much I know.<br/>
 OK.<br/>
 Is where you would slide in for the ball and to kind of tackle the ball away from them,
 but she got tripped in the process.<br/>
 OK.<br/>
 So she fell and broke part of her shoulder, her arm was not.
 She broke the top of her arm at the shoulder like, you know, going into the shoulder joint.
 Well, she didn't know it was broken.<br/>
 She fell was in pain, went straight to a care clinic, the X-rayder, and right enough she
 had broken whichever part of the top of her arm was.
 And so they sent her home, said, "You need to go to an orthopedic place, so they're
 going to have to put you in a full cast, your whole arm from your shoulder."
 So she was super bummed on the way home.
 Her family prayed for her.<br/>
 I'm doing that cliff note.<br/>
 I can see you waiting to jump and go, "No, it wasn't on the way home."
 When they got home.<br/>
 And long story short, her family prayed for her.
 went back the next day to the orthopedic place and they were looking at the x-rays, took more x-rays
 to decide how to set it. And they were all confused, they had a bunch of orthopedic doctors come out
 and nobody could find the break. Which is awesome. Which was absolutely amazing. So they've got
 the before and the after x-rays and then she got, her pain went but she still couldn't move her arm
 and there was no break. But she got more prayer and when she was at home, her family had hands on her
 and it popped and she got full mobility back.
 Went on to win MVP, which stands for most valuable player.
 Thank you.<br/>
 Darling.<br/>
 Well, you and sports.<br/>
 Yes, I know.<br/>
 Thanks.<br/>
 And it was just glorious.<br/>
 I love that testimony.<br/>
 She got to compete in the division.<br/>
 You know, game that she wanted to compete in, which was the bummer for her.
 Not just having the broken thing, but that she wasn't going to be able to play.
 So right.<br/>
 And all the parents were like, wait, didn't she break her arm?
 And so I'm down like, yes, she did.<br/>
 did. But Jesus healed her. Yeah. So, so cool. Such a great testimony. Yeah, that was incredible.
 Yeah. Also incredible. Yes. It was our fall festival. It was so good. Our church every year does a
 festival for fall, hence the name. And, you know, thank you, Darlene. Well, I'm explaining MPP,
 explaining what a fall festival is. A festival for fall. Otherwise known as the fall festival.
 and fall for non-Americans is autumn.<br/>
 Not North Americans. We would call it fall in Canada as well.
 Yes. I just include Canada as America.
 Yeah, don't do that.<br/>
 Now that I'm here.<br/>
 It's a separate nation.<br/>
 I'm glad I end up very long tables in Kentucky.
 Yes. I'm still Canadian, darling.<br/>
 You are.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 I'm still a Canadian permanent resident.
 Yes. Only because you live with me.<br/>
 I know you are like sovereign state.<br/>
 I am.<br/>
 Because I am with you.<br/>
 Everywhere I go, I bring Canada with me.
 I love that.<br/>
 According to the Canadian government.<br/>
 And I get to stay with you.<br/>
 And hence, I'm a important resident of you.
 That's right.<br/>
 Yay.<br/>
 So this house, technically Canada.<br/>
 As far as the Canadians are concerned.
 OK.<br/>
 Is that why we take our shoes off?<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 There's a distinct lack of Tim Hortons.
 If you start making bagels, I'll believe you that you're Canadian.
 It's so hard to make a paleo bagel.<br/>
 I think you should devote all your resources to doing that.
 Forget these drop zones.<br/>
 I want bagels that you'll let me make me bagels woman.
 Well, I was going to make some cashew bread tonight for tomorrow.
 Why?<br/>
 So that we could have some cashew toast with pumpkin cream cheese.
 OK, grab that.<br/>
 Go online, find a paleo bagel recipe.<br/>
 Yeah, come on, paleo bagels.<br/>
 I miss that.<br/>
 Well, now that I've discovered I'm not allergic or intolerant to gluten,
 You're not, but it's not good for you.
 No, it's not, but it tastes so delicious.
 How could it be wrong?<br/>
 But what does it do to you?<br/>
 It makes me grumpy.<br/>
 Makes me happy.<br/>
 Makes you.<br/>
 Makes me one of the seven, four, and those.
 And that's the fall festival.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 You entered the chili cook off.<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 And you were hoping to win.<br/>
 I was.<br/>
 But you were pipped to the post.<br/>
 I was by somebody who'd never made chili before.
 By the young whipper snapper, Noah Benjamin's truth.
 It's true.<br/>
 It's true.<br/>
 It's inherently using his mother's recipe.
 And it was all kinds of different kinds of meat.
 Well, why should we forgive him?<br/>
 Because he gave us steaks to eat for dinner tonight.
 I was going to go for it because Jesus commands us, but fine.
 You go for the more calm reason.<br/>
 Noah works at a great butcher store here in Franklin.
 And so I think he had access to some choice meets that went into his chili.
 Yes.<br/>
 And then he only beat me by one though.
 If I just voted for myself, we would have at least tied.
 Right.<br/>
 And if I voted for you, then you would have won.
 What?<br/>
 Just kidding.<br/>
 I voted for you.<br/>
 Shocking.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 You were number five, right?<br/>
 No.<br/>
 Oh, no, I think was number five.<br/>
 I have voted for Noah.<br/>
 I'm so sorry.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 No, it was really fun.<br/>
 And actually what was great is the number one prize was a barbecue gift.
 I'm not a barbecue fan.<br/>
 What?<br/>
 Yes, you are making barbecue all the time.
 What are you talking about?<br/>
 You don't think I make a barbecue?<br/>
 No, I don't.<br/>
 When you buy skirt steak and you buy, what's the other kind of steak?
 Babe, that's not the same thing as barbecue.
 It's like going out for like greasy pig stuff.
 That's what barbecue is.<br/>
 You don't like brisket?<br/>
 I do.<br/>
 I ate up.<br/>
 What was the barbecue?<br/>
 What's the barbecue place?<br/>
 At least.<br/>
 Right next to my dentist.<br/>
 I got my dentist and I sit in my dentist chair.
 He gets your teeth all nice and clean and then you're like, "I'm going to go."
 and you're like, I'm going to go get barbecue.
 It's not my fault.<br/>
 All I can do is smell barbecue.<br/>
 It's so delicious.<br/>
 So I had, I had Edleys this week.<br/>
 I had the brisket platter.<br/>
 It was so delicious and there is good Alabama sauce.
 I could bathe in the stuff.<br/>
 Is that the red one or the white one?<br/>
 The white one.<br/>
 Oh, it's so good.<br/>
 I don't understand white sauce.<br/>
 Any all the white gravies, this getting gravy with white lumpy?
 No.<br/>
 Mm.<br/>
 Sorry, were you going to say something about the fall festival other than the chili?
 No, I just loved it.<br/>
 But several people commented that there was a price to see me outdoors.
 But it was great.<br/>
 The Allen outside natural environment.
 It was so good seeing everybody and everybody seemed super happy and the kids were thrilled
 and there was s'mores.<br/>
 There was what there was Hershey's chocolate, which I taught my children to avoid
 because it is the plague.<br/>
 And instead there was Reese's Pieces.<br/>
 Good. Yeah.<br/>
 Which is pretty good.<br/>
 in a s'more. Yeah. I've been apart chocolate s'more. I didn't have a s'more. You missed out?
 Well, yeah. S'more would have tanked me, I think. It was fun watching the kids. MJ,
 I think MJ wants his own bouncy castle. Everybody wants your own bouncy castle.
 I mean, he basically would stay on there until they like transferred the new kids in, and then
 he'd join the back of the line and wait to get back on. Yeah, he was a cutie. It was very sweet.
 We're starting a negativity fast tomorrow. So today we can be as negative as we want. In fact,
 this whole podcast negative.<br/>
 I think it's funny it's called a negativity fast, which in and of itself is a negative term.
 What do you mean?<br/>
 The alternate name is a positivity feast. So the goal isn't to not be negative,
 the goal is to be positive. And the byproduct of being positive is that negativity is
 eradicated. If you focus on not being negative and yet not being positive, all you will be is
 is nothing. Well, that's true. That's very true. I think I'm going to find yet again,
 I've only done one or two of these before, and it's harder than fasting food.
 Way to be so positive. Well, babe, first of all, we're not starting until tomorrow,
 but second of all, it is hard when you don't, you, because you start to realize it when
 coming out of your face and if everybody around you is doing the fast with you, it shines a light
 on stuff, which is great. I think the big revelation in just teaching in the last couple of weeks,
 we've been talking about negativity and positivity. The big thing for me is it's not enough to not
 be negative. Not being negative doesn't advance the kingdom of God, but it's actually declaring
 truths in lying with God's kingdom. And so I'm, I think I'm really excited about it.
 The only downside. Wait, are we allowed to have a doubt? I'd still suddenly go ahead.
 Yeah. Was tomorrow night at emanate? I was going to make some observations on the cultural climate
 surrounding the American elections. Yes. But it's almost impossible to do that because I'd have to
 be addressing negativity and we're on a negativity fast. Yeah, tricky. But it's not the negativity
 fast is not seeing an issue. Isn't that one of the things that they tell you? It's not
 being able to see an issue.<br/>
 It is. Yeah, maybe I can still do it. I don't know. I don't entirely know what I want to
 accomplish. I think every time I look at the election situation, or every time I read everybody's
 posts on Facebook or Twitter, or I'm thinking it's got to be a better way than the way we're
 currently approaching it. The difficulties I don't know what that better way is yet,
 but I've been praying about it almost nonstop for a couple of weeks. Just saying, Lord,
 how, how, what's your solution? What's your perspective? Right. Anyway, I guess we'll
 never find out tomorrow because I'm on a negativity fast. Speaking of a negativity
 fast, our topic for this week is it's a little long and a little wordy, but it's bracing
 for impact or believing the best. And it all started with a dream you had this week.
 Did you want to talk about your dream?
</p><ul>
  <li>It did.
 I mean, it kind of all started with me telling you the dream
 and me thinking, "Ha ha ha, wasn't that a funny dream?"
 And then you actually pointing out what the dream was about
 which I had completely missed.
 So I had basically had a dream where you and I were getting,
 we were doing like a rebal thing, you know,
 like, you know, when people hit their 10 year.
  </li><li>A little of love.
  </li><li>Yeah, or their 15 year, whatever.
 So we were gonna do that.
 And a friend of ours was in the dream
 as the person hosting the wedding.
 And so we were at his house and he was saying,
 hey, you can use our summer house for,
 I think it was, he called it a summer house or whatever,
 you know, and the grounds and all this stuff.
 And I was like, oh, okay.
 And then, you know, boom, instantly we're there.
 But the whole way through the dream
 Well, this friend of ours is trying to be lavish.
 I am trying to figure out the Pinterest way
 of doing everything.
  </li><li>What do you mean by that?
  </li><li>Well, like I remember thinking,
 I'm in the dream, I'm talking to Shannon,
 and I'm saying, you know, if we buy cucumbers,
 we could do a bunch of appetizers on cucumbers
 that look really good but aren't as expensive.
 You know, I'm trying to figure out,
 'cause I know there's a lot of people coming,
 and I'm afraid that we can't actually afford to feed them.
 So I'm like trying to think of the cheapest way
 to do everything.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And then, you know, at one point I say to you
 in the dream, you know, could I get a dress?
 You know, and I'm trying to convince,
 like I'm in the dream, I'm like,
 I'll try and find a dress for under 300.
 And if I can't, then I won't, you know,
 and you're like, babe, it's fine.
 Like we're celebrating.
 And the thing was all the way through the dream,
 I didn't know how to celebrate.
 I just knew how to survive something
 or get through an event.
  </li><li>And this friend in the dream
 is an exceptionally wealthy friend
 who keeps course correcting you.
 No, that's not what I mean.
 Like in the dream, he's willing to foot the bill
 for all of this.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And you're not picking up on that.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And even when you do pick up on it,
 you're still setting your sights really, really low.
  </li><li>Right, yeah.
 So at one point, like he comes in while we're talking
 about the food and he's like, no, you don't understand.
 Like we're gonna have an actual meal.
 And so I write away go to,
 which is quite funny, given our previous conversation,
 oh, well, we'll do barbecue, 'cause that's cheap.
 Like it's cheaper to feed people, barbecue, you know.
  </li><li>And you don't even like barbecue.
  </li><li>And I don't like barbecue, but the point was I was,
 yeah, I mean, I was uncomfortable with spending money on me
 or something that I would enjoy.
 And in the whole, in the background,
 I'm thinking about, oh yeah, we get to go on a honeymoon.
 And then I'm thinking, well,
 where's a reasonable place to go and do that?
 Like everything was the downgraded version of something.
 So anyway, we're driving in a church last Sunday morning
 and I'm telling you the dream, just thinking,
 ha ha ha, it wasn't that a weird dream.
 And you said something like, hey,
 So it looks like God's still touching on that thing where you can't be celebrated.
 Right.
 And it never, I didn't put two and two together at all.
 I just thought, huh, random dream, which will be funny to all of our people that
 do dream interpretation, I'm sure.
 But yeah.
 So I've spent some time this week, you know, talking to one or two people.
 I spent some time with my cousin just telling her about how I arrived here and
 crying and I still need to kind of work it through.
 And that dovetailed with my excitement about both Thanksgiving and Christmas.
 Yeah.
 I know it's October, folks.
 Forgive me, but I'm already excited about Christmas.
 And because Christmas is coming, it feels like Thanksgiving is the precursor to Christmas.
 Well, it does help that we have a three-year-old that's counting down days until his birthday
 into Christmas.
 Well, every day he says, "Is it my birthday today?"
 Yeah.
 Well, we'll tell you when it's coming.
 We promise.
 We promise.
 We celebrated Little Johnny Ratliff's birthday, and MJ said,
 he looked around and he was taking notes.
 He was like, "On my birthday, will I get cards?
 On my birthday, will you buy me a birthday present?"
 Oh my God.
 On my birthday, will I get a birthday cake?
 I'm like, "Honey, yep, absolutely you will be celebrated."
  </li><li>Apparently, he told Cindy this morning
 he'd like to have his birthday at Monkey Joes.
 It's the jumping.
 He says, "Can't get enough jumping."
  </li><li>Oh, he just loved jumping.
  </li><li>But the point was, the Lord was just really revealing
 in your heart that you're bracing for impact.
 You're setting your expectations and your sights so low
 so that you can't be disappointed.
 Or in the areas where there's an opportunity to be excited,
 you're still not allowing your heart to go there.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, so not as badly as 10 years ago
 or five years ago kind of thing.
 And the Lord certainly has driven a lot
 to the surface since then, but it's still,
 I think it's still the same source.
 And what's the source?
 Well, I think the source is really losing my dad.
 So I don't have an enormous amount of great memories
 of my dad from when we were little,
 but the one thing that he was great at
 was celebrating things.
 So he was really good at Christmas,
 he was good at birthdays.
 You know, you felt like he wanted to be there.
 He thought about presence.
 Like he really, you know, my love language is gifts.
 So he really thought about,
 like you would open something from him
 and you knew he had seen you see it months before
 and he'd gone back and got it and then hidden it.
 And you know, like he just was great at that kind of stuff.
 And so when he died, our whole family kind of just shut down.
 None of us wanted to celebrate anymore.
 And then when we kind of started trying again,
 it was like this horrible dilapidated version
 of celebration.
  </li><li>Right.
 where it was like, "Well, I got you a bobblehead, Jesus,
 or I got you whatever is the thought that counts."
 And to me, I was like, "Oh, yeah, but there's no thought, so."
  </li><li>It doesn't count.
  </li><li>It doesn't count.
 Like, just give me a card.
 So birthdays, I would say for a good,
 well, until you came on the scene for about 15 years,
 or maybe 10 or 12 years, I can't even remember.
 Let me think, 14 years.
 Birthdays were super painful and Christmas was super painful.
 Like I would just be like, as November is approaching going,
 "Ugh, it's coming."
 Like, and I have to survive this.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>And so I would just, I couldn't wait until January 1st
 and we were finally past having to look happy.
  </li><li>But you're not like that anymore.
 I haven't seen that side of you, but the residue is still there.
  </li><li>There's still something going on in my heart
 where I realize that I'm heading into the holiday season
 And there's still something that God wants to out in my heart about being able to celebrate.
 Meanwhile, I'm on the other side of the fence going, "I can't wait!"
 And I'm making my list of things to do with the girls and MJ.
 And I'm thinking about this year's going to be the first year.
 I think the first year that we're home for Thanksgiving.
 Yeah. In many years.
 So I'm excited to think about that.
 Yeah, me too. And we have double ovens.
 And we have double ovens. You can cook two turkeys at once.
 Well, it wasn't really I was thinking about the vegetables being able to be
 cooked in something different.
 Yeah, vegetables think Pavlova.
 Ooh, ooh, now you're talking.
 Yeah, I, you know, I can get excited for the kids.
 Out of girl. No, but I mean, like I can, I can get excited because they're going
 to love it. And so.
 And actually, I want to be excited.
 I used to be the kind of person that would start listening to Christmas music in July.
 like so glad the Lord fixed that. Right. But I mean, yeah, so anyway, just realizing that
 there's still, there's still stuff that the Lord wants to free my heart from the residue of.
 Well, it's interesting, you know, back to this positivity feast. Yeah. When Jeff is preaching this
 one, he quoted one of my favorite people, Chip Jaz, and he said, "Your life will not go any place
 your words have not gone first." So the antidote to your predicament is all these declarations or
 Proclamations about how good Christmas is going to be, how good your birth is going to be,
 how good Thanksgiving is going to be.
 Yeah.
 And actually setting an expectation for your heart to follow.
 Yeah.
 And I mean, you had an amazing birthday last year.
 I did.
 And I didn't know how to process it.
 And that just registered as trauma to you, didn't it?
 Well, yeah, it did.
 And then, you know, afterwards being able to go, "Oh, wow.
 I don't actually want to register good things as trauma anymore.
 So that's been an ongoing thing that the Lord's been talking to me about this year anyway.
 I think the cool thing is with Jeff calling the negativity fast or the positivity feast
 that heads me all the way through my birthday and through Thanksgiving.
 So it's great to have to align with what God's saying
 rather than previous scenarios.
 And I think probably--
 I mean, I don't imagine I'm the only person that
 goes into the holiday season bracing for impact,
 for lack of a better word.
 But I think there is a challenge for all of us to just be able to go in believing that God is who he says he is and that he's good and that there's blasting waiting for us in the midst of something that maybe before hasn't been the most fun time for us during the year.
 Well, I think that that truth is applicable in a wider sense and just celebrating.
 Like, I think the way we face life, are we bracing for impact?
 Or are we actually believing God's going to meet us in this day with an amazing thing?
 Sure.
 So I would challenge our listeners who are listening right now.
 Like, what are you facing and what are you having an expectation for?
 Yeah.
 Like, what is on the other side of this podcast?
 Are you listening to this on the way to work?
 What is your expectation for your day?
 Like, are you on a plane going somewhere?
 What's your expectation for when you land?
 And that whole thing of actually having an expectation that God is going to meet us
 and upgrade whatever we're facing is a fascinating way of looking at life.
 Yeah.
 And I think you end up with the results of that.
 Yeah, you, of course you do.
 Yeah.
 It's the whole belief expectation cycle.
 What, what you believe and what you declare sets out a red carpet for anything to land on.
 So if you're expecting negative things, you will reap negative things.
 And if you're expecting and declaring positive things, more often than not,
 That's what you're finding the fruit returns to you.
 Yeah.
 Um, and I think that's one of the keys that people don't understand in living
 this abundant life is having an expectation.
 But the funny thing is, I think people think, well, I would have an expectation
 of good stuff happened to me.
 But my point to that is good stuff has already happened to you.
 Right.
 And you can insert an expectation anywhere you want.
 You don't have to wait for good stuff to happen.
 You can't live by your circumstances.
 You have to live by the promises that God's given you.
 Right.
 And at first that feels fraudulent.
 Do you remember when we did our ungodly beliefs and they give you these godly beliefs?
 And the godly beliefs seem far-fetched.
 Yeah.
 They're like, you don't believe any of this.
 Well, you declare it so that you do believe it.
 Our friend surprises us in the West.
 You see it, then you believe it, but we believe it, then we see it.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So that's the challenge, isn't it?
 It is the challenge.
 So maybe it's birthdays, maybe it's Thanksgiving, maybe it's Christmas, but maybe it's
 promotion, maybe it's relationships, maybe it's
 an outcome that you're waiting to hear.
 Maybe it's who knows what it is, but examine the fruit of your expectations
 and determine are you bracing for impact or is there an opportunity for the Holy
 Spirit to come along and go, Hey, why don't we believe the best and see what would
 happen?
 Yeah.
 Yeah, I think that's good, babe.
 Thank you to everybody who's written in with listeners questions.
 The listeners questions we've been getting of late are uniquely personal
 questions that don't scale up well to public audiences answering them on air.
 Yeah. Well, what I mean by that there,
 there rather than being these kind of broad, easy to answer questions that
 would be generally applicable answers, there are very specific pastoral issues,
 which there's no way we can answer responsibly without knowing the person of the
 situation. So if you've not heard us answering your question, we're really sorry, it's probably
 a question that's better suited to your pastor.
 Somebody who knows you.
 Yeah, rather than somebody over in there. But thank you for sending them in. I appreciate
 that. If you want to join in with the 40 day positivity feast that we're doing at Grace
 Center, you might want to get Steve and Wendy back on the book called Igniting Faith in
 40 days. They are sold out on Bethel store because we bought all the copies. But you
 can download the PDF or you can get it on Kindle. I'll put links in the show notes to
 them. If you want to join in with us for the next 40 days and see what happens.
 Yeah, I'm super excited. We'll be able to talk about it for the next couple of weeks
 and just sort of say what we're seeing happen. Which is great. Just before we let you go
 for the day. I just want to remind you that we have heaven declares coming up at the end
 of October at Grace Center. And we have Jamie Galloway coming in as well as Lafe Hetland
 and Andy Squires is leading worship.
 I'm really looking forward to meeting Andy Squires.
 Same.
 I missed him last time we were here at Grace Center because we were away mastering.
 Yeah.
 But when we came back, everybody was talking about how awesome he was and he seems like
 a great dude. I can't wait to meet him.
  </li><li>Yeah, and it'll be fun to tell Jamie
 about all the different things that he prophesied over us
 that have all come true since the last time he was here.
  </li><li>Last time Jamie was here, he gave us a prophetic word
 and all of us come to pass.
  </li><li>Which is amazing.
  </li><li>I should give him a taco.
  </li><li>Yeah, let's buy him a one, just one taco.
  </li><li>I think this is Minister's statement,
 we'll prophesy for tacos.
  </li><li>Oh, pep, it's a taco.
  </li><li>The other thing is gonna say
 if you are not living in a Franklin Nashville area
 and you're like, oh, thanks for telling us
 about all these awesome conferences that are happening,
 you can join us, we have a live stream for the conference.
 If you go to greycenter.us, you'll find information
 that and I will put links in the show notes to the conference information but we'd love
 you to join us. We think it's going to be an incredible conference. We love doing them
 every year. Yeah. Apart from that, have a glorious week filled with positivity. Yeah.
 Identify the areas you're embracing for impact and start believing the best. Have a good
 week.
