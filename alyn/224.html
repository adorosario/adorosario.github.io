<p> I live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes, sir.<br/>
 Let's not talk about sadness this week.
 OK.<br/>
 Let's talk about my desire to get a dog.
 No.<br/>
 No to talking about it or no to getting one.
 Babe, we can't have a dog.<br/>
 Because you're a monster who hates small, durable animals
 that just bring joy to little children.
 I would love to have a dog.
</p><ul>
  <li>And it's settled.
 That ladies and gentlemen, that's how you do.
  </li><li>We're not getting a dog.
 First of all, Kate, who lives with us,
 is a legit two dogs.
  </li><li>But I have a plan.
  </li><li>Oh dear.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I've been finding Pet Dander
 and I'm slowly leaving it around her living space
 and just watching her build up tolerance to it.
 It's a genius plan.
  </li><li>Okay, and you also had the children pray for her
 to be healed of her allergy.
  </li><li>And now I'm accusing her of having a lack of faith.
 (laughs)
 So what are you gonna do about the fact that once we're not in quarantine,
 our lifestyle is a horrible, horrible lifestyle to have a dog?
 Well, I'm gonna do one of those things where like, I'm gonna change the working policy at Grace Center,
 and it's like, bring your dogs to work. And so like, the dog's gonna come with me everywhere,
 and she's gonna become an extension of my personality. It's gonna be great.
 Don't bother me with details. That will not work. Our lives are not good for a dog.
 Maybe later in life, like 20 years from now.
 What's going to happen in 20 years from now?
 Well, I'll be nearly 70.
 And so we could retire and get a dog.
 OK, so there is a Instagram account that I just I'm not really a dog person.
 I had a dog grown up, but I had a dog.
 I had two different dogs.
 Sorry.
 Is this your monologue?
 Sorry.
 I didn't know you were monologuing.
 I thought only evil masterminds actually did monologues.
 Okay.
 On Friday, somebody tweeted out a link to this Instagram thing about this dog's life is better
 than the rest of ours, you know, put together.
 Yeah, if you look at the account, it is.
 So I, you know, I just was interested, went to this dog and fell in love with this, this
 breed of dog called a Vishla.
 I'm not sure if I'm saying that pronounced or pronouncing that correctly.
 It's V.I.S. Z.L.A. I think, Vishla.
 I don't know.
 It's a Hungarian sporting dog and they're absolutely beautiful.
 I was like, you know what my life needs right now is a dog.
 And, you know, maybe my desire for dog is just an antidote
 to having to feel my feelings.
 I'm like, you know what, let's get a dog.
 Don't let me distract you.
 Oh. (laughs)
 You jumped to that conclusion.
  </li><li>Oh, I'm sorry. - Yeah.
 So we're not getting a dog, but I'm dreaming
 about having a dog.
  </li><li>Yeah, maybe one day.
  </li><li>When you're 70.
  </li><li>Well, maybe it'll happen before then,
 but it would have to be sometime after the season
 where we can actually be gone from our house
 for eight hours in a row
 and that poor little thing will have to be in a box.
  </li><li>No, I think it comes with me and it's great.
 And you know.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>No, all right.
  </li><li>I love dogs in restaurants and things.
 I mean, this will work great.
  </li><li>I've got it.
 I'm gonna poke both my eyes out.
 It could be a seeing dog.
  </li><li>Probably not a dog right now, huh?
 Okay.
 Do you wanna tell them what you told the children?
 Do you wanna tell them how you threw me under the bus
 with the children?
  </li><li>I don't remember doing that.
  </li><li>You did.
  </li><li>Okay. - Yesterday you were like,
 "Well guys, you know, yeah,
 "'cause you were talking to Moira at a dog."
 And then you're like, "Mommy's the holdout.
 "Mommy won't want to die."
  </li><li>I don't remember saying that.
 I just remember pointing out how unreasonable you were
 with all your like, "We have to wait till you're 70."
 I'm just hoping that the lifestyle came with a dog.
 Like I'll put a link in the show notes
 to this Instagram account
 and it's just this young gorgeous fit outdoor couple.
 Are they in the Rockies?
 Nowhere are they there?
  </li><li>Somewhere in Canada.
  </li><li>I'm somewhere in Canada and I was just like,
 oh, this is a life we want.
  </li><li>Well, right.
  </li><li>And we'll never have, because we live
 in a completely different part of the world.
  </li><li>And neither one of us like kayak
 or do you have the things in those kayak?
  </li><li>You used to kayak?
  </li><li>No, I've never kayaked.
  </li><li>That's the most portaging.
  </li><li>Canoeing.
  </li><li>Kayak, canoeing, they both begin with the same letter.
 It's fine.
  </li><li>Yes, well, sort of.
 Yeah.
 No, it's not the same letter.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I was waiting for you to pick me up on that.
 I threw it to you.
 I set it up for you and nothing.
  </li><li>I was like, so wait, wait.
  </li><li>Well, today we're talking about a feeling
 we spent most of the week trying to avoid.
 It's gonna be sadness.
  </li><li>Sadness.
  </li><li>On our journey of our feelings,
 we've covered hurt, we've covered lonely,
 and we're now into sad.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Now, you're probably thinking why?
 Why Jones, why in the middle of a global pandemic
 are you wanting to talk about sadness?
 That's what I'm thinking right now.
 Why Jones? Why?
  </li><li>Because if you want a rich full life,
 you can't have a rich full life without having sadness.
 And you're thinking, I'll give him my best shot.
  </li><li>No, yeah, let me try.
  </li><li>Well, but seriously, just before we unpack why that is,
 think about today, like how has your heart been
 with sadness today?
  </li><li>Very present with my sadness.
  </li><li>I would say that you've been spending
 most of your time away from sadness.
  </li><li>Well, I'm aware of it.
 And so I'm trying to, I'm present in that I'm aware it's right there and I'm avoiding.
 Feeling sad.
 Yes.
 Okay.
 So let me ask you, what's the quality of your life when you avoid your sadness that you were aware of?
 I still feel sad.
 And the quality of your life would be like what?
 Frustrating.
 Right.
 Okay.
 So, so, and this is the kind of dichotomy, like we talked a little bit about this that this week,
 we both felt really sad just before we started recording.
 I cried.
 You were talking about feeling sad.
 And so I thought you just eloquently said that.
 Like I'm aware of my sad, but I don't want to pay attention to my sad.
 So I'm reading a lot.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So so you're not actually feeling your sadness, so to speak, you're aware that it's there
 but you're choosing to ignore it.
 And as a result, you're living a substandard quality of life.
 Yeah.
 So so it's so funny that we think like if I don't have to feel the sadness, my life will
 be better, but actually it's just a really.
 Well, it's still there.
 The second you stop reading or stop eating something crunchy or stop.
 Whatever playing a video game, it's still there.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So that the attempt of getting through life without having to really feel your
 sadness produces a substandard quality of life.
 Like I wouldn't say that today is being your best day just from an external perspective.
 No, right.
 You don't seem brimming with your usual joy.
 That's true.
 Yeah.
 "Oh, you just stabbed me on the table."
  </li><li>I did not, I can't even reach you,
 but I'll try and stab you if you like.
  </li><li>The reason for that is when we are not prepared
 to feel our sadness,
 we actually become an inauthentic version of ourself.
 We deny what's actually going on.
 We separate ourselves from that sadness
 and we become like a lesser version of ourself
 who is like getting through life
 rather than enjoying life.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think this week I'm just super aware
 of how not in control I am.
 Like in terms of, we've just had lots of sad news
 and as pastors you hear that
 and you carry the people that are going through hard things.
 And I can't change those things for those people.
 So I just feel really sad.
 'Cause I wanna, I guess I wanna help or I wanna fix it.
 I know I can't do any of those things.
 So, yeah.
  </li><li>I'm left with an awareness that life isn't fair.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Or life isn't going the way I would like it to go.
  </li><li>Yeah, or going the way that I'd like it to go
 for other people.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so I'm aware there's this.
 And so because this is here,
 I'm gonna go over here and avoid this.
  </li><li>Yes, I'd like to.
  </li><li>Right.
 And the trouble is when we do that,
 when we like are aware of our sadness,
 but won't feel it,
 we actually shut down a part of our heart.
 We become less vibrant with our own hearts,
 which means it's impossible to be vibrant
 with other people's hearts too.
 Which is like the sad news about sadness.
 This could be a really interesting podcast.
  </li><li>There's sad news about sadness.
  </li><li>And by interest, I mean--
  </li><li>And that's where they turn us off.
 Sorry, folks. - Bye-bye.
  </li><li>See ya, have a nice week.
 We'll see you next week when we talk about happy,
 but just kidding. (laughs)
  </li><li>The whole thing about sadness,
 do you need a moment to dry your eyes?
  </li><li>I have a leak.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Bless.
 right. I'm so glad I redid my makeup. Not the thing about like I was so mad. I think I was kind
 of okay with chips books. I got to the chapter on sad and then I was really really mad about
 sad and now I'm rhyming because you could make that into a rap or something. No, you don't want
 see me rap because no.
 I'm not upset.
 Sorry.
 I can't know myself.
 Okay.
 For about two years, when we would ever do a mic check before we start recording, instead
 of just going check, check one, two, like we would not want to do, age even insist on
 rapping or human beatboxing.
 And for about here, I collected all of those various.
 But he didn't tell me that.
 And then one year I surprised her with a hip-hop.
  </li><li>A song kind of made out of--
  </li><li>Well, I think that's an insult to songwriters everywhere.
 It was a collection of you making noise.
  </li><li>Strange noises, yeah.
  </li><li>Anyway, what were we talking about?
  </li><li>Sadness.
  </li><li>My refusal to want to feel sad.
 Yeah, in reading shows book,
 'cause John 1010 is one of my favorite verses,
 like I've come and give you life and life abundant.
 And I was like, well, life abundant means I should
 never have to feel sad again.
  </li><li>Yes.
 notion that Chip was suggesting that actually whole-hearted living, like full-hearted living
 includes sadness, I was like, "No, no, no. Sadness is an enemy of feeling alive. Let's kick it out."
 But actually, that's you unprepared to live life the way it is because, as we looked at last week,
 Jesus said, "In this life you will have many troubles." So sadness is a part of life. And
 I just live my life refusing to want to feel sadness, which in turn gave me like a shut down
 What are you grinning at?
 I'm just like, I just had a thought of like, I think maybe, uh, we can, you can maybe correct me if I'm wrong.
 But I'm like, I think I'm making progress because before I would just quote a scripture verse at my sadness and then get back back,
 foul beast back.
 And then just completely be like, I'm fine because I quoted a scripture verse at it.
 And I'm more than a conquering Christ.
 Now I'm actually feeling it, but then I'm also reading to avoid feeling it when it gets too big.
 Right.
 So maybe I haven't made progress.
 Oh, it's all baby steps, isn't it?
 At least you're aware it's here.
 Yeah.
 And you're aware I'm avoiding it.
 Yeah.
 That's better than the denial that I've been living in before,
 where I'm like, nope, I'm fine.
 Everything's OK.
 Well, why are you crying?
 It's all good.
 Just suck it up.
 Do you want something that's really depressing,
 but is actually quite cheery?
 Depressing but cheery.
 Well, listen to this.
 I'm terrified.
 I know it's easier if I just read it.
 OK.
 This is from Chip's book.
 And this is from the chapter on Sadness.
 He says this, "Sadness is the feeling
 that speaks to how much you value what is missed, what is gone, and what is lost.
 It also speaks of how deeply you value what you love, what you have, and what you live.
 So when I said that was like, how did I describe it? Sad, depressing, beautiful, genius at the same time.
 It's that whole, the truth about life that I just didn't want to face.
 See, Chip says, Sadness is the feeling that speaks to how much you value what is missed, what is gone, and what is lost.
 The reason I've never wanted to think about what I've missed what is gone is what is lost is when I think about those things
 I don't have warm feelings. I have like sad feelings
 Yeah, so as a result of never want to look backwards
 I prize myself on being like present future oriented like I never want to look back as a result historically
 I've not been a very what's that called sentimental person like I don't have photos around my house
 I don't have trinkets that mean things to me
 When my when my both my parents died I went back to the house with my sisters and we spent the whole week
 like unpacking everything and you know packing up everything rather and my sisters like do you want this do you want that I didn't want anything and
 And now I have sadness about not wanting anything
 Not that I didn't get anything because I could still get stuff my sister got a ton of it
 But the fact that I didn't want anything now makes me sad like my heart was like
 I don't want to be reminded of any of this because I if I know if I think about these things
 I will feel sad and I don't want to feel sad.
 So get behind me Satan.
 Does that make sense?
 Yeah, that makes sense.
 But when I read Chip's book, what I realized was that without my sadness,
 I don't actually get to cherish that, which is precious.
 Yeah, or honor that, which is precious.
 Yeah, or hold on to it or even be in touch with what I value.
 Yeah, I don't actually get the treasure of what I've missed, which then makes me sad, sad.
 I realized that I was kind of sabotaging myself.
 Like my, I didn't let my heart encounter the tenderness that comes from
 cherishing beautiful memories or the gladness that you once had,
 because I was thinking, well, I can't have them now.
 So why bother reminiscing and when I had them?
 So it's like, it's like cutting off your nose, despite your face.
 Like, I won't think about the memories I had then because I can't have them now.
 Like, I'm going to refuse to live now because I can't relive what I had back then.
 But like, think about the beauty of what your experience, think about the beauty of the past,
 think about all the treasured memories that I was refusing to access because I just don't want to feel sad.
 Yeah, I totally get it.
 That also means without sadness, huge parts of me are not present.
 Like basically my whole history.
 Is that making sense?
 I'm not trying to be overly metaphorical.
 No, it does make sense.
 I think I think you and I have done that part a little different.
 Like in terms of, I do have some stuff and I have a bunch of stuff for my dad that I look through every once in a while and you know,
 like newspaper clippings and all that kind of stuff.
 And I, to begin with, I kept them but couldn't look at them.
 Wow.
 And why couldn't you look at them?
 Oh, because I felt desperately sad.
 If you looked at them.
 Well, because my dad took his life.
 Right.
 Right. It's it's to me. It doesn't feel the same. I don't like I don't want to I'm you know to me doesn't feel the same because he chose it. Yes
 So to begin with I think there was so much anger mixed in with the sadness that I was like I want to keep these for later
 When I'm not wanting to burn them like when I'm not right
 But I mean I I looked at them a couple months ago came down the basement and looked through all the articles and
 Have some of his swimming medals and all that kind of stuff and now it's
 Glad with sadness. Yeah talk to me about that
 So I was just gonna ask do you mind if I ask like what did you feel when you looked at the stuff from your dad?
 Well now I'm able to look at them and go wow I still really miss you, but I remember when
 You know like I can cherish it as opposed to
 be like somewhere in the basement. There's a box of
 One day I get to that so yeah, it's different now than it was
 sadness has this proportional value to it in
 That the greater something meant to us the larger the sadness when we lose it
 Yeah, for sure so basically you're saying the amount of sadness we have about something points to how important it was to us
 Right talks about the value of what we lost because sadness is always about loss sadness is all about what we've lost I remember when I was in
 why I went to why I went to three years after my dad killed himself.
 And I was frustrated that I was still sad, that I was still grieving.
 And I remember talking to the bass leader and just saying,
 like we were in Honduras, standing in a puddle somewhere,
 and totally got in touch with how angry I was.
 &gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
 &gt;&gt; And he said, AJ, I'm not sure you've ever grieved.
 Wow. And I was like, I just lost it, started yelling at this poor man.
 And I was like, how long do I have to crave for?
 It's been three years, you know, how long do I have to feel this way?
 And he's like, well, I, uh, you might just want to think about like,
 you're, you're probably going to feel this way for a while.
 And how long did you love him for?
 Right. And I was like, uh, cause I was 21, 22 at the time.
 He's like, it might be at least that long before,
 before the grieving stops.
 And I thought, well, that's horrible news.
 And I don't really feel like it played out like that.
 But in looking back, I didn't even let myself
 grieve in the first place.
 'Cause I wasn't, I couldn't feel,
 I was overwhelmed by sadness.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And overwhelmed by anger.
 And I just thought.
  </li><li>You don't get any more.
  </li><li>No, not doing it.
  </li><li>Nope.
 We're going to talk about grief momentarily and the importance that sadness plays in the journey of grief.
 But you're touching on something that like if we are going to be committed to living a full, rich, open life,
 then we are signing up for huge amounts of sadness.
 Because the more you open up your heart to people, things, opportunities, places,
 the more we engage with things, the more we love, the more we value,
 then the greater the loss we're going to feel when they go or when things happen to them
 that might not be our wishes.
 Well, I remember after dad died, I would assess everything based on the danger of falling in
 love with something or someone again or letting somebody close because I assessed everything
 at the loss.
 Right.
 So I'd be like, Oh, you seem really cool.
 We could be friends.
 But when that ends, that's going to cost me something.
 You know, however it ends.
 you know, because at the time it felt like everything ended, you know?
 And so I would assess everything at it's going to cost me something to lose that.
 So I'm not signing up for loss. So then I just didn't have anything.
 I didn't have any real relationship.
 So you wouldn't have to suffer loss. Yes.
 But then you're absolutely completely alone.
 Yeah. I would largely agree that without the probably degree of intensity that
 you're describing, I realized that large portions of my life were lived
 detached because if I have to attach and I have to lose you, I don't want to deal with
 the pain.
 So it's just safer.
 I mean, that's ridiculous.
 It's not safer.
 You know, there's no safety in that at all.
 It's more stunted.
 Even like we were joking about getting a dog, like part of my decision tree yesterday was
 like, oh, look at that dog.
 It's beautiful.
 I really like to get a dog.
 No dogs die.
 I don't feel sad about having a dog died.
 I'm not going to get a dog.
 You did say that.
 Like I did that in like a millisecond.
 Yeah.
 Like I don't want to open up my and I was like, oh, and again, this is like, oh, I'm going
 It's weird that we're recording this episode this week because this week has been very hard in regard to the amount of
 sadness that we feel related to our job and related to people we love and things that are happening and
 You know the global pandemic and all that stuff. I don't know where this fits in babe, but maybe it doesn't maybe we take this out
 But even as you know as we were just talking I thought actually you know
 We've done some talking on the podcast about ungodly beliefs, right?
 and how your life writes a story
 and you start to believe these things.
 And I was talking about just a second ago
 about assessing whether I would get close to somebody
 based on what it would cost me when they leave.
 One of my main ungodly beliefs was if I love him
 specifically, he will leave.
 Because of course, dad left and my first husband left.
 And I realized like I held all men back
 because the potential for pain.
 And I was actually able to connect with women
 because they hadn't caused as much pain.
 But I still assessed everybody based.
 I would assess like how far I would let them in
 based on what it would cost me when they hurt me, not if.
  </li><li>The threshold of pain I'm gonna experience, let me rank you.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And then give you access to my life
 according to your pain threshold.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Wow, I'm really glad that you got ministry
 for that particular ungodly belief before I met you.
  </li><li>Yeah, don't mind.
  </li><li>I also think about our story and our engagement
 that at one point in our engagement,
 I was actually at many points for our engagement.
 I was having this internal struggle of like,
 I'm making a mistake, it's not right.
 I don't wanna marry another man's wife.
 You know, I'm wrecking her life and wrecking my life.
 I'm honest, I'd be like a yo-yo like one day.
  </li><li>'Cause you didn't know if I was supposed to be your wife.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>This thought I would say you must marry her.
  </li><li>Well, I was filled with fear and I was totally chicken
 and I basically want God to make my decisions for me,
 rather than honoring my own heart, yada, yada, yada.
 And I remember at one point,
 one of your friends just asked me in the car.
 And I just-- - We were driving
 to Christa's wedding.
  </li><li>Yeah, and I answered, and then the car went quiet.
 But I still think about your reaction.
 You didn't disconnect what you thought was my disconnection,
 like you stayed present.
 You had enough resolve with the Lord, where,
 I mean, I remember you being largely okay with me not being okay, which was such a gift to me.
 But I was, I mean, I was only okay with you not being okay and sort of sign-waving
 because I had heard really clearly from the Lord.
 And you'd worked on your ungodly beliefs.
 Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
 So I guess it just didn't trigger what normally would have, what normally would have triggered.
 Yeah.
 Gosh, our stories are crazy at writing the events of our life.
 You know, like events happen and then we write a story about them
 and the events are true, but the story we write are probably not.
 Probably hugely, I mean, not probably,
 are definitely hugely influenced by our pain
 that we've already experienced unusually,
 are unprocessed pain.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So, Ajay, why are we,
 why are we open to feeling sad?
  </li><li>Because every feeling has a gift.
  </li><li>And please, for the love of all it's holy,
 tell me the gift of feeling sad.
 The gift of feeling sad is acceptance.
 That sounds like the worst gift ever.
 Does it come with a gift receipt?
 Can I give it back?
 Like, hey, I got this gift and I have a gift receipt.
 Can I trade it in for something better?
 So the gift of feeling sad is acceptance.
 That sounds sucky.
 Yes, it does sound sucky.
 So could you explain why it's a good thing?
 Like why acceptance is a good thing?
 I'm not sure I can.
 I mean, I can't explain because I've read
 Chipsburg and I've done Chips courses and I have
 experienced a measure of the goodness of feeling sad, like
 genuinely, I have received the gift of acceptance. If we back up a
 little bit, like feeling sad opens the doorway to healing. So the
 reason we're feeling sad is we have suffered loss. If we sit
 with our sadness, if we allow sadness to accompany us on the
 path of grief, we're talking about grief earlier, the end
 result of that of doing our work around our sadness, doing the
 work around the grief of what we've lost is eventually we come to accept life on
 life's terms. Now let me explain what we mean by life on life's terms because
 that's another phrase where when I heard Chip talk about that I was like I don't
 have to accept life on life's terms because I have Jesus. That's right I'm
 an overcomer. And he's gonna upgrade everything again like my understanding
 of that is is Jesus is gonna make sure I never have to feel anything at you know
 negative at all. Right. Which we're never promised. Never promised or never was a
 demonstrate it. So if you think about Jesus as best friend Lazarus dying and
 Mary and Martha being really sad, I would read that story and go yeah but you get
 to the end of Jesus' Rosar for the dead, yay! And I'm like yeah but for the four
 days he left and there he didn't tell Mary and Martha, guys don't worry this is
 what's gonna happen, he just left them in their sadness, in their grief. And so
 yes in one sense Jesus is gonna make all things new but that's in the next
 life and sometimes in this life before we get to see the miracle of what happened
 we have to walk through the deep sadness of what has.
 And sometimes, sometimes the why, that the question,
 why is an answered decide of eternity?
 And so we have to be prepared with what do we do
 when we don't get the answers we want?
 What do we do when life isn't on our terms?
 Like life on life's terms.
 Yeah.
 And see, the gift of acceptance is acceptance allows you
 to continue living with the absence of what you loved.
 Without acceptance, you refuse to live
 without what you've lost,
 which means you either have to turn to denial.
 It's not that bad, it doesn't matter.
 You know, I don't need a dad, I don't need a mom.
 I'm fine, it's fine, or delusion.
 All right, remember, you actually literally moved to state
 where you refused to believe your dad had died.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And then the police had to be called
 because you were hallucinating.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Remember that part?
  </li><li>I do, I remember that.
  </li><li>Tell the kids that story.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I don't think the kids wanna hear that story.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>But acceptance, or like this is how life actually is,
 it does something wonderful for us.
 living acceptance helps us find what we need.
 Like the most annoying question, as you know, being married to me is,
 is there something you need? Is there anything you need?
 Do you know what you need?
 What do you need? Like, I've got asked that for years and years and years.
 And I'm like, I hate.
 And the reason I hated that question is I didn't know the answer.
 And the reason I didn't know the answer to what I need is you'll never know
 what you need until you felt your feelings.
 And I'm right.
 And in your sadness, it leads you to acceptance.
 Like, this is how my life is.
 And out of the reality of how my life is, I can identify what I need.
 And what I need might be, I need somebody just to listen to me, or I actually need help,
 or I need to move on, or I need to do something in remembrance, or I need to, but you will
 discover whatever that is by sitting with your sadness, leading you to acceptance.
 What's the difference between acceptance and trust?
 Because I think I move probably too quickly to trust to get away from actually, I bypass
 the identifying my need.
 So I can just go, okay, well, I don't get it, but I trust you, God, and move into trust
 without actually identifying if there was a need in the midst of it.
 It's interesting because I wonder if trust is actually the best word for what you're
 describing there.
 Okay.
 I wonder.
 I can think of times when I've moved to trust where I basically say I'm trusting God, but
 it's actually a great ace card to say I don't have to be present with my feelings.
 Right.
 saying like I know times like there's so many things that I feel like oh I don't
 have an answer for that I don't have an answer for why life went down that way
 but I do honestly trust God like I write you know I mean so I do move to I'm not
 saying in every circumstance and I'm trying to feel my feelings now and all
 that kind of stuff but sometimes I literally just sort of flip into okay
 you got, I don't get this. I do feel sad, but I trust you. Yeah, that sounds like acceptance.
 That it's a different kind of acceptance, maybe, but I wonder if it I wonder if I'm stopping
 the process short in that I'm not actually then saying, you know, do I have any need
 in this moment? Right. I'm trusting or I'm accepting, but maybe there's also a place to
 go in this trust and acceptance. Here's what I hear. Here's what I need, Lord. That's
 Beautiful. Yeah, I don't know.
 Sounds like something to journal about.
 Does, doesn't it?
 Dang it.
 Journaling it never ends.
 I think too, it's
 part of why we don't want to feel our sadness is we've been trained not to.
 You know, we've been trained to think that feeling sadness, maybe particularly
 as victorious Christians, that feeling sadness is weakness.
 You know, that it's like if we really knew
 how big God was or whatever that we would, we wouldn't feel sad.
 Right.
 Somehow that by feeling sad, you're faithless because God is good all the time.
 That's right.
 Oh, all the time.
 God is good.
 Now, here's the thing I firmly believe that God is good.
 Absolutely.
 And life is hard.
 Yes.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 What does it chips says?
 Chip's got this great phrase where he says that life is tragic, but God is faithful.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 And those two go together.
 So true.
 And I wish that life wasn't tragic, but like,
  </li><li>Totally.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>This week is a great week for us of like,
 oh yeah, there's lots of tragedy happening.
  </li><li>Lots of tragic.
  </li><li>And God is faithful and sometimes you seemingly
 can't reconcile those two things and you know
 that one has to trump the other and that one
 trumping the other doesn't mean you don't have to feel
 your feelings about the bit you don't understand.
 Does that make any sense?
  </li><li>Right, right.
 I think what we prefer to do is move away from our feelings.
 don't wait by maybe putting band-aids on it,
 like whether it's scripture versus or,
 you know, handy sayings.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Oh, so many handy sayings.
 There's a whole industry,
 Christian industry about handy sayings.
 You know, like, so you lose, you know,
 that we've had horror stories of parents losing their children
 and the best comfort that Christians can come up with
 is like, God must have needed your baby more than you did,
 you know, heaven must have needed another angel.
  </li><li>It's just awful.
  </li><li>And it's totally awful.
 and horrible theology.
  </li><li>It's also people who haven't felt their feelings
 about that, so they're like, okay, here,
 there we go. - We wanna move away
 from our feelings.
 I don't wanna feel this.
 So I'm gonna try and make you stop feeling
 what you're feeling.
  </li><li>So that we can all get back on with life.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And it's like, it's horrible.
 And the truth is to recognize, yes, God is good,
 and sometimes life is hard.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And so God is faithful and God is glorious.
 God is as good as He is great.
 Like, you know, I preach probably my core messages,
 the goodness of God.
 Yes.
 And I get to feel sad.
 And my sadness doesn't come into the expense
 of his goodness.
 Yeah, it doesn't diminish it at all.
 See, the thing is, if we don't make room for our sadness
 along with God's goodness,
 then we build up this facade
 that we're like this super Christian
 that we're no longer human
 and that nothing by any means can cause us to feel sad.
 We start twisting scripture
 to make this austere presentation of that,
 like I talked about last week,
 like I'm Teflon.
 and everything just bounces off me.
 Nothing can stick to me.
  </li><li>And then you feel like Teflon
 when other people are trying to connect to you
 because you're not touchable, you're not real.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's so true babe,
 because you end up not only hiding behind your sadness,
 but as you remove away from your own self,
 feeling hurt at the same time,
 you remove away from a relationship with others too.
 And they might recognize it,
 but you might not be able to acknowledge it like,
 "No, I'm fine, no, no,
 "I'm just not one of those needy people."
 And you're like, "Oh."
 which again, I'm not saying this as a judgment against other people.
 I'm talking about this as a description of myself.
 Yes, we've done this.
 Yeah.
 So we've talked about feeling sad, the gift is acceptance.
 We've talked about like sadly in our culture, we've been trained out of feeling sad because
 it looks like faithlessness.
 And hey, the reason you're feeling sad is you just don't know how good God is.
 That's right.
 Yariyariyara.
 Read my scripture, memorize it.
 If we do that, we remove ourselves from ourselves and from a relationship.
 And if we refuse to feel our feelings about sadness,
 we end up with this impairment
 and the impairment of sadness is what?
  </li><li>It's self-pity.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>And self-pity really is this attempt
 to make other people feel sad for us.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It's like, I don't wanna feel my sadness.
 So let me tell you a really sad story
 so that you will feel sadness on my behalf
 so I don't have to do the work for me.
  </li><li>Wow.
 Yikes.
  </li><li>And self-pity is the gateway to victimhood.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>All right, so and so victims,
 The story of victimhood is the world is out to get me.
 I'm the common denominator of everybody's other's ill.
 You know, you don't understand how hard my life is being.
 Let me talk to you about it. Right.
 And soon enough, I don't have to take any responsibility for the quality of life.
 I'm living. Right.
 I just get to describe how hard it is and you will either meet me in my
 impaired version by being self-pity or otherwise, like you're just an uncaring person.
 Right. All right.
 So now I'm going to twist what it means to be in relationship with me,
 which is all about like meeting my needs for me while I'm not going to meet any of my own needs.
 Yeah.
 And it's pretty horrible and pretty toxic.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So here's my question.
 So I'm just thinking the whole, I don't know if I went the self pity route, but I definitely went the victim route.
 But in going the victim route, I went the I will survive you.
 Rather, like I'm a victim.
 I'm always a victim.
 I will survive this.
 Right.
 rather than show me self pity.
 I didn't want anybody to show me self pity, but I would imagine that's still an impairment.
 I wonder if just just from the stories you've told me, I wonder if your self pity was all
 internalized, because you were so scared of other people.
 I wonder like to even have self pity means, Hey, hey other human, could you please listen to my sad story?
 Oh, yeah.
 where you were like, you're all dead to me.
 Yeah.
 I am just going to like have my own self pity inside of me.
 Yeah.
 I wonder.
 No, I think that's probably true.
 I do think I felt sorry for myself a lot.
 And then I would just turn that as more fuel into survival.
 And nobody would understand anyway, so I even talked to them.
 That's right.
 And it all happens inside conveniently,
 where nobody can see it and they have no idea.
 Yeah.
 Except where we can see--
 You can feel it.
 It's like those like, you know, old oil drums
 that I've got like toxic waste on them.
 Yeah, they're sealed,
 but you can see the corrosion at the seams.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It's kind of what it feels like.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>See, when we're in South Pity,
 we're trying to express the pain of our heart
 without feeling the pain of our heart.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>That's chip, that's not me.
  </li><li>Yeah, chip, thanks a lot, chip.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Like we're literally trying to say,
 I am sad without ever having to feel I am sad.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So it's like this, you know, blinking an message.
 Like please pick this up.
 So if I'm trying to make you feel the sadness
 that I don't want to feel for myself,
 then I'm actually trying to make you value me more
 than I value me.
  </li><li>Correct, yeah.
  </li><li>Ouch.
  </li><li>Because for you to value you,
 you're going to have to value the things you hold dear,
 but while you just lost them
 and I don't want to feel sadness.
 So could you do that for me?
 Chip says this.
  </li><li>Oh no, not chip again.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Piper down chip.
  </li><li>When we cannot feel sadness, when we cannot value,
 When we cannot ache within over what we lose, we have resigned ourselves to an existence
 that never lets life affect us.
 As a result, we can never find the healing that sadness can bring.
 Does that sound like what you were describing?
 I should have known who we just kept turning the page.
 You'll find an answer.
 Can we read that again for you?
 No.
 Alright, fine.
 feel sadness when we cannot value when we cannot ache within over what we lose. We have resigned
 ourselves to an existence that never lets life affect us. As a result, we can never find
 the healing the sadness can bring. Basically, refusing to feel sad brings about a heart
 of stone. Yeah.
 Right. Stony heart scripture talks about a stony heart and God's desire to actually give
 as a heart of flesh.
 The trouble with a stony heart is it provides immediate relief
 from the pain we're feeling.
 That's the short-term win.
 But the long-term win, the same area where you feel pain,
 sadness, and loss is the same area of your heart
 where you feel embrace and love and connection
 with the father, all of that stuff.
 So what we're learning through this is
 we don't want to shut down our hearts.
 we want to open them up, even though that means us opening up to feeling things we don't historically want to feel.
 Right. But I think if you've experienced a lot of loss and a lot of sadness,
 that statement, like we want to open up our hearts, that can feel overwhelming.
 Oh, terrifying.
 Like just like, am I signing up for just a flood, a flood of hurt?
 But I think also in my experience, the Lord is so good
 to bring things up in the right timing
 with the right support around.
 You know what I mean?
 For me, the process of healing hasn't been an overwhelming one
 even though I was terrified to even go there.
  </li><li>Right.
 I think also just talking about this
 highlights the inadequacy of talking about this.
 So I'm reading this, Age and I are talking about it.
 And there's a big piece missing and it's the process of doing the work.
 Yeah.
 So for me, I just think about like how powerful group therapy is.
 Like you were talking about like, hey, if you're stuck and you've been deeply hurt and
 you're hearing people talk about opening up your heart, that sounds terrifying.
 But there's something beautiful about group work when you are watching somebody else
 who's in the same condition as you and maybe you don't recognize your own condition,
 you can recognize it in them and you watch them either hit up against the limitations
 of the path they've chosen, which speaks directly to your heart, or you watch them be brave
 and courageous, which speaks something to your heart.
 Yeah.
 So, or even one on one counts.
 Oh, absolutely.
 Either one, like I think, I think sometimes things are so big that wisdom is you go get
 help with it.
 You don't try and, you know, do it alone.
 I think my point is if you're listening to this and it sounds overwhelming and scary,
 that's because it is overwhelming and because it is scary.
 Yeah.
 Understand that there's help available to you. I think the danger is when I read this initially there was no
 Practical application for me, so I dismissed it
 And I think I feel sad that people might listen to this and be like yeah
 Sounds like too much hard work and I kind of want to reach to the screen be like no
 It's a lot of work, but it's not too much it produces incredible fruit incredible results on the other side
 Yeah, none of this is new of course King Solomon wrote about this in Ecclesiastes
 Yes, shocked that the wisest man in the world had someone to say about feelings.
 Right. He said this from Ecclesiastes 7, 3, "Sorrow is better than laughter, for by sadness
 of face the heart is made glad."
 What the verse is basically saying is when we actually allow our hearts to feel sad,
 we begin to live life on life's terms, which along with feeling the other feelings allows
 us to feel glad.
 Yeah.
 jumping ahead of ourselves because glad is the last one we're going to be talking about.
 It's the very last one guys I'm so sorry you have to wait several weeks before we get to
 go out. But it's a good one. Yeah it's a good one. So that's the truth about sadness. If we choose
 to feel our feelings feel sad then we'll actually live out of the gift which is acceptance and if
 we choose to squash it down or try and you know put it under a rock or stone over our hearts then
 we tend to live out of that place of self-pity. So if you don't want to become a victim or have
 have a stony heart, practice feeling sad.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>How are you feeling?
 I know we came into this, both feeling sad.
 We've taught a lot about sadness,
 which felt a little weird.
 I mean, this is real time, real time stuff.
  </li><li>I actually feel a lot better.
  </li><li>Talk to me about better, what's better?
  </li><li>I feel some gladness mixed in with my sadness.
  </li><li>Good.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, see, process, find someone to talk to
 and maybe get a dog.
  </li><li>If your lifestyle supports a dog, please.
 Go ahead and get a doc.
