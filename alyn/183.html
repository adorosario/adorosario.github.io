<p> I live in a days but got for Monday.<br/>
 Those wonderful show is keeping up with the jones.
 Welcome to episode one eighty three of keeping up with the Joneses for this week.
 We are talking about keys to a better prayer life.
 You jumped in.<br/>
 I was going to do that.<br/>
 I know I thought I would take over today.
 I took in a breath to speak and you just jumped right in.
 You should edit out the breath.<br/>
 I was about to do our old starting like, "Mr. Jones, how the heck are you?"
 And I just jumped in.<br/>
 You jumped in. I loved it.<br/>
 I knew starting.<br/>
 With the way to lead.<br/>
 Yes, episode 183 of Keeping Up With Jones is we were talking about prayer.
 But before we get to prayer, I wanted to do a weekly catch up.
 Of course.<br/>
 It's really short weekly catch up because nothing really eventful happened.
 I had them mojo's tacos again this week.
 I didn't know about that.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 -Oh, this is confession on air.<br/>
 -Just walk in the light, baby.<br/>
 When did you have Mojo's taco?<br/>
 -Well, I had five $1 bills, so I went and bought a taco.
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong><br/>
 -You didn't tell me about it?<br/>
 -Well, I saw Bill in the factory,<br/>
 and he said I needed to try the new flank steak one.
 -Bill is the owner of Mojo's taco.<br/>
 -Yes.<br/>
 -For people who don't know.<br/>
 -And I felt like that was the word of the Lord for me
 in that moment.<br/>
 So as soon as you went to grief counseling,
 I went and got a taco.<br/>
 So we both dealt with our issues in different ways.
 You buy a healthy method meme by eating a taco.
</p><ul>
  <li>Oh my gosh.
  </li><li>It was so good.
  </li><li>Well, if it's any consolation,
 I had tacos straight after my grief counseling,
 which, you know, went hand in hand.
 So, but I dare say you got the better tacos.
 I just went to Chipotle.
  </li><li>I did.
 I got really good tacos.
  </li><li>Monday and Tuesday, all of our students, God bless them.
 all did their first sermon.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>On our school, we teach our students how to preach,
 and then we get them up to preach.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>They don't really preach,
 it's more teaching than preaching,
 but they all have a topic.
  </li><li>They do a segment of their teaching.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm, and we stand up and they get reviewed
 and give them feedback by all of our staff,
 which has gotta be pretty intimidating.
  </li><li>I would think so.
 I honestly, I feel bad for anybody
 who's doing a father-heart topic with me sitting in the room.
 You know what I mean?
  </li><li>Right.
 you have to teach or prophesy in front of somebody who's been a teacher you've looked up to or a profit that you've known for years and you're like,
 I was thinking about today, it would be like me attending a songwriting workshop and they teach me, okay, this is a write song.
 Okay, you know, here's a chorus, you need a chorus and a bridge and a verse and okay, so next week, come back and sing us your song.
 I would just be like, I thank you for all the building blocks and the ingredients, but wait, what am I expecting to do?
 Well, yes, I mean, it's maybe not exactly the same.
 I think it is.
 But what we think is not the same because we're,
 this is what we do for a living for the last.
 But you can't in a week like learn to play guitar
 or something is my thought.
 But yes, I got you.
 Right.
 It is.
 It's still.
 They did great.
 I think they every year, I am surprised by how well people do.
 And like when I think about how I started preaching,
 which was basically shaking, crying, and vomiting,
 not joking for the first many times that I spoke.
 I'm like, these guys are light years ahead.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And they got up there and they did it.
 And so many of them just knocked it out of the park.
 So it was really good.
  </li><li>Wonderful.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Wednesday we had an all day leadership meeting.
  </li><li>Yes, with good coffee.
  </li><li>Which was tremendous fun.
 I mean, it sounded like it was an arduous task.
 It really wasn't.
 When you're with people you love, time flies.
 Although I noticed that everybody has different levels
 of attention.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's true, that's true.
 I would say I was in the medium range.
  </li><li>Really?
 (laughs)
  </li><li>I'm the music game yourself or stuff, right?
  </li><li>Okay, well here's the thing.
 I made it a couple hours before I got distracted.
  </li><li>Usually I'm distracted.
  </li><li>Yeah, usually I was like.
  </li><li>You had a task, you wanted to get that thing done.
  </li><li>I love tasks.
  </li><li>Yeah, so, and we were being slightly more relational
 slash goofy slash having fun.
  </li><li>Unproductive.
 but I also drank about six coffees
 because they have a beautiful coffee machine
 and now I want it.
  </li><li>And then Thursday was our step-ings in the morning
 and then said grief-canceling and taco-stealing.
 In the afternoon.
  </li><li>Yes, and Zelda playing.
  </li><li>You played Zelda as well.
  </li><li>A little bit, yeah.
  </li><li>Let's bring up 30 minutes.
  </li><li>Now, if you wanna bring up how much we've been playing,
 you need to look at the whole week, you still have me beat.
  </li><li>I've learned to quantify your, just a little bit.
 So let's pull up the switch parental controls, scroll down to Thursday, and AJ managed to
 play for two hours and fifty minutes.
 And how long did you play for?
 That's not more of a position.
 Is it more like four hours?
 No, it was only two hours and thirty-five minutes.
 I played for less than you.
 Okay.
 Let's look at Wednesday.
 AJ played for three hours and ten minutes.
 I only played for an hour and five minutes and positively self-controlled.
 Why don't you look at Friday?
 Friday you played for three hours and 25 minutes and I played for two hours and 40 minutes.
 I think you are skewing the facts, sir.
 I'm just reading the facts. Don't lie.
 It's your cues.
 It's your cues.
 Okay, now you're speaking French.
 Okay.
 I know where you're going with this.
 How are you getting on with Zelda?
 Well, I have killed the four beasts or not killed them, turned them back to being good guys.
 And so now I have all the special things where I can just fly around and stuff.
 It's really fun.
 So my current plan is just to ride horses around in strange landscapes and kill bad guys.
 That's my current plan.
 Well, happy Thursday.
 Thank you.
 And then on Friday, you were continuing your work with Cooper on our video studio.
 Yeah, we mentioned this a little bit last week.
 We're trying something new.
 We started this podcast a long time ago, three years ago, in part because there was lots of
 of people who wanted more connection with us, but we were trying to work out how to do that.
 And that's honestly part of the reason the podcast is so conversational in nature.
 Like right now we're having conversations about Zelda and our week.
 Right. Because the feedback's been that's what people want as well.
 Right. And it's also what you do in real life. You sit down and say, "Hey, you know, how are you
 getting on? What are you doing?" and all that sort of stuff. Here's the thing. I like podcasts.
 I really do. I listen to them when I'm doing the dishes or if I'm on a drive or something like that.
 You listen to them all the time. I do. I like podcasts. Yeah. But should we tell them how you
 listen to them? How do I listen to them? You listen to them at mock speed. You do something on your
 phone where it's like three times a speed. So you have people with nasley voices that now are
 three times a speed. I'm like, stop it. Stop it. Stop it. It's horrible. Okay. I just run a max
 my fine time. So I do listen to things that fasten in real time. And then I use an app.
 How is that relaxing for you? It sounds like chipmunks are yelling at you about tech stuff.
 Typically doing the dishes, so there's nothing relaxing about that process. So I'm just feeding
 myself while I'm doing the dishes. But yeah, so I like podcasts, but I love video. So I listen
 to podcasts like you said all the time, but they really are one-dimensional. So I'm often doing
 something else. And of course, I'm just, I'm listening to these people. I
 realized today, I probably use YouTube more than any other digest medium.
 Yes, mostly to look at Zelda shrines right now.
 No, like more than podcasts, more than TV, more than Netflix, more than Hulu, more than movies.
 I was a YouTube red subscriber, you paid him $10 a month and you get rid of the ads.
 This year we read it our budget and we took that away from him. Please let me have it back.
 YouTube is a terrible experience when there's ads.
 Do you know, they start putting ads in the middle of the video you're watching.
 Why did you say I took it away from you?
 Didn't we decide that together?
 We did powerfully.
 Oh, okay.
 Good.
 I'm now.
 Well, that wasn't that powerful statement.
 I was like, wait, wait.
 Let's just go back a sentence there.
 I'm now asking powerfully.
 I can have my $10 back again.
 Just give me like, I'm filled with.
 It depends how much is Hulu live because we can negotiate.
 I want to watch the Olympics.
 Instead of saving $120 a year, we're now going to spend $240 a year.
 That makes sense, doesn't it?
 What would Dave Ramsey say?
 Oh, I mean, Dave, Dave, Dave, if he knew us, he would love us and probably shake his head
 and say, "I thought you took my course."
 Yes.
 My point is video is amazing.
 It's such a compelling medium.
 And so we're trying that.
 We're trying to produce videos.
 We're working out all the technical kinks.
 We've built a kind of makeshift studio in our house.
 And--
 And I'm ashamed to say I haven't gone down
 and looked at the upgraded version with all the new lights.
 Oh, you're going to be amazed.
 I'm sure I am.
 It's cold down there though.
 It's so cold down there.
 So I haven't been motivated.
 I'm waiting for nicer weather before I go into our basement.
 The point is--
 OK, sorry.
 We're trying to build a better connection with you, our audience, our listeners.
 If you would like to join us on our journey to developing videos, if you head over to patreon.com/allonnaj,
 you can sign up and you can be part of this new thing that we're trying out.
 We don't have a lot of videos to show you, but we do have all of our efforts, our sneak peek.
 You have an opportunity to sign up and support us financially as we're building this.
 and just be part of the crew that help shape and the format of these videos.
 And we'd love your perspective. Again, patreon.com/allen and AJ.
 So moving on from videos, let's talk about our topic for this week.
 Okay.
 We've titled this prayer, but it's really all about getting better at prayer.
 Yes.
 And I was thinking earlier today, I was just, I was praying,
 ironically, and saying, "You know, Father, what do you want us to talk about in the podcast tonight?"
 And I started thinking about prayer and I just started thinking about my prayer life and how my
 prayer life has grown over the years. And I came up with some, some really practical things that I
 noticed that when I started doing my prayers changed and I wanted to talk about that and sharing
 it with you like, Hey, babe, how about we talk about prayer? And you're like, Yeah, that sounds great.
 So this is where we're going to go. I think too, like, I don't know about you because you,
 you grew up in the church. But yes, I did. To me, prayer is a mystery, you know, because I didn't
 get saved till I was 15. And to me, it felt like prayer was this mysterious thing. I didn't realize
 it was just communicating with the Lord. I didn't know it was just having a conversation with God.
 I thought, well, you have to know the lingo really to pray. So if you don't know what a hedge of
 protection is or what traveling mercies are, any of these other things, you know, right,
 then you should just be the quiet one in the prayer circle because, you know, I just,
 I honestly, I didn't know what was happening.
 And so I actually didn't try praying until much later in my walk, because I didn't realize
 I was praying by having a conversation.
 Does that make sense?
 Yeah.
 Here's my four major milestones in developing an amazing prayer life for the Lord.
 Number one.
 Well, the first thing happened after I met the Holy Spirit.
 If you know my story, I got saved when I was seven.
 I met the Holy Spirit in a powerful way in my early 20s.
 The biggest thing that I remember noticing was different.
 After meeting the Holy Spirit was that I started praying out loud.
 Yeah. Prior to that, I was just praying in my head.
 Usually, as I was falling asleep,
 do Jesus, thank you for today, just love you, you're amazing.
 Just pray for widows and orphans in Africa,
 especially those who have no food.
 Food, I'm hungry.
 Now I'd love as a kinder surprise.
 I love kinder surprise.
 How do they get the toys in there?
 And before you know it, you're off on this rabbit trail
 and you don't know how you got there.
 So then you think it's important to follow backwards
 the breadcrumbs to get to where you last left off.
 And you know, that was just happened.
  </li><li>And you pretty much always end up
 thinking about chocolate somehow, right?
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Chocolate or monster munch.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>That's disgusting.
 Monster munch is so gross.
  </li><li>You know what, you will be silent, young lady.
 (laughs)
 Sorry, I'm so sorry.
  </li><li>I would like to apologize.
  </li><li>I am.
 I'm just incredibly sorry for insulting monster munch.
 There's pickled onions, flaming hot, and there's roast beef.
 They're all delicious.
 Oh, I mean, just the name, disgusting.
 So disgusting.
 What's wrong with pickled onion?
 Pickled onion and roast beef.
 Two completely separate flavors.
 Monster munch.
 Do you really?
 Have you ever had them?
 I have.
 You've made me try them a couple times.
 They're disgusting.
 There's something deeply, deeply wrong with you.
 Oh, no, there's something deeply, deeply right.
 Come to my counselor next Thursday.
 I have taste buds.
 Move on.
 Anyway, my point is praying out loud drastically changed my prayer life because I think often
 we confuse our prayer life with our thought life.
 If you don't pray out loud, it becomes hard to work out.
 And you know, you were talking about how prayers are conversation.
 I always thought it was hard to have a conversation with an imaginary friend, which is what praying
 to God was like before I met the Holy Spirit, if I'm honest.
 It was like, "If you're God, I know you're there and I know I should do this."
  </li><li>So this is what I'll do.
 But even to this day, I pray out loud.
 In the car, at home, as I'm getting dressed in the morning,
 I'm most often found talking out loud to God.
  </li><li>Do you know what my favorite prayer has been for me recently?
  </li><li>Good Lord.
  </li><li>When you prayed for Josh and Sarah to have a smooth baby
 instead of a smooth delivery.
 (laughs)
 And Josh said that the nurse is actually commented
 on how smooth the baby was.
 So you know, your prayer came true.
 Well, that's the power of prayer right there.
  </li><li>There you go.
  </li><li>All right, so that's number one, praying out loud.
 If you don't pray out loud,
 I would encourage you to pray out loud.
 It would be amazing.
 One of the major benefits of praying out loud
 is you know when you've stopped.
  </li><li>Yeah, and when you've rabbit trailed, of course,
 'cause you'd actually hear yourself talking about kinder eggs.
 It's actually one of the things,
 I remember hearing Wes Campbell speak on it
 a number of years ago, and he talks about how to pray,
 and that's his number one point as well,
 to pray out loud that the Jewish people are taught to pray out loud for a good reason.
 And it's for all the things that you just mentioned.
 So that's really cool.
 The second thing I learned was the power of praying with other Christians.
 This is not in chronological order, by the way.
 I learned to pray with other Christians.
 I think before I, but I was part of a home group for many years and we'd meet
 every Thursday night and I loved it.
 We would just pick a Bible study and you could just buy these Bible studies
 for small groups, we'd all go through the Bible study.
 Yeah.
 And then at the end, we'd all share prayer requests and then we'd all take time to pray
 for one another, maybe like 10, 15 minutes of prayer.
 And it was amazing because you'd come back the next weekend, people would give an update,
 a praise report and you'd be like, "Oh my gosh, that's amazing."
 And there's something amazing, of course, meeting, you know, we're two or three, we're
 gathering my name.
 There I am in the midst of you, which is amazing.
 Yeah.
 But there's also, you know, when two or three agree on anything, you know, when we pray
 for one another if we agree in prayer. Amazing things happened. So it was a stark difference
 once I started praying with other Christians to see what would happen. And I would encourage
 if you're not praying with others, getting the habit of doing so.
 Yeah, I think too though, if you don't understand that prayer is conversation with God, that
 it's normal words, normal language, that it doesn't have to be some sort of inside
 track, but it's just actually making your petitions or your quest known to God.
 Then praying with others is super intimidating.
 That was what I was most scared of, was being around other people and saying the wrong words
 or whatever because I didn't understand what it was.
 So the freedom in realizing it is conversation, just like I'm having a conversation with you,
 but I'm having a conversation with Jesus and I'm saying, "Hey, Jesus, I need some help
 with this," just like I would talk to you.
 help me a lot because then those prayer circles or little prayer groups became less intimidating
 and more of a joining together than a, "I need to pay attention to every word. Everybody else
 has said so that I don't repeat everything and I need to make sure that I fill in the gaps."
 So that this prayer is really good, you know, like all the pressure that can come with it.
 Wow. Yeah. Number three. Yes. If praying out loud was a big deal,
 yeah. Writing out my prayers was a bigger deal. So good. So I learned from Dr. Marvorkler,
 and we've talked about this somewhere on the podcast, I'll put it in the show notes.
 But we talked about this whole thing about the four keys to hearing God's voice.
 And Mark taught us how to do the single two-way journaling, basically where you write out your
 prayers to the Lord and then you write back what he says. That was a paradigm shifting
 experience for me. I did the math and it's been almost 20 years that I've been writing
 at my prayers and writing down what the Lord says back to me.
 Wow. And you still look like a spring chicken.
 Thanks. I do it. I do it. I don't want to say I've done it daily for 20 years because
 that's not completely true. But I've got 20 years worth of journals of me talking to
 the Lord and the Lord talking back. And it's amazing having this huge big back catalog
 of all my conversations with the Lord. And honestly, the two way journaling thing, it's
 absolutely changed my life. But the quality of the relationship I have with the Lord
 could largely be attributed to the skill of journaling, of learning how to hear the voice of the
 Lord and write out your prayers. Yeah, I would agree. I think it's life changing. It's an amazing
 teaching. Mark calls it "hearing God's voice," doesn't he? But the two-way journaling teaching is
 great. And it just brings your relationship with the Lord to the next level, I think.
 And for that reason, it's the very first thing we teach all of our students on the
 school of the supernatural life.
 Yeah.
 First thing we do is we teach them two way journaling.
 Right.
 First week, we guarantee them, but by the end of the week, you will be able to hear
 the voice of the Lord if you do these four key things and we teach them how to do
 that.
 And oh my gosh, amazing.
 Yeah.
 Cause if you can get people hearing from God every day, life doesn't seem quite so
 scary, does it?
 No.
 It's just like, Oh, you know what?
 I was talking to God this morning and I heard him and I know his heart for me today.
 And so no matter what comes along, you start off the day in a different place because you had a conversation in the morning.
 And you can also see the things that God has said and look back and go, wow, God, you said this and look, it happened.
 So it's really cool.
 And to this day, the bulk of my prayers are written down.
 Yeah.
 Well, we write out everything, don't we?
 The prophetic words, everything is cataloged somewhere.
 Yeah.
 When we get a prophetic word, that's right.
 we transcribe it when we write down. So we've got easy access to it. And more importantly,
 you can search for it. Like this week, our leadership, not retreat, but all day leadership
 meeting, we were combing through all the prophetic words that grace centers been given and just
 being able to have them electronically and search for verses or key phrases.
 Yeah. So powerful. Yeah. The last thing, but I thought of a fifth thing.
 Oh, well, go for number four first because it always comes before number five.
 Well, I want to end with this one. So why don't you talk about praying scripture?
 Because that was incredibly vital in my walk with the Lord.
 Yeah, I, that's actually from the West Campbell teaching that I was talking about earlier.
 He does a whole thing on praying the Bible.
 And, you know, his keys are to set a time and make it sort of non-negotiable.
 You know, so set a time when this is when I pray every day, I, you know, whether you pray, walking or whatever, but you have a time that you pray.
 And then to pray out loud, to pray standing or pacing.
 And his whole thing was when you look at the Jewish believers
 at the whaling wall or whatever, there's movement there,
 there's standing or they're rocking or whatever.
 And that whole, they're taught to pray like that
 because it sort of keeps you away, keeps you from,
 you know, sort of fading away.
 And then his last thing was pray scripture,
 pray the language of God.
 So when you're actually taking out, you take out the word
 and you start to jump off of the word as you're praying through it.
 So you might be praying through like Psalm 23 and you're saying,
 "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.
 Father, I thank you that I will not be in want,
 that I'm not alone, that you are my shepherd,
 that you're taking care of me, that everything is covered."
 And then you keep going, verse by verse,
 and you just keep jumping off of scripture as you go
 and pray scripture back to God,
 but also add your heart in as you're praying.
 And it's awesome.
 It's really, really good.
 I just want to just thought of as we're talking.
 So good.
 The last one, which I'm going to be sneaky.
 I'm going to introduce, but I think we should talk about it next week.
 It's praying in tongues.
 OK.
 This was hard to come by for me.
 Yeah, me too.
 I mean, I grew up in a I grew up in the church.
 I didn't believe that speaking in tongues was for today.
 So that was a rough start.
 I didn't grow up in the church.
 I didn't know what was going on when people spoke in tongues.
 I was like, good heavens, they're having a stroke.
 Something something's going wrong.
 And so my journey into praying in tongues is an interesting one which we'll share next week.
 Yeah, that'd be good.
 Because we both have a story of how we got there.
 Yep.
 And mine is ridiculously left-brained.
 We should do a podcast episode of "Left-braineders' Guide to Speaking Tongues."
 But anyway, the whole praying in tongues thing, that was a major, again, another major development
 in having an effective prayer life.
 One that I've used all the time, almost all the time.
 When I'm stuck, even when I'm not stuck, I love praying in tongues.
 I do it all the time. I love singing in tongues.
 I apologize for the people who sit next to me in church when I sing in tongues.
 Because usually I sing in a falsetto.
 I just, I go for the highest note I can. I don't know why.
 And I just, I go out, it's Jesse Early's fault.
 You know, whenever she sings an octave higher than is naturally possible,
 a trine match with a drastically different results.
 I love it too that our kids love to pray in tongues and they love it when we pray in tongues for them when they go to bed and, you know, so they won't let us leave.
 We can talk about all that next week.
 That's great.
 All right.
 So that's what we're going to do.
 So there's our five things.
 Number one, start praying out loud.
 If you're not already number two, start praying with other Christians.
 Just if you're not in a home group, getting a home group or a life group or an e-group or whatever you call it.
 But there's something so vital about praying with other Christians.
 Make that a regular thing in your life.
 Third thing, learn to two-way journal.
 We'll put a link in the show notes to the episode we did on hearing God's voice and the four keys to that.
 Number four, price scripture, really, really powerful.
 And number five, praying tongues.
 And if you don't pray in tongues, next week we'll teach you our journey into learning how to pray in tongues.
 sounds good. Hey babe. Yes. Do we have any listeners questions? We probably do, but I forgot to look at them in the email. I'm so sorry. It's okay. Actually, if you have questions, you would like us to answer or if there's questions from this episode.
 Head over to <a href="mailto:allen@ag.com">allen@ag.com</a>/ask and send us a question. I promise I will look in the email and pull them out for next week and we can do some of those questions. So send some questions that you would like us to answer.
