<p> I live in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the chances.
 Hello.<br/>
 No singing on this podcast.<br/>
 Can you hear me?<br/>
 I can.<br/>
 He beep.<br/>
 As usual, it's late nights on the night chat,
 and my wife is delirious with joy.<br/>
 I'm not in California dreaming.<br/>
 No, you're not.
</p><ul>
  <li>Looking at the handsomest man on the planet,
 Happy Valentine's Day.
  </li><li>Oh, it's Valentine's Day, baby.
 We should have done a Valentine's scene podcast.
  </li><li>We should have done the dating game.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>How would that work with me and you?
  </li><li>I don't know, we'd need somebody to ask the questions.
  </li><li>Okay, maybe next year we'll time
 and do a proper Valentine's podcast.
  </li><li>That would be excellent.
  </li><li>Let's catch up on this week.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>The highlight of my week was listening
 to our students preach back to us.
  </li><li>Oh, it was so good.
  </li><li>It was a great joy watching them.
  </li><li>It was.
 fun to see them do something that two weeks ago they were like, I can't do this, I can't
 do this, and they all got up there and did it.
 Oh, so proud of you guys.
 Yeah.
 Then on Wednesday the snowpocalypse came back.
 Yes.
 Shut down.
 All of Franklin.
 Yes.
 Our kids have used too many snow days that apparently they're going to have to eat into
 summer vacation.
 What?
 Well, they're only budgeted a certain number of snow days and we've already gone over
 them.
 Are you sure?
 Well, I don't know.
 I did hear that from a third grader who got off the bus or maybe...
 I think my knowledge come from higher up the food, Jane.
 Then that might not be a mess of ours.
 I mean, I think they've had four snow days total.
 I'm not sure that should have eaten into their entire thing.
 All right.
 Well, you know, yeah.
 I'll tease him at the bus stop on Thursday.
 Maybe he'll have come a little bit.
 I'll push him into the dirt.
 I got great feedback this week from our listeners
 about us describing our fight that we had about who would get out of bed first.
 Nothing's really changed this week.
 That is unfair. It's true, though.
 I'll take it back if you like. Let's move on. The big news was our friends Gary and Sarah came
 into town. It is the big news, which coincidentally is the focus of this episode. It is. And here's
 the thing listeners, if you are into accents, joining my southern slash Scottish accent and AJ's
 utterly fake Canadian accent is fake. I can say out in your boat.
 There you go. But joining our accents this week, we have a Kiwi and we have a Welshman,
 Gary and Sarah Morgan. Welcome to Keeping Up With The Joneses. So good to be here.
 Finally. I know, if I'm honest, when we started this podcast in mind was you guys on the show.
 And I've been racking my brain how to do it remotely. And without forcing you to spend a
 a couple hundred dollars. Just to make my dreams come true. I just thought I'd wait until you're
 actually here. Come on. So it's a genuine joy for us to have you on the show. Tell our listeners
 who you are, where you live and what you do. Well, I'm Gary and I'm Sarah and we live in Melbourne.
 And I'm from Wales and I'm from New Zealand and we passed through an amazing church called
 Hillview. Are people in Melbourne confused by your accents? No. Yes.
 So do they pick out that you're a Kiwi? Is it that obvious?
 Very rarely. And like I say, the number six, because to them, it sounds like a bad word.
 Like sex?
 Yes, that's the word. That's not a bad word. Oh, but it is when you're trying to give change.
 Yeah, it is.
 Or ask my wife to count and have to five. I say, thank you.
 But obviously your accent completely stands out.
 No, because the interesting thing is people ask me where I'm from.
 So yes, it does confuse them. Yeah, but I say let them guess and they're like Scotland,
 Ireland, Belgium, South Africa. Never Wales. Never Wales. And when I say Wales, they said,
 oh, that's just England. And I'm like, Australia's part of New Zealand.
 Yeah, they must love that. Yeah. Completely. AJ, remind us how we all met.
 Well, I first met Gary. We went to do this conference in Croydon. And when they asked me to come,
 They said they have this young prophetic guy coming.
 And so could I come and talk about inner healing and the father's heart and he would
 prophesy and talk about prophetic things.
 And that was all I knew.
 And so when I arrived at the conference, Gary and I both looked at each other like we were
 scanning one another.
 And I guess we decided instantly that we were all right with each other because we
 walked up the street to grab a coffee.
 Exactly.
 And I remember you coming home from that conference.
 Yeah.
 who weren't married yet? No, very good. You said, you've got to meet this young man,
 Gary Morgan, you're going to absolutely love him. And I just thought, no, I'd already
 decided that I wasn't going to like Gary Morgan just for purely stubborn reasons. But
 then we, how did we meet you? You invited us over? Yes. So it may. So I, at that point,
 was running a prophetic school in Cardiff. And I invited you guys to come, you'd be
 married. And so I said, why don't you come and speak at the school?
 And that's when we first met.
 That's when we first met.
 I remember walking in and you scanning me to.
 Exactly.
 You scan everybody you meet.
 Oh, scan it.
 When I just sort of up and down like a.
 That's called scanning.
 Do you remember that I just pestered you?
 Like, I think I was so happy to find a profit that could answer all my
 questions that I remember every everywhere we went.
 I sat beside you and I just asked you every question, swapped all prophetic experiences
 that I'd had said, what about this? What about that? What does this color mean? What about
 this? How do you pick up this? Do you remember that? Yeah, it was awesome. It didn't drive
 you nuts. No, it's all. So you're the opposite of Bob Jones. When I tried that with Bob Jones,
 he shot me denied. Bob does not like questions. No, I wonder if he still does. He might be
 okay with him now. And then how did we meet Sarah, baby? Well, remember Gary met Sarah
 And he told us the story about how she jumped into his heart.
 And we must have heard that story about 10 times.
 Oh, 100 times.
 Oh, no, I mean, like in the first two hours of him being at our house.
 And then to the point where we could retell it.
 Yeah.
 Cause you fell in love instantly.
 Sarah Morgan, you were, you guys were ministering at the same conference together.
 And you didn't know that she was behind you.
 Is that right?
 That's right.
 We were at the sound desk setting up some music and you tapped on the shoulder.
 He turned round and you're socially verbose.
 I mean, you're happy to talk to anyone.
 Yeah. And as soon as you turn around, all you could say is, do you like music?
 It was more like, uh, uh, do you like music?
 And she just jumped into your heart.
 Totally jumped into my heart.
 And is it fair to say you knew you were going to marry her at that point?
 Yeah, totally.
 That's not awkward at all.
 And your dad was there.
 Wasn't Sarah.
 My dad came that night.
 But when I met Gary, I seriously thought he was an interesting person who I did not like.
 Define interesting.
 Well, he completely after he said, "Do you like music?"
 He completely ignored me.
 Oh, of course.
 Classic middle school boy likes girl, doesn't know how to interact with girl.
 I'll just shut down and ignore.
 Hopefully she'll get the message by our smokeses.
 Exactly.
 Yes.
 And so my dad arrived at night, actually at 5am in the morning,
 because his plane got delayed.
 And so the next day after my session, I was very tired.
 And so Dad and I decided to go for coffee.
 And somehow I do not know to this day
 how I found out Gary liked Starbucks.
 But we went to go to Starbucks with my dad.
 And it was just me and my dad.
 I was supposed to be a father daughter date
 and Gary nicely kindly invited himself.
  </li><li>How'd it boy?
 How'd you do?
  </li><li>He had a plan.
 He had and profusely flirted with me for the next two days.
 I actually was talking to Sarah about the fact of,
 I think at that point, you guys had gifted me
 my own domain name, GaryMorgon.org.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And so I was talking.
  </li><li>That sounds like a gift I would give.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Which I don't think is even available anymore.
 But at that point, I said, well, Sarah, you're in ministry.
 So maybe you need to pray and ask the Lord
 for the surname of your future husband,
 and then you can just get the domain name
 as a sort of a--
  </li><li>Prophetic statement?
  </li><li>Prophetic statement.
 smooth, so I thought it was amazing word. And what did you think?
 I thought he was crazy, because number one, I was like, where is that coming from? But
 my dad actually interjected me even my flow of thought. And he's like, we don't need
 to be talking about marriage. And he actually,
 No, no, we don't need to be talking about stuff like that.
 Yeah. And he jumped right in between us. And then that was the end of the conversation.
 Shut it down.
 Shut it down. The thing that got my father was Gary actually showed him the farting preacher.
 And so your dad loved that.
 My dad thought it was hysterical and that's what went him over.
 He said, "What gave you my daughter because you showed me the farting preacher."
 Exactly.
 Pretty much.
 And how quickly did you guys get married after meeting?
 Seven months later, Gary flew out to New Zealand.
 And so we'd only seen each other for three days during that conference.
 Seven months later, he flew out to New Zealand.
 And so that was the 10th of January.
 To propose.
 post 22nd of January, which is seven months to the day that we first met because we met
 on the 22nd of June.
 Those are 22s.
 We'll talk about 22s in a second.
 So on the 22nd of January, you fly just with the intent of proposing.
 Exactly.
 And then because I remember getting a phone call to be your best man.
 Correct.
 Agent I were in London and you guys were in Wellington.
 And I remember you phoned me and said, Oh, I just proposed to Sarah.
 You know, we're thinking of getting married here.
 Could you guys book some flights to come out to Australia?
 you be my best man. I was like, Oh, dude, that was amazing. And then about crying if
 I'm wrong about 50 minutes later, you called me back and said, actually, I'll change your
 plans. We're going to get married in 10 days. Correct. Yep. And your parents were completely
 happy with this. Well, it's actually my dad's idea. But my dad thought she was up the
 What does that mean?
 Because you're pregnant.
 It's a person.
 It's a person.
 Yes.
 Okay.
 Up the Duff is a colloquium for knocked up.
 Yeah.
 Which is a colloquium for a button in the oven.
 That's correct.
 Okay.
 Your dad thought you'd go her pregnant.
 That was a shotgun wedding.
 Exactly.
 Okay.
 Which it was not.
 No.
 No.
 So then you guys got married and we all had a life that was very similar.
 We lived in airports and on airplanes.
  </li><li>Very much so.
  </li><li>And so thus began four years of us
 intersecting in airports around the world.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And you had your own itinerary,
 we had our own itinerary,
 and we just decided whenever we were in the same country,
 we'd always meet for lunch or breakfast or dinner somewhere.
 I made a list of the place we ate.
 We in Toronto, do you remember where?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Seeing town.
  </li><li>It was?
 Seeing town.
  </li><li>Oh, good job.
  </li><li>We met in Sydney, do you remember where?
  </li><li>The airport.
  </li><li>It was, the airport, which terminal?
 would be two and a one. Very good. We met in Montreal at the at the Westin.
 You your memory. Wow. Do you remember the movie we all went to see?
 Did we go see a movie? No, we didn't see. We saw a shooter with Mark Wahlberg.
 That's what you're right. We did.
 See, I remember. We met in Cardiff. We met in London. And then obviously we met in Melbourne.
 Yes. So we've known each other for we were just working this out 11 years.
 We've stayed in each other's houses. We have a ton of shared life experience. Good, bad, sad,
 mad, lots of mad, and tons of joy.
 And for us, Ray J and I,
 like you guys are two of our favorite people
 in the whole world.
 And even though we live on opposite sides of the world,
 we talk often thanks to the joys of FaceTime.
 I mean, there's so much stuff we could talk about.
 There really is, but I wanted to play a game
 that we always like to play when we have guests come on,
 and it's called First Things First.
 So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna read you out
 a bunch of things, and I want you to tell us
 first thing that pops into your head. Alright, so first thing that pops in your head when
 we say David Wagner, Moocey, Prophet, Graham Cook, Brilliant, amazing, Sean Bolz, Inspirational,
 Beard, Very good, Chris McLaurney, Legend, Phenomenal, Chris Valleton, Funny,
 Shirts, Danny Silt, Slick, Keeping a Love On, I'll let you have that even though that's
 keep your love on even though that's for Tyler. Oh, look at you, Bill Johnson, genius,
 revelatory parenting interesting awesome baby wise life changing salvation
 Ferrari first Gary apple mecca fruit Tobias my world cuts gift sushi velvet wild ginger happy
 god chances oh hey there there's so many things that we could pick your brain about which is kind of
 of why I want to have you just here and locked in this room and we could do a podcast for months
 on end. Because really, there's so much we could talk about. We could talk about life as pastors
 leading a church. We could talk about the prophetic. We could talk about travel. We could talk about
 the crazy signs and wonders that you guys have seen, but have never spoken about publicly.
 We could talk about the miraculous nature that seems to follow. You could talk about the birth of
 Tobias. I mean, there's literally so much stuff we could talk about. We could talk about wisdom.
 I mean, there's so many things we could talk about. But what I want to talk about is,
 I want to talk about this morning at Grace Center. Because I thought that would be a fun thing
 to unpack and pick your brain. Because one of the joys that Aj and I have of being your friends and
 getting to see the behind the scenes of your life is you have one thing in common with a lot of the
 the people that we love and are very close to our hearts in that you are the same people
 off stage as you are on stage. And that's unfortunately rare than I would like it to be.
 So we get to see the behind the scenes, we get to see before the service, we get to see
 after the service, we get to see how you treat each other, how you treat your kids and all
 that sort of stuff. But if you weren't at Grayson this morning, look in our show notes, go to
 allenaj.com/90 and look for the link that talks about Grayson or Sunday morning. And
 It's 45 minutes, but it's 45 minutes that will astonish you.
 You call out about 12 people, either by their name
 or by their date of birth or by their anniversary
 or by their street address.
 Supernaturally, like you're a visitor to our church.
 I'm sure you've been here a couple of times,
 but you live in Australia.
 And supernaturally, you were praying
 and I've got in front of me your notes.
 And I wanted to talk about this process.
 So stop what you're doing right now, go watch the 45 minute episode and then come back and
 we're going to pick up and talk about that.
 Welcome back.
 I hope you enjoyed that.
 Okay.
 So I'm looking at your sheet of paper here.
 Now, talk to me about the sheet of paper because somebody actually wrote in and asked,
 Shannon wrote an ask and said, I have a question for you.
 When you're getting prophetic words, do you write down or know every seemingly random thing
 that passes through your mind?
 And then if so, how do you know what to throw away and what to keep?
 Well, I can kind of answer that for you
 'cause I can see your notes right here.
 You have written on a line the word Emily,
 the number 2710, and then the question,
 your husband's a hunter, question mark.
 How did you get that?
  </li><li>So I'm in worship and I'll just get sometimes a flash
 or a thought or maybe something will remind me.
 And so that particular one is I had the name Emily
 and I saw 2710.
 And so for me either that's a pin number or it's a date.
 And so I went with the date and I just saw a gun
 and particularly a person hitting the,
 hitting a bullseye.
 And so.
  </li><li>So out of that you wrote down Emily,
 2710 your husband's a hunter.
 Is he a hunter?
  </li><li>So then you stand up and you say,
 you just literally read out, you go,
 hey guys, let's see,
 Let's not try and make this fit if it fits.
 Is there an Emily here and does 2710 mean anything to you?
 Could be a pin number.
 If it's a birthday, because of course you're British,
 it would be the 27th of October, which would confuse Americans
 because we do dates and months the other way around.
 And lo and behold, there's an Emily.
 We happen to know her.
 She's a student on the school.
 You've never met her in your life before.
 Emily stands up and you said, what is 2710 mean?
 And she said, my birthday is the 27th of October.
 And then you said, "Is your husband a hunter?"
 And the whole room laughs because we know that her husband's name is a hunter.
 So there's a whole play on words.
 Now, at this point, the room is in total awe, but you haven't actually proficied over them
 yet.
 All you've got is supernatural revelation about their name and their birthday.
 And they're, as fair to say, they're absolutely stunned.
 to me about your journey into that because all of us at this table have spent years training
 people how to prophesy, we've prophesied all around the world. And yet that seems to be
 a another level to get people's names and dates of birth. Tell us how that happened.
 So back in New Zealand, I was in Hamilton and we were ministering and it sort of came
 to the place of God reminding me of what happened in Toronto in 2005, when the first
 number I ever got was was Sarah's, where she was staying.
 Wait, now let's let's talk about that.
 I'm so sorry.
 Tell me that story.
 So, um, so Sarah, I was in Canada, Toronto in Toronto and John Arnott's office, and I
 get a message to tell me Sarah had been rushed to hospital, she'd fallen off a horse.
 And I couldn't get back into the US because my visa had expired.
 I'm sitting there and all that came before me was this 10 digit number.
 Wait, wait, wait.
 So when you say came before you, what does that mean?
 So I literally saw it like almost like a ticker tape in front of me.
 With your eyes open with my eyes open.
 You see a 10 digit number scroll past you.
 School past my...
 So you write it down?
 down and John Arnott being the child like instigator.
 Instigator years, he said, "Well, Carrie, there's a phone, call it."
 And so I picked up the number and started calling it and it started ringing.
 And at that point, my heart's pounding in my chest and this woman answers.
 And the only thing I can say is, is Sarah there?
 And I hear like a fumbling of the phone and I thought the person had put it down.
 And as I went to put the phone down, the next voice I heard was Sarah's and she had just
 come in from the hospital literally 30 seconds before I'd called out.
 Hang on.
 If that's not the most bonkers thing you've ever heard, I don't know what it is.
 So the odds just statistically, sorry, my left brain this morning, I was keeping tab
 of the number of people you called out and just I it's been years since I've done statistical
 analysis.
 that when I was studying math in university.
 But the odds of getting a 10 digit number
 that is somebody's full number,
 somewhere in the world are really, really high.
 You can get any 10 digit number,
 it's probably a full number.
 But of getting the actual person
 that you were thinking about is astonishing.
 So are you freaking out or?
  </li><li>I'm totally freaking out.
 And so I find myself in New Zealand
 and I get this number and I just go for it
 and the guy, it's a guy's pin number.
 And at that point, I totally retreat into myself
 because I realized I couldn't trust myself
 with that level of revelation.
 And at that point, I'm like, I can't do this.
 And it wasn't until some years later
 that we find ourselves in a place
 where the Lord said to me,
 "Gary, I trust you, you can trust me."
 And at that point, that's when I started flying.
 I think it was 2010, back at Grace Centre.
 That's right, it was back here at Grace Centre.
  </li><li>Who's Ashley?
  </li><li>Yeah, who's Ashley?
 And that's when it started back in my life of cutting,
 of jumping back into,
 and then the Lord gave me their address.
 And that's when it just started flowing,
 but I really was hesitant in moving in that
 because I didn't trust myself.
  </li><li>Okay, can we push a pin there and go back to
 years and years and years and years ago?
 This is the story,
 tell me if I'm right, if I'm telling it right,
 of how you got into prophetic ministry.
 You're at a conference in Rehues' ministry.
 You're not a minister, you're just somebody in the conference.
 And Rehues calls you out,
 and you're not in prophetic ministry at all,
 you're not even in ministry, you're what, 16 years old?
  </li><li>I'm 19.
  </li><li>Oh, you're 19 years old.
 And Rehues calls you out
 and gives you the most random word ever
 when the bells toll the prophetic will be released.
  </li><li>You'll move from the gift of prophecy
 to the office of a prophet.
  </li><li>And you're thinking, what the heck does that mean?
 No clue.
 he starts describing to me how I see literally what's going on in my spirit and it freaked me out.
 So one year later, you're back at a conference, but this time you're speaking at the conference.
 And as you're speaking, the bells of the church next to you start ringing, start tolling.
 As they start ringing, it's like a switch happens, and something gets turned on,
 and now you can see the secrets of people's hearts.
 And that freaks you out too.
 Yes.
 So you've had this journey, and this is one of the things we love about you.
 Actually, one of the things we love about you both is that your wisdom gift is as large as your revelation gift,
 which is uncommon.
 Because most prophetic people start out as what John Paul Jackson used to say is gifted
 nothings.
 Their gift validates their existence.
 But you guys somehow got a foundation, the Father's love, that has studied your prophetic.
 So, Emily, so you have your word of knowledge, you've got the names of people, you've got a day of birth.
 But what's interesting is you don't know whether it's a day of birth or a pin number.
 Or an anniversary.
 All you've got is revelation and faith you give it.
 That's what I love about it.
 I'm looking at a page here that's all faith.
 It's all a diving board.
 You got no confidence that it's going to be right.
 And I start, I start at the beginning of the service.
 Like sometimes I'll get stuff like last night we talked about, I said, you know, I'm getting the name.
 Barbie and another name, Melody.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Yeah, and so, you know, sometimes I'll get just randoms.
 And I know it's the Lord because it's the way I feel
 when I hear it.
 It's like I feel the kindness of God
 when I think about these things.
 And so, you know, there's all manner of thoughts
 going through my head, but it's literally
 when I get a name or a date,
 it's like I can feel the kindness of God.
 So that's why at the beginning of the service, I have my iPad out.
 I usually have a book, I forgot my book this time, but I have my iPad out so everyone can see.
 That's why then I walked up to you this morning and showed you what I had because
 one of the things that I believe is key in the prophetic is integrity.
 It's prophetic ministry, you're training somebody, and they say, "I have a word from the Lord."
 And you say, okay, what's the word from the Lord?
 And they say the word from the Lord is 911 root off the red
 nose reindeer.
 And you say you're adorable.
 That's not a word from God.
 That's not in the Bible.
 And yet tell me about 911 root off the red nose radio.
 So I see 911.
 So I'm thinking emergency, which is 911 here, but also as well,
 911 in the sense of a day of birth, which, you know,
 know, is could be the ninth of 11th of September 11th of September, all then, you know, the
 9th of November, depending how you look at it. But for me, it was 9/11 came quite strong
 and and Rudolph the Red knows reindeer. And so I saw a birthday card with Rudolph on the
 front. And so I thought I'd write it down.
 So then you stand up in front of a packed congregation and you say, Hey guys, I've got
 word. It's a weird one to be sure. But I hear the Lord say 911, rude,
 authorized, nose reindeer. And it just goes silent. And you're feeling about as excited
 as a foreigner spacesuit. Right. All the oxygen has been removed from the room. Everyone's
 standing there. And what are you feeling? Are you feeling panicked?
 No, I just, I just know God's kindness and in the lens he goes to to reach people.
 So even though nobody's responded, and then after a couple of minutes, people do respond,
 but it doesn't feel right. It feels like people are massaging it to fit.
 And so you're so confident that the Holy Spirit has spoken to you. It doesn't even pop in your
 head that, "Oh, well, you know, win some, lose some." For me, it's like that resonance of when
 someone responds, it's interesting. There's been a couple of times when people have responded
 and it doesn't resonate. It doesn't feel like there's an agreement there. And so that's why I
 I really, um,
 harbored to really find, you know,
 it's really like hide and seek.
 It's like connecting the dots.
 And so, you know, for me this morning, it's, it's finding that end.
 And we know now afterwards.
 Well, that's not good afterwards.
 Okay.
 Let's hold on there.
 So what you do is you say, oh, well, there's nobody in the room that that word
 applies to it.
 Are we streaming?
 Yeah.
 And we are.
 So you just prophesied to the, the video camera or the recording.
  </li><li>All the recording.
  </li><li>There's been so many times when there's a word,
 and this is one of the things I encourage people,
 even if you get something and it doesn't connect
 in the room, if it's been recorded,
 then it's gonna connect with someone.
 That word is too specific, not for it to land.
  </li><li>I hate to be a stickler,
 but 911 Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, while specific.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>It could just also be pizza.
  </li><li>It could just be pizza.
  </li><li>Do you know what I mean?
 And yet your confidence in the Lord is that you know he's not playing games.
 That's right.
 So you go ahead, you just give this word and lo and behold, one of our students
 writes this.
 Well, well, before you say that, you're, while you started prophesying, you got
 about a sentence in and then you said, it's a K, it's a K Rudolph.
 And we all went, Oh, Kristen Rudolph.
 Oh, that's right.
 You said your first name began to the K.
 You said it's a woman.
 And then you said it's a K.
 It's a, you know, and we all went, Kristen Rudolph and you kept going.
 Okay, go ahead.
 So then, Kristen Rudolph, whose name does begin with the K, wrote this on your Facebook wall.
 She said, "Gary, I wanted to let you know that I was who you prophesied over at the end of the
 second service at Grey Centre this morning. I was at first service this morning, which is why I wasn't
 there when you called out 911 and Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer. My birthday is 911 or September 11th,
 and I work for a company that sells life-saving emergency medical equipment, AEDs and defibrillators.
 So there's your there's also the play on words of 911 and when I tell people my last name, which is Rudolph
 I often say Rudolph like the reindeer. Thank you for the word. It completely resonated was right on and was so needed
 Thank you for your obedience for sharing his words and for loving so well
 I remember Steve Thompson from Morningstar
 I have prophetic conference somebody had complained that prophetic people are you know often insecure and he said well
 you would be insecure too, if your job was to stand up in front of hundreds of people,
 tell them stuff that you've got no way of knowing if it's right, and you're telling them stuff that
 no ordinary person should actually know. But you seem completely calm in doing that.
 Yeah, like for me, he's trusted me with something and it's my, you know, the word responsibility is
 also the ability to respond. And so, you know, if he's given me the responsibility of this word,
 it's my ability to respond to that. And so in that then it's, I realize I'm partnering with him.
 And so he's given me something to do it and to the best of my ability to the filter of kindness
 and to that place of his goodness, that's all I can respond with.
 Yeah, I think that's amazing. Sarah, what is that look like off stage?
 Like in your normal everyday life, how does the prophetic manifest in your marriage? What's the string about it?
 It's very frustrating because you cannot surprise a prophet.
 He did it to me again. Actually, I'm at the point now. It wouldn't be a Christmas without him having a dream about what I'm to get him for Christmas.
 So this started quite a while ago. But I remember when we were living in America, when Gary had been telling me how he was missing all his British food.
 and i actually had found a british import store so i went out borders all of his favorite food
 wrapped it up and put it in his stocking and he wakes up it's probably about two weeks before
 christmas he wakes up in the morning he said i had the worst dream ever and i'm like what was
 your dream honey thinking it was a nightmare and he said on christmas day i opened my stocking and
 it was all my british food and so i was like you kidding me and so i went to the closet got it
 is ducking out and I threw it at him.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Well, that sounds like the right response.
 You know, yes, absolutely.
  </li><li>I was trying to do nice, something nice.
 And there's only one time I would have ever surprised him.
 And that was for his 30th birthday.
 And I had about 50 people I'm not kidding praying
 that he would not find out about his surprises.
  </li><li>You know, it sometimes helps if you wrap your head
 in tin foil.
  </li><li>It does.
  </li><li>From the moment that you buy the gift,
 just sleep with tin foil, walk around with tin foil
 around your head, he shouldn't get any revelation at all.
  </li><li>But I'm welcome.
 I'm pretty sure.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I know Alan's been at the mercy of Gary's prophetic
 with catrix.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm just thinking,
 one of my hobbies over the years has been catrix.
 I lived with a couple of magicians when I was in university
 and I love the skill of close hand magic
 and by no means proficient, I'm a bumbling amateur
 but there's a bunch of catrix.
 I've loved to develop over the years and in seasons of my life I find myself practicing them.
 And I remember when you were staying with us one time, I'd been brushing up on these tricks.
 And there's this trick. You know, often when you do a trick, especially for adults that don't
 like to be fooled, they often say, "Oh, I know how you did that." And here's the thing, even if you
 know how you do one part of the trick, there's no way you know, especially with the caliber of
 tricks I was doing, the ones that you would have seen on television, David Blaine would have done
 them. And even though I know how they're done, they're incredibly complex, require a huge
 amounts of practice. And in one particular occasion, I'm showing you this trick. And
 part of the pattern that goes with the trick is you get the person you're doing the car
 trick in into your side, you get them off kilter by kind of deceiving them a little
 bit by the parameters says, "Hey, let me teach you this trick." And you do it and it's all
 misdirection. And it's an astonishing trick. I saw that the reason I wanted to learn it
 is I saw David Blaine do it on TV. It's a magnificent effect. And so I did it on you
 and you're like, "Oh, that's awesome. So tell me how you do it." And I was like, "No, no,
 I'm a magician never reveals the tricks." And you were like, "Yeah, but you started a trick by
 saying, let me teach you how to do this trick." I was like, "Oh, Gary, that's part of the pattern."
 And so then you went to bed, and as you went to bed, you just... Yeah, I was like, this isn't
 injustice. Alan's word was, "He would teach me." And so I went to sleep and in a dream, the Lord showed
 me how you did the trick. And then you woke up that morning and you were like, "And I came through."
 And you were like, "I know how you did that trick." And of course, I'm thinking,
 There's no way. There's literally no way. And even if you did know one, I mean, there's so many
 components to that trick. And so you said, give me the pack and you
 talked me through every step of the trick. And of course, you couldn't, you couldn't
 do the trick because it required huge levels of dexterity in your hands, but you could absolutely
 go through step by step, the mechanics, the slights, the misdirection. And I was like,
 like, you know, you're giving me.
 I kind of feel sorry for your kids as they get older and hit teenageness.
 It's all good.
 It was not only him because he'll go out for McDonald's and I say, hey, what do you have for lunch?
 He's like silent treatment.
 I'm like, you had McDonald's to me.
 All right, tell us, I've got some listeners questions, but before I do that, tell us a story of one of the most random, I think 911
 Rudal Thorett and those Rangers got to be up there in terms of random.
 But tell us another random word of knowledge that you've had that seems to be the Lord.
 I was in Brisbane recently last year at Church called Worship Centre and again had this
 left field sort of play on words and the word was, "While shepherds washed their socks by night,"
 which is something as kids we would change that to that, you know, that sort of "While
 I'll share with you what they're flux by night.
 We would change.
 And so I just get it and I'm like,
 hey, that doesn't, that's random,
 but I'll go with it because again,
 I felt the kindness of God.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And then I also got, I think the 19th of January.
 And so I just said it.
 And all of a sudden this woman fall rose back,
 so it gets up and slowly makes her way forward.
 Now I realize that she has actually broken her ankle
 and she has a plastic cast on her right or left leg.
 And on it is a sock and on the sock is a sheep.
 But the crazy thing is,
 is her surname is Shepherd
 and her wedding anniversary is the 19th of January.
 And so at that point, I know the Lord wants to speak.
 And a lot of times I'll get the word of knowledge
 without the word and it isn't until the person stands up
 or I connect with the person that then,
 I tune to flow as we teach students,
 I tune to flow and then what the Lord wants to say to them.
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause it's important to note
 that it isn't just a parlor trick
 of getting people's names or dates of birth or pin numbers.
 That's just to identify the person
 and really root the person
 that what you're gonna say next is the Lord.
 And then you give them a prophetic word
 about the Lord's heart for that person, their nature
 or a word of encouragement,
 or perhaps what's coming down the line
 to prepare them for this next season.
  </li><li>And I'll be vulnerable.
 As many times people will say to you,
 "Oh, you got that off the internet,
 "or you got that on Facebook."
 And I remember being at a church
 when at the end of the service,
 this guy comes out of nowhere
 and he comes running my face and said,
 "You got that on Facebook."
 And the pastor--
  </li><li>Wait, wait, wait.
 So the accusation is that before you go to a church service,
 you're scouring Facebook in the hopes that these people show up
 and you've gleaned personal information about them to use in the service.
 Okay.
 And so that's the accusation.
 So the pastor stops him and says, one minute, sir, turns and calls a guy that I administered
 over in the service and said, can you tell this guy or Gary ministered to you?
 And he said, well, he got my anniversary.
 He got my wife's name and he got my birthday.
 And he said, really?
 He said, are you on social media?
 He said, "I can't be.
 I work for the AFP, which is the Australian federal police."
 So he has no social media presence.
 The equivalent of America's FBI.
 Exactly.
 And so this guy, which was so hard warming, totally humbled himself at that point and
 profusely.
 You know, apologized.
 But what amazes me is, let me make this statement, even if the information, even if I had a
 piece of information.
 It's what the Lord connects after that and the word that connects into that person's
 life, that you can't even fabricate.
 You couldn't even orchestrate that like 9-1-1, she works for an emergency company.
 And so right before the foundation of the earth, the Lord orchestrated all this for
 her, for her word of destiny to be released, which just blows me away.
 You also got our senior pastors address, which now the whole internet knows, but you got
 his street name, the intersection of that street with the main road and the house number
 and his favorite song.
 But I think what's important for people to know is that people on the outside looking
 that now think that you know everything.
 But the truth is you've got these clues and you don't know what they mean.
 And it's the majesty of God that he weaves them together.
 One of the things I love about you guys is that you don't just demonstrate the prophetic,
 you love to impart the prophetic.
 Sarah, talk to us about the school of prophets that you guys have got.
 Rowan, tell us about how that happened, what it looks like, and how people can get involved.
 Oh, it's very exciting.
 We're starting on the 16th of March this year, how that happened.
 We've had a word about doing a school quite a number of years ago, and we did do a school,
 we really felt like that wasn't it. And so we actually shut that down and just last year,
 the Lord released three P's. The Gary spoke on it actually this morning. So check out
 the show notes and watch this morning. But it was three P's was prayer, praise and the
 prophetic and the Lord was just showing us how to respond to that prophetic word. And
 And one of these was training people in the prophetic and to do what we do, we want to
 raise up people that have integrity, have the love of the Father and can show Jesus
 wherever they go.
 And so we really just want to release what we've been taught over the years.
 And so that was the heart behind the prophetic school.
 And I'm totally not flattering.
 I don't know anybody better equipped to teach healthy prophetic protocol than you guys.
 Like you guys live it model it. It's not about the gift. It's about character
 It's the thing the hallmark of true prophetic ministries the kindness of God
 So when I watch you guys minister, I always weep
 Because the kindness of God is moving I'd see the same thing happening in David Wagner's life and in John Paul
 Jack's life and many others, you know, it's it's the hallmark of the Kingdom of God is God's kindness
 So is this a school that only people in Melbourne can attend?
 absolutely not because we got so many people around the world that know us and want the
 training and we actually felt the Lord really strongly about going online. So we have, I
 think we only have five spaces available left. We're only doing 25 students online, but
 you can find out how to apply for that on hillview.org.au and then you can forward slash
 school of prophets. Please apply by tomorrow, which is the 15th of February.
 Which is my birthday.
 Which is when this podcast goes live. So they basically, if you've just heard that and something
 lit in your heart, go online now and apply. Exactly.
 Yeah, but we will give you grace.
 If you were going to be planning on attending a prophetic school, you already knew this was
 coming. Exactly, because you're so prophetic.
 You probably already got to fill it in. So people who are, don't know if
 who Melbourne can attend the classes online and still get the notes, can still get the
 exercises, will still get feedback to help.
 They will also get one-on-one mentoring with one of our staff, if not either myself or
 Gary.
 So we're doing small groups online via Skype or FaceTime as part of the school.
 If you have got the time and the availability, I think you'd be nuts to not do that.
 So it's really simple. It's just one session. Well, it's actually two sessions a week, but
 in one night. So it's just Thursday nights, Melbourne time. And but for the online students,
 it's on demand. So they'll just be required to watch it before the previous week or before
 their one on one session.
 Wow. That sounds amazing. So we had some list of questions we already asked you. Shannon's
 question. Elle wrote in and she said, she's actually got a couple of questions. Well,
 you've kind of answered that. Her first question is, how do you know what you heard was from
 God you talked about the resonance.
 Yes, it's the resonance really of its agreement.
 You know, it says his spirit agrees with our spirit, the with the children of God.
 And you know, it's the same.
 It brings it where that brings identity.
 The resonance brings an identifying of, you know, it's the Lord.
 Gary, you mentioned this this morning and but I'll ask this question.
 I always hear about you guys getting a free house.
 How did that happen?
 You touched on that a little bit in the message this morning, Sarah.
 Give us the, I'm probably asking the wrong person out of the male or the female, I'm asking the female for the short version of how you got your house.
 But actually you're asking the right person.
 All right, how did you guys end up getting given a house?
 Well, we'd done some prophetic ministry with a business couple.
 And I think it was about three or four months later, we happened to be back there and we went out for dinner.
 And they just presented it to us.
 And there's a whole story behind how we thought God was going to get.
 we were actually giving God a different house.
 And they gave it to us.
 We had it for a whole year.
 And it was just the most amazing gift.
  </li><li>So they gave you a house plus all the utilities.
  </li><li>They did indeed.
  </li><li>And then you had to live in America,
 which was a huge deal because your whole married life,
 you'd lived on Samsonite Avenue.
  </li><li>That's what you said.
  </li><li>Correct.
  </li><li>Out of suitcases.
  </li><li>Out of suitcases.
  </li><li>So now you had a base in the United States.
  </li><li>Yes.
 And it was an amazing privilege.
 and that set you up to then move eventually to Melbourne.
 It did indeed.
 All right, last question we've got is, how would you recommend handling prophetic delay,
 like where someone tells you something that takes forever? I know that happened to you, Sarah,
 it's just really, really hard. And that's the truth. You get a prophetic word,
 all of us want that prophetic word to happen now, or at least an hour from now.
 And then when it doesn't happen next week or next month or even a couple of years,
 how do you handle your heart with timing and prophetic words?
 I think allowing yourself to be disappointed and to cry helps a lot because you're allowed to
 process those feelings with the Lord, not just isolated from the Lord and having a couple of people
 that you can turn to when you really are just struggling. So for the only person that I really
 did turn to was AJ during that season for me. But I think the one thing that really helped me in
 the season when I actually got to the end of myself of believing for Tobias was actually just taking
 my eyes off the words and looking at God's faithfulness because at the end of the day,
 he's faithful no matter what happens. And it even says in scripture about Sarah,
 she judged the Lord faithful and then got pregnant. And oftentimes we find the faithfulness of God
 after the fact of him providing something. And I actually had to come to the place in my heart
 that he was faithful no matter what happened. And I actually got a revelation of God's faithfulness
 before the fact of the deliverance of the promise.
 Always look at God's nature, not God's narrative.
 So you asked to have that was alliteration and some sort of rhyming. It's amazing how your brain
 works, Gary.
 The one line is,
 Gary, do you realize I just had this revelation that this podcast right now was actually started
 first fruits years ago when you and I started a podcast.
 That's right.
 Do you know I found that podcast?
 Are you not going to play?
 I thought about that a few days ago.
 I was like, wow, that was the seed.
 So it's so noisy.
 I'm going to dig out that and listen to it.
 And it's not absolutely appalling.
 It is.
 I've been going to put it online and people can listen to the banter that we had years ago.
 I'm pretty sure AJ and I did it as the geek squad.
 Yeah, it was.
 It was something like that.
 But I remember like us talking and saying this is just, I mean, it's cute.
 but it's a colossal waste of time and this sort of thing I'll never catch on.
 We're ahead of our time. That's right. That's right. All right. Tell us something that happened
 while we're recording this that people might not know that happened. So while we were recording,
 I get this name flash called Heather and everything just stopped working.
 Yeah, it's totally random. We were just recording and then everything cut out.
 And as I'm trying to work out, like, why did everything just cut out? That's so bizarre.
 We didn't do anything, no, we touched anything.
 And you were like, that's so weird.
 When everything cut out, I got this name.
 And so, yeah, I'm just going to go with what I saw.
 And so I saw the name Heather and the 10th of November.
 And I feel like the Lord wants to encourage you that you're coming into a place
 where the stress is moving to the bless.
 And I feel like you've been in a stressful time with what you do.
 And I feel like you're a justice person.
 I feel like you work in social justice or something to do with social stuff.
 and I feel like the very stress of your work is moving to the very blessed of your work.
 And I feel like where you felt you've been striving, the Lord says you're going to start thriving.
 And Heather, I know reminds me of Scotland.
 And so I just want to, yeah, just want to bless you that God is going to take you on to the hills
 of blessing, not into the valleys of despair.
 And so I want to bless you with that in Jesus' name.
 All right, let's land this puppy.
