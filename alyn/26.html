 I'm Sam.<br/>
 Is that not racist?<br/>
 I don't think so.<br/>
 Okay, good.<br/>
 Let's just stop there.<br/>
 How are you feeling?<br/>
 I feel a little bit iffy.<br/>
 Would you like to tell a listener what's in your left hand?
 Yes.<br/>
 I have a hot tardy.<br/>
 Which is basically hot water and copious mince of alcohol.
 It's not copious amounts of alcohol.<br/>
 I have two tablespoons of brandy in it.
</p><ul>
  <li>Well, brandy's like a soft liquor.
  </li><li>I don't know what it is.
 I don't know enough of it at all.
 (laughs)
 But I have that and honey and lemon and hot water in a cup.
  </li><li>And I have new and wing of bat.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>Why do you have a hot toddy?
  </li><li>Because I'm feeling a little iffy
 and some nice southern ladies this morning
 told me that I should have a hot toddy.
 So I'm going to try it.
 Okay.
 Medical research breakthrough happening here live.
 If A.J.
 begins to slaughter her speech, it's because of the medicine she is on.
 We've had, I was just thinking about this week.
 We've been so super social this week.
 We had dinner with our dear friend and fabulous missionary, Shelly.
 We did.
 She's back in town from Cambodia at the moment.
 We caught up with Josh and Sarah.
 We did.
 We took Sarah out for her birthday.
 I'm here two months late.
 Yeah.
 I mean, you know, no big deal.
 I'm caught up with Mason Lamly.
 We had great habachi.
 I love habachi.
 So do I.
 Food prepared for you was a show.
 Yes.
 And our guy was funny.
 He was great.
 He was probably one of the best habachi people I've seen.
 Mm-hmm.
 And then we had yum yum sauce, which is a lord.
 I mean, do you need to say any more yum yum.
 But it's been a rough week aside from meeting lots of people, which was a great one.
 was a good part. Yes. All our kids were sick at varying stages of this week, which meant
 you had to stay home Monday and Tuesday because I was teaching on boundaries at the school.
 Yes. Then you got sick Monday night. So I thought I emanate for you. Yes. And then
 poor sweet mug and Scott's sick either Tuesday or Wednesday night was up most of the night,
 which meant I was up most of the night. I was in my friend. No, you were not. Yeah,
 I got up at 513. You lay on my sleep. You did. When I didn't get him back into bed until
 five when he started crying and getting five thirties like babe.
 I just finally got to sleep.
 So you graciously came down with it on the weekend.
 So I didn't get to go to church strong, but I did stream it and it was great.
 Yeah.
 I'd definition everything.
 And then we just streaming.
 Then we had Jared and Jenna's wedding tonight.
 We did.
 Which was awesome.
 We had lots of amazing people.
 We did.
 Which was so funny.
 Yeah, we got to see Tyler and Anna Lee.
 Yeah, his beard looks amazing.
 They're a big fan of the beard.
 They're probably in the running for one of Nashville's most beautiful couples.
 They're stinking gorgeous.
 They are ridiculously gorgeous.
 Inside and out.
 And we picked up Steve Long from the airport.
 We did.
 We did.
 We did.
 Which is nice to see Steve and catch up with him tonight.
 Yeah.
 You're always going well.
 Bit of home.
 Told amazing stories.
 Yes.
 And he's the chain of school this week.
 Which is so great.
 And if you're listening to this on a Monday before 7/13, you live in Nashville.
 Steve will be ministering at Emmonate.
 Yes, and it sounds like what he's going to speak on is very interesting. I'm I can't wait for tomorrow night
 Would you like some listeners questions? I would do you want to answer question one or question two?
 I will like I don't know. Oh, you can do number one and I'll do number two just for fun. All right reading the question number one
 Question number one is I can't really see
 There we go
 It says
 It's from Rachel Suzanne and it says I've been thinking about humility a lot. What is humility?
 I know Jesus is a good example, but if you could break humility down into bite-sized chunks, what does it look like?
 I think
 humility is simply agreeing
 with what God said about you and
 There's a thin line between true humility and pride
 For example, David is sent off by his father to go take some sandwiches to his brothers.
 And when he arrives at the front line, he finds out about Goliath.
 And so he's just inquiring like, "Hey, why are the army of the Lord cowering when this
 Philistine comes out?"
 And he's just genuinely asking, like he's just so confident in God.
 He's like, "Why are you guys chicken?"
 They misinterpret what he's saying as him being cocky and arrogant, but he's not.
 He's just in touch with what God has revealed himself to be.
 He's just walking with his revelation of the Father, especially because we know that
 he's the Lord has saved David from the lion and the bear many times.
 So he's just like, "Hey, guys, why don't you do this?"
 And they misinterpret his confidence in God or his humility for pride.
 Yeah, and I think a lot of people think humility is actually what we would call false humility,
 that sort of self-depreciating, "Oh, you know, I'm a worm," or "I'm whatever," and
 it's actually not a right understanding of how God sees you either.
 So yeah, I think humility is simply believing with what God said about you and walking in
 accordance with that, and sometimes you'll be confused as not being humble.
 But a key probably to walking in humility, Proverbs 27, verse 2 says, "Let someone else
 praise you and not your own mouth and outside or not your own lips. So I think
 the mark of humility is the focus doesn't have to be on you, you're happy for the
 focus to be elsewhere. But you can also handle other people praising you and
 you're not quick to swap that down which is that false humility thing. Oh no, I'm not.
 The funniest verse I think in the scripture is where it says, "Now Moses was
 the most humble man on the face of the earth.
 And the person who most likely wrote that was Moses.
  </li><li>Yeah, it is really funny.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>All right, you ready for question number two?
  </li><li>I think so.
  </li><li>Question number two from Justin.
 He says, "Hey Alan, AJ, you go for a couple of your podcasts."
 Thank you.
 I'm called to step in a full-time ministry,
 but it seems like it has been difficult in regards
 to the area of provision and finance.
 My question is, how does God provide for the calling He gives us?
 Can you give me any insight from your own journey in pursuing full-time industry?
 Wow.
 I guess it's really, for me I'd say you want to make sure you have God's timing on it,
 not just his calling to do it, because the timing is pretty important as well.
 When I got called into ministry, even though it looked really bad financially when it actually
 happened, there was provision for me. So for myself, because I knew I was supposed to in
 the fall step into full time ministry. This was a 2001. And, but I had a full time job
 and a free car and a free it just looked like a bad decision. But I knew what God was speaking.
 And then when it actually happened, the way that it happened, which I didn't realize,
 I got laid off and I got, it was either 10 or 12 weeks worth of severance.
 And so I actually had several months worth of buffer in terms of finances to be able
 to step out.
 And the Lord really provided I never went without.
 I definitely had some tricky bits and some months where it was scary, but never where
 I didn't, I couldn't meet my bills, although I do remember once not being able to buy groceries.
 So you decided to fast?
 I did.
 That was very logical.
 I'm going to fast and I'm not going to tell anybody that I can't buy groceries.
 And actually I learned a really valuable lesson in the midst of that is that you're part of
 a family no matter what you're called to, whether you're called to ministry or whether
 you're called to work at a bank, you're part of a larger group of people.
 Those people that loved me at the time, one of my friends came over, Jenny, and she came
 over and she said, "Hey, what are you doing?"
 And I was like, "Oh, you know."
 And she just really wanted to get in my house.
 She had a key, but she wanted to get in my house, kept past me and look at my fridge.
 And I only had a catch-up bottle and lemon left in my fridge.
 I mean, I'd eaten anything you could eat.
 And she said, "Why don't you have groceries?"
 And I said, "I can't afford it right now."
 And so I'm just fasting.
 And she went out and got food and came back.
 And she said, "Part of being a family as we get to
 share each other's burdens and we get to love each other,
 you know, enough to help."
 And that kind of stuff.
 So there was moments where I learned great lessons
 at the low points.
 But I think I would also say what God orders He pays for.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So I think that I had probably the low points
 And there wasn't that many of them in order to learn something either about God or about
 myself, or maybe not in order to, but I did learn something about God or about myself
 in the midst of those things.
 Well, I also think, Justin, in your question, you say, "I'm called to step into full-time
 ministry."
 There's a big difference between being called and being commissioned, and you never want
 to get those two confused.
 So you know, Jeremiah was called as a prophet from before he was conceived in his mother's
 womb, I said.
 And most scholars think that he was probably approached by the Lord somewhere between 8 and 12,
 but then didn't start as prophetic ministry for a long time.
 You know, Jesus obviously was the safer the world.
 You know, he was called out before the foundations of the earth.
 And yet when he was born in the natural, he didn't start as ministry until he was in his 30s.
 And so if he tried to start his ministry before he was 30, he would have been premature.
 And he would be like, "Hey God, why are you providing for my ministry?"
 And the Lord's like, "Well, you decided to start your ministry without waiting for me to start it."
 And that's why I'm by the timing thing.
 I totally agree.
 It's about commissioning.
 Yeah, some of it is all timing.
 So don't get ahead in your schedule.
 And it's also about like, if you feel called to full-time ministry,
 what are you doing now to sew in that direction?
 Like, start doing the things that you can do now to serve people that are in full-time ministry
 into serving small groups and serving the places that maybe don't look as flashy and
 wonderful as you might think, but are actually places where you get to start to practice
 your gifts.
 Very good.
 All right, our topic for this week is love.
 Nice, small topic, easily defined.
 Should be able to get through it in 10 minutes, no problem.
 No problem.
 Go for it.
 Go for it.
 Well, I thought it'd be fun because we just came from a wedding to talk about, I guess,
 just some of the pieces of advice that we sometimes give at weddings and stuff like
 that, like things that we've learned that have been helpful.
 I'd love to do that.
 Before we do that, I wonder if you could talk to us about Storgay love because that's a
 foundation for all other loves.
 Yes.
 And when we talked about, you know, what we're going to talk about in our podcast, we started
 talking about love.
 I thought about my mother.
 So can you give a quick one minute teaching or explanation rather on Storgay Love and
 our Tupperware?
 Storgay Love, okay.
 Yeah, Storgay Love is, well, Storgay is one of the four words that the Greeks use to describe
 love.
 So when we read the word love in the Bible, what we translate as love, they had four different
 words for that.
 So they had Storgae, Folayo, Eros, and Agape.
 And Storgae was a family love or affectionate love.
 It's a kind of love that you feel and you experience.
 And typically, as a child, it's your first form of love that you come in contact with.
 You primarily receive Storgae love from your mom and from your parents, but first from
 your mom in the womb and with her rubbing her stomach and then when you're outside of
 the womb from your mom and your parents and your siblings and that kind of stuff.
 Storgay love is experience not understood.
 So there's three main ways that you receive Storgay love that's through loving eye contact,
 loving tones of voice and loving touch.
 like tickles and cuddles and all that kind of stuff.
 You see that when a newborn baby gets rolled in a public place and people run around the
 baby like, "Oh my gosh, you're so gorgeous, you're so cute."
 And people instinctively reach for face, hands and feet.
 Right.
 And they make eye contact and you start gibbering in some other language like you have no command
 of the English language.
 And that's story of love and action.
 Right.
 Babies, they suck it out of us adults.
 Right.
 story he loves, our mothers doing that in our close family.
 That gives us, you call it Tupperware, but basically a container in which to store love.
 Yeah, that's Denise Jordan describes it as it's what places within us a container that
 enables us to receive and contain love.
 So that later on in life when people are pouring out affectionate on us or pouring in love
 to us or we're now getting married and that kind of stuff, we're able to receive and
 contain that, it just doesn't just flow out through our feet like a bottomless pit.
 You know, it's that container is there.
 So I want to boast on my mother with that as your...
 You should boast on your mother.
 Yeah.
 She's awesome.
 She is the Storgate Queen.
 Yeah.
 So I didn't know what Storgate was till I heard you teach on it.
 And when you taught on it, I thought, "Oh, gosh, suddenly my life makes sense."
 Because for those of you who know my mother, you know my mother is to motherhood, like,
 Bill Gates is to Microsoft or Steve Jobs is to Apple.
 Neither of those are good examples because Steve Jobs is now dead and Bill Gates no longer runs Microsoft.
 But anyway, there were the founders there.
 No, he doesn't.
 Nevertheless, my mother is amazing.
 And all I remember my childhood being was my mother covering us in affection at love, just kisses, cuddles.
 Constantly tell us we were amazing.
 Always eye contact, always loving tone of voice, just amazing.
 And my, you know, my friends who would come over to my house would be on the receiving end of my mother's
 storgi love. And so I was just thinking about the capacity to receive and send love comes
 from a full Tupperware container. Yeah. And we've probably all met those people that are difficult
 to love, not because of difficult people, but when you show them affection, when you show them
 love, it's like a sieve and then just go straight through them. Right. And probably because they
 were never actually shown it properly as children. I think probably at the end of this podcast,
 we should pray for people who are worried that their Tupperware is faulty. But anyway,
 I just wanted to kind of honor my mom who's just an absolute storgi monster, which is probably
 where I learned to receive such enormous love and which the father, of course my dad, you know,
 was loving too. But when I talk about the father, him, talk about the heavenly father,
 who would just lavish his supernatural love and it would feel very similar to that storgay
 container. You know where you just get filled and overflowing. So anyway, yeah, I love love.
 Do you know, I find that when I'm alone with the Lord, my heart begins to overflow with love
 for other people. Like I'm not a gushy, gushy person who sits and thinks about people. That's
 terrible. I really don't, you know, I just got on with life. But whenever I come into the Lord's
 presence, I begin to, and often when I'm falling asleep, I begin to think about people and my
 heart begins to overwhelm with love. You know, you'll notice that that often I'll go to bed,
 then I'll get out of bed. And it's usually because I'm connecting with the love of God,
 and I want to go and be with him. But a lot of times it's me thinking about people who I love,
 Are people who love me well and my heart is being still overflow with love.
 Not weird.
 It's beautiful.
 But it is beautiful, but weird.
 Especially when I'm trying to sleep.
 All right.
 You mentioned practical stats for love.
 You were going to do a whole lot of advice we gave for people who were getting married.
 I was thinking of stuff like, you know, when Jeff Dollar said he who apologizes first wins.
 That's sheer genius.
 Right.
 So just like little, little tips like that.
 Like I was thinking today, you know, during the wedding, I was thinking selfishness is the enemy of love.
 You can't be selfish and be loving towards somebody at the same time.
 That's very true.
 What about you, baby?
 I am all out of quick, wicked, brilliant, one-liners, but love.
 I find that hard to believe.
 Give me a second.
 Okay.
 That's too much pressure.
 Oh, I don't know.
 I was thinking this was going to be a back and forth thing, not the AJ show.
 But, um, I guess I would say like stuff that we've said or stuff that we've
 passed on to people or things like, you know, learn what the other person's
 love language is and learn to speak it, which actually you're very good at, at, uh,
 say that again, but louder, actually you're very good.
 That's right.
 Um, I would say you are much better at speaking stuff like acts of service to me than I am
 at speaking words of affirmation to you.
 Or I'm still very clunky at it.
 I have to think to myself, he needs to be affirmed.
 You did a great job, baby.
 But even like, even though I think that in my head, I think saying something like, thanks, babe.
 This is awesome where as a words of affirmation person,
 you need actually each thing recognized to feel affirmed for it.
 Right.
 But I wonder if that's actually a words of affirmation thing or if it's a man thing.
 Because it seems like from some of the conversations I've heard recently of
 different teachings, it's a man thing more than a words of affirmation.
 Well, I think about when I'm doing like this morning, I
 at home the kids from church and you're a church and I'm thinking what would bless you?
 So, then I'm systematically compiling in my head a list of things that would bless you
 and then I'm working through them.
 And somewhere in my head I'm thinking if you don't notice what I've done I'm going to
 feel disappointed because it's all been intentional.
 It hasn't just been a by-product.
 Like you being blessed isn't the accidental by-product of me doing stuff.
 The only reason I'm doing this is so that you're blessed.
 But if you're doing it so I'm blessed, then shouldn't you just be happy that I'm blessed
 and shouldn't be about whether I recognize every single thing?
 That's what I don't understand.
 Right.
 I think probably somewhere in my head I'm thinking I'm being intentional.
 I'm being intentional to come out of my comfort zone and do stuff to show you that I love
 you.
 Therefore, you will be so profuse in your overwhelming of that love that a natural overflow will be to tell me how awesome I am.
 So did I do okay telling you how awesome you were because I remember coming home and being like, "Babe is so clean and so great."
 And then I came upstairs and he'd done the beds and I was like, "Babe is great."
 But I don't remember you throwing me on the bed and jumping me.
 Oh.
 That's the ultimate.
 That's not words of affirmation.
 That's something else of affirmation.
 my primary love lineages are physical time and quality touch.
 That was stolen from the genius, Josh Parsons.
  </li><li>That is hysterical.
 Babe, what was the thing that,
 I think it was Chip Judd said about,
 essentially it was like make your life
 about serving the other person.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, Chip Judd, he's a genius.
 What did he say?
 He said marriage is a competition to see
 who can out serve one another.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I love that definition.
 Such a great idea.
 I like the line that you say that we stay in love because we're married, we don't stay
 married because we're in love.
 Yeah.
 That's from YWAM.
 I mean, that's something I learned on YWAM.
 And I didn't really understand it because I wasn't married.
 Right, but now...
 It totally makes sense.
 When...
 I love what Danny Silk says about, you know, you modify your behavior to preserve the
 connection.
 Yeah.
 So we have a connection because we're married.
 Yes.
 connection will vary in degrees of connectedness throughout the week depending on stress,
 commitment, time, misunderstanding, great communication. It will go up and it will go down.
 The temptation is when it goes down is to believe the worst about your spouse
 and the temptation is to just disconnect and go get your own love needs met somewhere else.
 which isn't of course healthy. At that point, the greatest act of love you can do is step out and serve the other person.
 You know, modify your behavior. Right. When you least feel like it, basically. Right.
 And that's what I think, marriage about, you know, I, we said this a lot. Marriage is about death.
 It is. Marriage is about dying to yourself really, really quickly so you can invest in someone else.
 As fast as you can. Right. And I love Jeff's line. You know, he apologizes his first wins.
 You mentioned that earlier, but the whole thing is I rather than demand that my rights are met,
 I actually ensure that my responsibilities are being administered. So my rights,
 and kind of misquoted scripture here is that I have a wife who submits to me.
 But my responsibility is to love you as Christ loved the church. Too often in marriages,
 I'll just complain. I mean, the husband will just complain more. My wife isn't submitting to me.
 You're like, yeah, you don't get to demand your rights. You just get to honor your responsibilities.
 And vice versa, you could be demanding that your husband loves you Christ, loves the church,
 but actually you, you know, submitting to him and you honoring him. So that's been an interesting
 challenge. Yeah. And now I think it's too, too,
  </li><li>Turkey for anyone really.
  </li><li>I think love also comes down to being responsible.
  </li><li>Making a choice every single day.
  </li><li>Right, it's the age old thing.
 You said to me the day,
 I think we were having a family day out
 and it's like, I don't wanna have a family day out.
 And you were like, suck it up.
 We decided to have three children.
 So we actually, I get it that you don't wanna be a dad today,
 but newsflash, you are a dad, whether you want to be one or not.
 So why not make a choice to be a good one?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so sometimes love is just as practical
 putting your big boy pants on and being present in the room.
 Yeah.
 Often it's just as practical as that.
 I think the idea that the warm fuzzy love is what keeps you through 50 years of marriage
 is probably fairly naive.
 I think it's the love that you choose.
 It's not fairly naive.
 It's absolutely absurd.
 But I think that like I still feel that warm fuzzy love towards you, but there's so much
 more depth than what I love.
 There will be days during the week where you do not feel that warm fuzzy love.
 Like yesterday, you're managing three sick kids.
 God bless them.
 They can work out.
 I'm outside doing a task that is way beyond my competence level.
 I've been working all day in the freezing cold, trying to build that
 screen in porch and I'm feeling like my saw is laughing at me.
 That the screwdriver that will not work is mocking me.
 I'm just, you know, and so as a result, my frustrations are being
 expressed towards you who haven't done anything wrong.
 Yeah.
 And I can tell very quickly, oh, wait, I'm diminishing our connection.
 And yet you don't choose to lash out.
 You are just like, stay in the zone.
 Stay in the zone.
 He's frustrated.
 He's probably as frustrated as I am.
 And that's maturity, but you're not feeling warm fuzzy.
 You're just having to remind yourself.
 And he loves me.
 He's just having a bad day.
 And I'm choosing to love.
 I'm choosing to stay connected.
 But I also know that you're not doing something that you enjoy and, you know,
 I can, I can see where that could create some tension for you.
 Right.
 But what I'm saying is I'm honoring your ability to stay connected,
 even though I'm disconnecting because I'm frustrated.
 It's got nothing to do with you.
 You're just, you're just happened to be in the zone where I'm frustrated and I
 happen to be aiming at you, which isn't very nice or very, or, or, or honoring.
 But here's the great thing you can later apologize and just say, Hey, I'm so
 Sorry.
 You are amazing at that game, but
 you are amazing at you.
 You came back in after you've been outside for like what half an hour or
 an hour or something.
 Oh, it was probably five minutes.
 I'm so good.
 Remember?
 Okay.
 Sure.
 Five minutes.
 Let's go with that.
 Sure.
 And you just came over and gave me a hug and said, I'm sorry, babe, you know,
 whatever.
 And that was, I mean, that's it.
 We're good.
 I'm restored.
 I'm fine.
 You know, but I would also say
 that you have a fairly robust piece of Tupperware.
 Yes. And I'm not particularly emotive.
 No, you're not.
 Though I have my moment.
 Yes, you do.
 So I don't know if any of this advice helps anyone other than to just say, we're all in
 process, I think.
 What do you do if you want to love someone?
 But there isn't someone in your life that you can love.
 I'm talking about you want to be married and you're not married.
 How did you cope in the eight years before I arrived on the scene and answered your prayers?
 I think I tried to do well at the relationships that I did have as opposed to focus on the
 ones that I didn't.
 Well, that's very profound.
 So I did have a bunch of girlfriends that were, you know, very sweet and definitely gifts
 to me and then a couple different couples that were the same, you know, just wonderful gifts
 to me.
 So I tried to focus on, okay, God, you know, during this season, this is who's in my life
 and you know what my desires are.
 So I'm going to enjoy the people that are in my life right now.
 Then I would also just try and sew towards where I wanted to go.
 So if there was, you know, people or marriages that I could bless in some way, I did that
 as well.
 Why don't you pray for people?
 Okay, so for those people that are listening, why don't you go ahead and put your hand on your stomach somewhere?
 I always sort of imagine that container somewhere around you where your stomach would be.
 And I'm just going to pray for you. Father, I thank you for each person listening today.
 And Lord, I ask that you would supernaturally either go in and repair the container
 that is there that can receive and contain love, or that you would just supernaturally replace the whole thing with an upgrade.
 Lord, I ask that you would just fill in any holes or...
 that you would increase the capacity for each person for their ability to receive love from you,
 and not only receive it, but be able to contain it.
 It doesn't flow out through their feet five minutes or two hours later, but they still
 know that they're left and they're able to walk in that.
 And also when others in their lives are trying to love on them and pour love into them that
 they would be able to receive that and not enter into skepticism or cynicism or anything
 like that.
 Lord, I thank you that you are amazing and no matter what we've been through as children
 or adolescence, no, you know, no matter what we've suffered or what loss there's been,
 you can heal everything and anything because you're amazing and you're big and you know
 everything that's happened and nothing is beyond you.
 So God, I ask that you would really just pour out your healing on each person listening
 today.
 And Lord, that you would help us from this day forward be able to receive from you in
 new way and receive from those people that you've placed in our lives in a new way in Jesus name.
 Amen. Thank you to everyone who bought a copy of our band
 I hope it's going to be a blessing to you this week and we will be here at the same time
 next week.
 Have an amazing week.
 Bye bye.
