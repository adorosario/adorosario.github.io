<p> I live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 I'm good.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 I'm all dressed up and nowhere to go.<br/>
 Well, we had somewhere to go.<br/>
 And then we came home to record a podcast.
 Well, I actually came home to snuggle my babies.
 Yeah, we were our friend, Matt and Tiffany's wedding.
 And it was stunning.<br/>
 It was beautiful.
</p><ul>
  <li>It was really beautiful and the food was fantastic.
  </li><li>I tell you what, if you were single to that wedding
 and don't go away with a date tonight,
 I can't help you because there was a lot
 of really good looking single people.
  </li><li>There was.
  </li><li>And seriously.
  </li><li>Yes, but I think actually much more single females
 than men, so you know, it's tricky.
  </li><li>I, yeah, I didn't do a head count.
 I just thought we live among beautiful people.
  </li><li>We really do, it's true.
  </li><li>Anyway, we got some.
  </li><li>I wanted to dance.
 You did want to dance.
 I desperately wanted to dance.
 You wanted to win a Houston the thing.
 There was all like the fun,
 dancey people were at this wedding.
 Right. Yeah.
 Did any of those fun,
 dancey people have children that hadn't seen them for the whole weekend.
 No.
 And that's why you had to leave.
 Yeah.
 Which is sad because I want to say.
 They had a dance floor.
 I was ready to do some pop and lock.
 Where'd the wires go again?
 Did you know, have we talked about the fact that I used to be a break dancer?
 You were not a break dancer.
 Okay, this is a true story.
 I have not do my normal.
 I used to work for the MI6.
 Okay.
 I actually used to be a break dancer.
 I'll try and believe you.
 Right.
 When I was 10 between the ages of 10 and 12.
 Sorry.
 You can, next time I, when my father's here, you ask him,
 was I a break down to it?
 Do you want to know what my street name was?
 Oh no.
 Yeah, I really want to know.
 It was Voltaire.
 Ah!
 What?
 What is your problem?
 wait did you make it up yourself and it's not going to you know it i i didn't make it up i copied it from the name of the the marker brand like sharpies it was called fault here and i thought that's so cool because it's like vault like electric.
 And i had my own hair like what you do with muscles i have a great chance i had my own linoleum.
 Oh, I had a whole be boy outfit.
 You had your own linoleum.
 Yep.
 That would roll up and I put out in the garage and I'm going to need pictures.
 I think I speak for everyone when I say we're going to need pictures.
 The only pictures I think that I've got is of me and my Nike winbreaker with my Nike headband and my Nike wristbands.
 Wow.
 Yeah, it's true.
 So you were very fashionable break into then.
 I feel like I'm being mocked.
 Maybe.
 Was this when you had dreadlocks or was that late?
 That was like a later fashion decision.
 That was much later.
 OK. Anyway, we are so off track.
 We were wedding.
 We came home to see we met our kids to put our children to bed and record a podcast.
 Where were you this weekend?
 I was calling all of the house.
 We couldn't find.
 I know.
 I was hiding.
 I was in the master closet.
 I feel like literally I did all the work that we did.
 You did because I did all the other work.
 So I was away doing a father heart conference in Chica, mugga, Georgia.
 Chickamauga would be a great street name for a breakdown, sir.
 Break it down, Chickamauga.
 Did you have to beatbox while you were break dancing or how was your father
 heart? We can. It was really good. I, I fell in love with that church.
 They're so great. Yeah. They're lovely. They're really lovely.
 Yeah. It was really funny because I guess quite a few of them actually listen to
 the podcast. So shout out, whoop, whoop, Chickamauga. But yeah, I met a bunch of people that I was
 like, well, you know what, if I lived in Chattanooga or Chickamauga, I'd go here. It was a great
 church.
 If you're not from Tennessee, Chattanooga and Chickamauga are places that are actually named
 those places. I thought people were joking when I first got here and they said they were
 from Chattanooga.
 You're like, yeah, like somebody named a city that, oh, they did. Okay.
 Sorry about that. While you were away, I was daddy on Kid Patrol.
 Euler. The secret to one of the parents being away for the weekend is to just get your children
 hyped up on activities. So I picked them up from school on Friday, took them straight
 to the opticians to get their glasses.
 So exciting activities.
 Well, they were excited. They couldn't wait. MJ's bummed because he's got perfect
 I want glasses. And so having to rock in a new spectacle. Then we went straight to Chick-fil-A.
 Then we went straight to the movies. Then we went straight to Walmart to do some shopping.
 So Friday night was taken care of. They didn't even ask for you. That was my goal.
 Mummy who? And then Saturday they had two kids birthday parties, so that took care of that.
 And then I introduced my mother-in-law, your mother to sushi, which was highly amusing.
 It was.
 I told her that it was impolite in Japanese culture to take bites of sushi, so you had
 to shove the whole roll in your mouth.
 That's kind of true, but anyway, yes.
 Well, she did it much to my delight, and I have a video of it.
 Oh, okay.
 Can I see that later then?
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 We're going to love that.
 Okay.
 So anyway, that was our week.
 And you were also break dancers in the past life.
 Well, I also wanted to add that I got an amazing welcome basket in the hotel.
 And I saw that on Instagram.
 Yeah.
 Did you bring any of it home for me to eat?
 Um, it wasn't your basket.
 It's my basket.
 I know, but we're one in spirit.
 So it was very fun looking at it because I was like, Hmm, somehow they know everything
 I like and it's in this basket.
 Then there was this box of chocolates and I wasn't going to open the box of chocolate.
 I was going to wait until later.
 But then I thought if they ask me if I like the chocolates they got, I wouldn't be able
 to answer.
 So I opened the box of chocolates and what do you know?
 It was actually shoes.
 Well, they really small shoes are really large chocolates.
 They're folded shoes.
 Like they're folded up.
 They're called teaks and they're super comfortable.
 They're like ballet slippers.
 They made out of how do you fold up shoes?
 Are they got hinges?
  </li><li>I'll show you.
 They're, no.
 They're just like a flexible soul.
  </li><li>I'm excited for you getting shoes.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But I'm kind of misled.
 I thought there was chocolate coming my way.
  </li><li>I know.
  </li><li>Nope.
  </li><li>You're not allowed to have chocolate.
  </li><li>I know.
  </li><li>Or sugar.
  </li><li>I know.
  </li><li>Sorry, darling.
  </li><li>I know.
  </li><li>What do you want to talk about this week?
  </li><li>I have been thinking a lot.
 I guess I'm gonna generally call this community.
  </li><li>Okay.
 But I've been thinking about the community we're a part of.
 We've talked a lot, it feels like on the podcast
 in the last month or so,
 about how we mean you are really bad at celebrating
 and how good our community is at celebrating
 and how they're doing a fantastic job
 in teaching us to celebrate everything.
  </li><li>Yes, yes.
  </li><li>So I've been thinking about that
 and then of course we're at a wedding
 where everybody came out to celebrate Matt and Tiffany
 and that was beautiful.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 been on the receiving end of the generosity of people in our community.
 Yeah. I mean, we've been the benefactors of people's kindness and giving up time to come and help us
 move house or clean houses or.
 Absolutely.
 But we also in our community get to stand back and watch other people who we benefactors, which we love.
 You know, like, for example, last week at church, somebody got given a car.
 That's right.
 And we've got so many stories of people being given cars or houses or we live in such a generous community
 and culture. I just, I think it's amazing.
 I've been thinking about the value of community. Do you want to hear some stories?
 I want to hear what you've been thinking about.
 You're very kind. Thank you.
 So this weekend, we've got two friends you've heard us talk about them before, Tiffany and Jonathan.
 And we've, we have been delighted in watching them. They've just had a baby, their third baby boy.
 Oh, he's so cute.
 He is absolutely cool.
 He's a squish.
 Yeah. And they have just sold our house and they are just moving at the house. And so,
 having just moved house. I know how busy that can be. And so I texted Jonathan and said,
 Hey, if I can help, let me know like Friday's my day after you. I know that you've got a group
 of guys coming over to help Saturday and more than happy to come help. But do you need any help
 in the run up to that? And so he shot me text, shot me text, he shoot at me a text, he sent me a
 text. Yeah, send me a text and said, on Friday, is random, you know, if you're free, could you come
 over and just help me assemble some furniture and some cribs and whatnot? It's like, sure.
 So I drove over and I was aware that on the Friday is really funny and on Saturday actually,
 Jonathan was so exceptionally gracious and grateful to me showing up.
 In fact, the level of his thanks was if I had saved his firstborn from a flowing river that was
 headed to war, like a 30-foot warfall. And I was like, dude, I'm more than happy to come over with
 the power tool and go back.
 Oh and by the way you helped us move.
 Yeah, but I'm like this.
 I wasn't going over to help him because he helped us.
 We've got to move beyond that level of thinking, but his gratitude was like, oh, thank you so much.
 I can't believe this is your day off.
 And and I was just chuckling because I was like, this really isn't a big deal.
 It's like somebody saying, Oh, thanks for wearing pants today.
 You know, I really appreciate it.
 Well, I'd actually like to thank you for wearing pants today.
 You're welcome.
 So every day I wear pants.
 No.
 And then so i i i i filed that away in my head and and had a little chuckle because i i kind of got where it's coming from because a couple of weeks earlier we were.
 In that same boat you know you're kind of on done when all these people give up their time off to come and help you for sure and it's really humbling so i knew where he's coming from but it was fun.
 to be on one side of the equation receiving the help and then fun to be on the other side of the equation offering the help.
 And but what i loved on Saturday showed up and he had a bunch of guys from his small group all show up and we empty this house and moved house and set stuff up and i what i found out was i was having this.
 Tremendous fun now for those of you know me i don't enjoy being outside of be doing manual labor the most amount of money labor i get is double clicking like oh.
 I'm going to be single and click twice.
 But here I am finding myself having tremendous joy.
 First thing in the morning, loading boxes, you know,
 lifting heavy boxes and moving stuff around and this camaraderie.
 And I'm loving it.
 But what I especially loved is all the guy showed up.
 We're all took about an hour and a half to load the van.
 And then we drive over to Jonathan's house and we all go inside.
 And Jonathan gives us a tour of his house.
 And what I loved was everybody who'd shown up to help joined in and celebrating for Jonathan
 Tiffany, their house.
 Now, it was only Jonathan Tiffany who were moving there, but everybody else was like,
 I love your house.
 So this is amazing.
 And there was people in that group who were trying to buy a house and who haven't
 yet bought a house.
 And there was no sense of, you know, jealousy or frustration.
 You know how sometimes you get around people who are being blessed.
 You have to manage your heart.
 like, "I'm so glad you're being blessed." You know, I'm sure we've all had moments where like,
 "Yay, I'm so glad you got given a third car. I could just do with a car."
 Right, exactly.
 There was none of that. Everybody was super thrilled and super excited and I just loved
 really our community about how happy everybody was. So that was one thing that I was sitting
 watching. And then I came home and realized that in the morning while I was out doing that,
 one of our neighbors had come and taken all three of our kids out for the morning,
 which was amazing. And then in the evening, another set of our neighbors,
 bless them, they came over and helped me in the garden. I say they helped me.
 Really, they did all the work. And I just looked on blank.
 We really are clueless with gardening things. Absolutely clueless. But God bless
 Wes and Deirdre who live right next door. They are like magicians in the fine arts of
 horticulture. So, Burwes got stung by a hornet's nest. Yeah. He did? Yeah, he did. I'm sorry
 about that. Oh, no. Wes was trimming my trees in the pouring rain. I'm standing with an umbrella.
 I'm like, "Are you sure you're okay?" Nice. He's just cutting away. But you offered him tea or
 or something, I'm sure.
 Okay.
 No, the man is a machine.
 He's just fueled by the weather.
 And then tonight he came over and helped us wire up our, what do you call it?
 Dryer.
 The dryer, which wasn't stopped properly.
 Anyway, I was just thinking like, gosh, it's so amazing.
 Our community, like it's so amazing being on the receiving end of it.
 But I really enjoyed, and I was speaking to Richard about this one on the car, I really
 enjoyed this process of giving up time to help other people and find joy in it, not
 just because they're being helped, but finding joy in the process.
 Yeah, I think that's the awesome thing about boundaries, is that, you know, boundaries
 isn't just about saying no, it's being able to say no so that you can say yes to things
 that you want to say yes to.
 you then have the energy and the time and the reserves to be able to do those things.
 And do them willingly.
 Yeah, because you want to, not because you feel manipulated or you have to.
 So, yeah, it's quite fun to be able to go and help other people, isn't it?
 Yeah, Michelle, our emanate pastor was talking about, we did a Walk of Love, so a bunch of
 people in emanate what went up to Nashville and every once in a while there's a ministry
 called Walk of Love and they basically give away food to neighborhoods in Nashville.
 And so our team from emanate went up and Michelle was saying it was so much joy to see a group
 of people.
 Like we had so much joy bounding together, common vision going off and doing this.
 And it's what you said, babe, that misconception of boundaries is that boundaries are about
 saying no.
 But it isn't.
 But it isn't. I mean, you have to say no to prioritize your personal power so you can spend it wisely.
 Yeah.
 One of the things that we thought long and hard about is when we were moving, we wanted to be very careful about who we asked to help us.
 Yeah. I mean, we wanted to be careful because we wanted to make sure that we were asking people that would feel free to say no, that wouldn't feel like, well, we have to help because there are pastors or there are leaders or anything like that.
 but would know that we would be fine with them saying no,
 and that we're just asking them because we trust them to be able to say no,
 and we trust them and we want them in our lives kind of things.
 So that's right.
 And we had several people say no.
 Yeah.
 And I loved that they could say no.
 Absolutely.
 There was no sense where I'm like, Oh, well, you know, that's it.
 Nothing like that.
 People are busy.
 People have busy lives and let's face it.
 You know, manual labor isn't fun.
 Right.
 So I don't play mannerty for saying saying no, but
 What that means is you're safe that people aren't feeling taken advantage of and you're also thrilled that the people who do show up want to be there and fun can be had.
 Yeah, I do think though, I think, I mean, I don't know if I want to say particularly in the south, but it feels like lots of people have been manipulated by whatever just you have to help and particularly when it's pastors, you know, well they're your pastors.
 So you have to do X.
 And I think that's the thing that makes us
 cautious, slash nervous.
 You know, like, actually, I don't want you to come
 and help me with X because I'm your pastor.
 I only want you to come and do that if you want to do that.
  </li><li>Right.
 I remember growing up, my culture that I grew up in,
 there was a lot of, oh, you ought to, or you should do.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And that removes any sense of personal freedom
 or any sense of choice.
  </li><li>Right.
 even if you choose not to, there's this cloud of guilt
 that you're somehow a bad Christian or a bad person.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So you end up not giving away your life.
 You end up having your life subtly taken from you
 and resenting it.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And you know, life worth living is a life worth giving.
 Like you really do find life.
 Didn't get to speak to these people to ask them permission
 to talk about them.
 So I'm gonna talk about them in code.
 We had some--
  </li><li>Vagity, I like it.
 We had some friends call you and just say, "Hey, how are you guys doing with Unpackenhouse?
 We'd love to come over and lend a hand with anything we can."
 You forgot to mention that they were coming or you told me, "They just texted just as
 I was mentioning them."
 Oh my gosh, let me see.
 I texted them earlier to say, "Hey, can I use this story?"
 I'll read what they say and we will tell this story because they quoted.
 So yeah, they contacted you.
 You forgot to tell me or you did tell me
 and I wasn't listening.
 And so on the day they showed up and I was like,
 "Hey, I'm so glad to see you guys.
 Like what are we doing?"
 And they're like, "Oh, we just came over to help you."
  </li><li>I definitely told you.
  </li><li>Details.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>But here's the thing, they look the best
 I've ever seen them.
 I mean, she looked radiant and beautiful.
 And not that she doesn't normally look beautiful
 or not radiant, but she was extra specially shiny.
 And he looked so handsome.
 So I commented to them, like, you guys look like the best I've ever seen you.
 And I said, I can't believe you've given up your Saturday night or Friday night,
 whatever it was to come out and help us.
 And they said, and I can now cope because they texted me, they said,
 we realized we needed to get outside of ourselves and think about how we could help
 others rather than just concerning ourselves with, well, ourselves,
 because we know that serving and outward giving brings joy in a healthy mind.
 Think of it kind of like a body of water that doesn't have a channel for the water
 to flow out of the body.
 Thus the water will cesspool and turn into a swamp
 and let us an outflow happening.
 And we don't want to be a swamp,
 so we need to give ourselves and our time.
 And they said, so it's really funny
 that you comment on how good we're looking
 when we actually deliberately made a choice
 to look outside of ourselves.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Well, we, obviously we totally appreciate it.
 It was so fun.
 I love also in those opportunities
 that we get to know people, like we had some people
 that came and helped us that we really didn't know before.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so that was quite fun too.
 I think the fun thing is in doing stuff together,
 you also get to know each other better.
 So no matter what it is that you're doing,
 whether you're helping at somebody's house,
 or helping moving, or helping a church,
 or whatever it is, it's also just an opportunity,
 again, to build more communities,
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>'Cause you get to know each other and you talk.
 I mean, it's not like you're silent.
 Shannon, our school pastor had this brilliant comment.
 She was talking to about this a little bit and she was listening to Jason
 Valtan's podcast.
 I think it was definitely Jason Valtan.
 I think it was his podcast and he was talking about how he has some great
 spiritual father's and he was talking about how he got them as fathers was
 joining them in the work that they were doing.
 So if they're doing, you know, repair work on their houses, he'd go over and
 help them.
 or if they were working on their car,
 he'd go over and help them.
 And just in the process of giving of his availability,
 they formed a friendship around doing something
 rather than forming a friendship.
 'Cause often, in our past, we've had people who are like,
 "Oh, I really wanna, would you man or me,
 would you connect with me?"
 And you end up with this kind of artificial,
 the reason I am connecting with you is to connect with you
 rather than finding a common bond and which you can connect.
 So anyway, there's no well thought out point here,
 other than to say, we have an amazing community.
 We're thrilled to be a part of it.
 I just love where our community is going
 and I just love the leaders we have in our community.
 They're amazing.
 And other that, that's serving, giving of your time,
 going out of your way to bless somebody else,
 actually does something that ends up boomeranging back on you.
 Yeah.
 It's back to Sony and Reaping, isn't it?
 For sure.
 Given it would be given to you.
 I guess just, you know, sort of return to Matt and Tiffany's wedding.
 It was super fun to be with a bunch of people that all, you know, love and could celebrate
 Matt and Tiffany and just, you know, we didn't go for a free dinner.
 we went because we're excited about what God's doing in their lives and we get to be part
 of it.
 I think that's one of the things I love too about the declarations and the vows at the
 beginning of the ceremony where they're saying, "Hey, this is your intention, isn't it, Matt,
 to Mary, Tiffany and behave like this?"
 "Yes."
 "Tiffany, this is your intention, isn't it, to behave like this?"
 "Mary, Matt, yes."
 "Hey, people that are here, you're part of this larger community.
 Is it your intention to uphold this marriage
 and to help them into whatever?
 And we all say, we will.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I love that part,
 'cause I'm like, gosh, you know,
 I'm sitting at this wedding because I'm saying yes.
 You know, I think this is a great idea
 and I wanna see it succeed.
 And I love the challenge of that,
 that hey, marriage is a community thing.
 You need help, you know.
 And then add kids to that scenario,
 it takes a village, you know.
 So I love, I love the community even of that,
 of us getting to kind of stand with them and say, yeah, I'm in this with you.
 And I'm here and I'm available to help.
 But it was, it was fun.
 It was fun to see so many just solid, solid people at that wedding that are,
 you know, going to be part of the support structure for a new family.
 So I love communities.
 Good God knew what he was doing when he made community.
 Yes, he did.
 Well done, God.
 Two thumbs up.
 All right.
 Are you ready for a listening question?
 I believe I am a continue our theme of relationships, which you know, we got all these
 listeners questions in and nobody knows what anybody else is sending.
 But here's a brilliant one.
 Okay.
 AJ always talks about how girls can imagine things and plan their future and
 obsess over everything about a guy before they even know the guy.
 I have struggled with this exact thing for years.
 And as a senior in college, I would love some advice for how to stop doing this
 because it has only led me to heartbreak and stress and anxiety when it comes to relationships.
 I feel like I get so ahead of myself and jump into things and then I get to know the guy and he doesn't live up to my made up version of him.
 And so I end up disappointed every time.
 Sure, how could he made it?
 You know, actually live up to your made up version.
 You're you can come up with some pretty amazing stuff.
 You girls can go psycho.
 Yeah, in your imagination.
 Yeah.
 And if you're really good with Photoshop, you end up with creepy albums of what your children will look like in the future.
 It's like that movie. Do you remember the 10 things?
 There was there was some movie where they made up a book.
 I think that would be an effective way of getting rid of them.
 Yeah, I mean, how do you stop doing that? Well,
 don't let yourself even start down the track of daydreaming about it until he's at least said that he's really interested in you and wants to pursue you.
 Do you know what I mean?
 Because I think, I think again,
 we get way out over our skis thinking,
 well, he's sweet and he loves Jesus
 and you know, it could be this and it could be that.
 And before we know it, we've fallen in love
 with a person that doesn't exist
 'cause we don't actually know them.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And that seems like what's happening for you
 is your imagination is creating something
 that actually isn't there in the fact
 that he isn't that person
 because you don't actually know him.
 And your heart is now invested in a fantasy.
 So how do you do it?
 You just have to stop.
 You just have to literally go,
 "Oh, I'm starting to do that thing.
 "I've seen a Christian male
 "and I'm all of a sudden thinking they're my spouse.
 "I'm not gonna go there."
 You know?
  </li><li>This must be one of those big differences
 between a guy and a girl thing,
 'cause I don't think guys do that.
 So it's hard for me to believe
 that this is actually something that occupies
 the CPU cycles of women's brains.
 Well, I don't know if it's all women necessarily, but I've certainly watched the scenario happen
 a number of times.
 I want to know what your imagination version of me was when you first met me.
 Yeah, I wasn't doing that anymore by the time I met you.
 I was...
 Why were you not doing that?
 You'd learn it at disappoints?
 Yeah, I mean, I'd already given that cycle over to the Lord.
 I had, I think there was one fellow that I had just really, really liked.
 And of course, I think very unwise friends would weigh in and say,
 oh, you guys would be great together.
 And that would just sort of feed that thing of like, yeah, we would.
 &gt;&gt; We would be great together.
 &gt;&gt; And then later on down the road,
 do you end up just like your heart is trashed over something that was never real?
 And I was just like, gosh, I'm not doing this again.
 God, I need to place my heart in your hands.
 And I'm asking you, don't let me go there.
 Like just don't let me go there until
 this handsome Scotsman comes along and sweeps me off my feet.
 And then today you came.
  </li><li>There wasn't that much.
  </li><li>Although it was years later.
  </li><li>It was somewhat clunky and awkward.
  </li><li>I know, I'm just trying to make it seem like it was sweeping.
  </li><li>So is it the same, I guess the same rules apply
 any, you know, take every thought cap of the Christ, which would mean when those thoughts
 pop in your head, don't entertain them.
 Yeah.
 And then have some accountability.
 Yeah.
 And we say this all the time when we do relationship talks and, you know, dating done right talks
 and all that kind of stuff.
 If he has not said that he's interested in you, he isn't.
 Just put it to rest.
 He isn't.
 I'm not sure if the person who asked us question has listened to our teaching on dating.
 you can find it on our website, <a href="mailto:allen@ag.com">allen@ag.com</a>.
 We have a whole five part series on sexual healing
 and it goes from everything from a good biblical basis
 for sex and sexuality,
 but also includes this whole teaching on dating.
 And we go into a little bit of detail
 on the two pitfalls for men and women when it comes to dating.
 So if you haven't listened to that,
 that might be helpful, but in a nutshell, stop it.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Yeah, you kind of just have to choose to stop it.
 Value your heart enough to stop it.
 Thanks.
 If you are within driving distance of Nashville, we have got an incredible event
 we'd like to talk about.
 Our good friends, Lyle and Allison Phillips are hosting their annual Go
 conference. It's running September 8th through 10th.
 That's a Thursday night, Friday and Saturday.
 Heidi Baker.
 Awesome.
 Ben and Leepshire.
 Very good.
 Lyle, Alex and Henry Sealy, who we interviewed will be speaking at the conference.
 Yeah.
 We're also going to be sharing a little bit too.
 Plus worship is going to be believable.
 Oh, the worst of the years they have coming are outstanding.
 Jesus culture artist, Chris McLawney, who we've also interviewed on the podcast,
 Christine DeMarco, Beth on music's Hunter Thompson and Sean fight.
 I haven't heard Sean.
 I haven't either.
 I've heard great things about him.
 I've heard great things about Hunter as well.
 Plus others are going to be leading.
 It sounds like it's going to be a killer conference.
 I don't know how they're going to fit everything in to just three days.
 I don't know.
 I remember their last Go conference.
 I thought that too and they did it.
 It was amazing.
  </li><li>Well, I can't wait to just attend it.
 Nevermind, get to share it to it.
 I spoke to Lyle about it.
 I was like, Lyle, why would you like us to share
 on the conference about missions?
 He's like, it's not about missions
 'cause we're not missionaries.
 And he was like, it's actually a leadership
 and missions conference.
 So we're gonna do a leadership track
 and we're gonna do a missions track.
 So if you have got a heart for going to the nations
 in missions. If you've got a heart for reaching your community, this is going to be a fantastic
 conference. We'd love you to go. They've got a sale on tickets that ends on next Friday,
 which is I think the 19th. We could be making that up. Tickets are just $60 each. Go to
 goconferenceneishville.com for details or just look in the show notes at alanajir.com/115
 for this week's episode and you'll find a link to that.
 If you want to ask us a question, we would love to answer it on air.
 You would do that by going to alanah.com/ask.
 And lastly, if you could do is a huge favor.
 Many of you have already and we really appreciate it.
 But if you can go to iTunes and leave us a review on our podcast page, it's super helpful.
 The more reviews we get, the more notice iTunes pays attention to us and the more we get
 previewed on their page.
 And it just allows our podcast to reach audience members that might never ever find us.
 And we want them to experience the joy that is keeping up with the Joneses.
 I mean, just think they've never heard our jingle.
 That's tragic.
 They've never heard these strange hybrid accents.
 It's true.
 Tragic.
 Thanks so much for listening to us.
 We will see you next week.
