<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>80 Jones?
  </li><li>Yes, sir.
  </li><li>Episode 232 of Keeping Up With The Joneses.
  </li><li>I know, it's shocking, we're back!
  </li><li>We're back and it's 2021.
  </li><li>Yes, also shocking that it's 2021 and we're back.
 Yes.
  </li><li>Didn't I just say that?
 Okay, let's start again.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Just leave it, let's just keep going.
 (laughing)
 AJ Jones.
  </li><li>Yes, sir.
  </li><li>Look at you, you find piece of Canadian engineering.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>You look gorgeous.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>Is it true that you put on some perfume?
  </li><li>I did, right before we came down.
  </li><li>So I go into just actually putting a shirt
 because, you know, I'm still working from home
 when I was in Moppa Jammas.
 And I walk into the bedroom and I'm like,
 did you just put cologne on?
 That's so unfair.
 So I put a cologne on too.
 So there, do you can play that game.
  </li><li>Well, it's kind of our little thing, isn't it?
 Sometimes when we go out on dates, we wait to the very end
 and then I'll put on perfume, just 'cause I know
 I'll get a good response.
  </li><li>You do, you put on a cent and that drives me crazy.
 Anyway, welcome to episode 232 of "Keeping Up With The Joneses."
 If you're just joining us,
 we are a husband and wife podcasting.
  </li><li>Yep, and we live in Franklin, Tennessee.
  </li><li>And if it's confusing you that we're from Tennessee
 and we don't sound like it,
 That's because I'm from Canada and you're from Scotland.
 Or the other way around.
 I was going to see if I could even tell.
 Yeah.
 Welcome to episode two, 32.
 If you're new to the podcast, this is what we do.
 We talk, we ostensibly talk about our topic, but sometimes it takes us a while
 together.
 If you're not new to the podcast, welcome back.
 Although we should kind of be saying, yeah, sorry, we were away so long.
 We had an interesting six months or so.
 Well, probably like everybody who's listening, you probably had an interesting here.
 Here's what happened.
 Our last episode of this podcast was in June 29th, we released it.
 So the end of June 2020.
 And as we were wrapping up, we were like, Hey, we'll be back in the fall, which was our plan.
 And, uh, and then that didn't happen.
 No.
 And I thought it would be fun before we even get into anything explaining to our
 beautiful audience where we have been for the last six months.
 those of you who know us probably know what happened, but it's good to recap because
 misery loves company.
 But what about for those that don't know us, like don't know?
 Then they don't know we've been missing.
 You don't know.
 You have no idea.
 You just think it's like this all the time.
 It's just this is this is the dream right here.
 Our plan was to come back in the fall because we were going to have somebody join us and
 that person has joined us.
 In fact, that person is in the studio right now.
 Mr. Chris, our goal was to have Chris join us in the fall and help us with the production
 of the podcast. And that was the plan. But then what happened to you, Jones?
 Well, end of June, I got really sick, went down with mono,
 which is glandular fever if you're not from North America.
 And spent nine weeks, I think, in bed. I remember when when I first got, you know,
 got tested for COVID, I just knew I was sick, ran a fever for 28 days.
 And so, you know, when in got all the different tests done, they're like, no,
 you don't have COVID.
 Yay.
 Uh, you have mono.
 And, um, I read up about it and it said, you know, average mono is two to four weeks.
 And I thought I'm going to nail it into like I'm just going to work out for you.
 Yeah.
 So yeah, I spent, uh, I think it was nine weeks in bed, nine weeks in bed, lap
  </li><li>Laughter luxury, just really--
  </li><li>Laughter luxury, felt great.
  </li><li>You hated it.
  </li><li>Just laying in bed, no, it was awful.
  </li><li>We've talked about, and I mean this in the kindest way,
 but like the worst patient in the world is you.
 And that you won't let me care for you.
  </li><li>I disagree.
 Okay, I think I'm the best patient in the world.
 I am low maintenance, just leave me alone.
 (laughs)
 I am like, I think because when I was a kid,
 like we had--
  </li><li>Really, you're gonna bring your childhood in.
  </li><li>This is as a monitor of hell.
  </li><li>No, I'm not saying that.
 I'm just saying this is how I got created.
 We had governesses, but my mom worked, my dad worked.
 And so I remember when I was sick.
  </li><li>You were neglected and abandoned.
  </li><li>Okay, that's your view of it,
 but I would just lie on the couch
 and eat if somebody brought me food,
 but otherwise I was just alone.
 And that's sort of what I associate with being sick,
 is like you are left alone.
  </li><li>And when I'm sick, when I was sick as a child,
 I was doted on. - I mean, I wasn't high maintenance.
  </li><li>Oh, you're so high maintenance.
 (laughing)
 You're like, listen, what?
  </li><li>I'm high maintenance.
  </li><li>Over here, I'm at my temples.
 Aren't you gonna sing to me?
 You're at my tummy, I don't feel good.
 You're high maintenance, it's a nightmare.
  </li><li>Listen.
  </li><li>One person's abandonment is another person's peace and quiet.
 Another person's fear and attentive is high maintenance.
  </li><li>Okay, I am like, hey, if you drop off food, that's great.
 If you don't, I can wait.
 And you're like, I need a drink, I need this.
 Can you go to public?
 I need Rybena.
 Nobody needs Rybena when they're sick.
 Rybena is not a health drink.
 It's a sugar drink.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>As you can imagine, those nine weeks
 that aging was in bed and didn't come out the room,
 couldn't come out the room.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 to raise. I took over all your responsibilities at work. So for those nine weeks, like life
 was not really conducive to podcasting. Oh, also we opened the church. Yeah. In the
 midst of all that, we opened the church with trying to, you know, follow guidelines and
 all this kind of things. So and then we, so yeah, that was miserable. It was awful.
 And lonely, like I was so lonely. We just done a whole podcast series on feelings and
 I always saw lonely.
  </li><li>And we also had to switch over to taking our whole school
 into an online format.
 So it was like, there was just extra things to do everywhere.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And then, we go through a couple of different phases
 of reopening Grace Center and we get to the phase
 that we're currently in where we have two services.
 Our first service is a socially distant mask mandatory
 service for people who that's their preference.
 And then our second service is no masks,
 social distancing for people who that's their preference. And so we're trying to serve two
 different needs in our community. The very first week that gets launched our beloved senior
 pastor Jeff Daller stands up and tells the church, "I'm going on Family Leave, poor Jeff as the
 dollar family who we love and adore have just been through serious trail."
  </li><li>Serious, serious tragic circumstances. And Jeff took a leave of absence,
 which we were so proud of him for doing that, to go care for his family. And so that was a,
 you know, welcome back to Grace Center. And I'm Jeff Dower, and I'm going to be leaving.
 And in Jeff's absence, A.G. and I stepped up, along with many of our team to help oversee and
 help run the church. And so for the subsequent five months after that, all of our spare time
 got, you know, in addition to my job, I started teaching on Sundays every week, Grace and almost
 every week, you and Tony and with some guest speakers. But that ramped up. So though we had
 brilliant and I can't overstate how brilliant Chris is, though we had brilliant Chris to help us,
 he couldn't help us podcast because we were not available to podcast.
 No.
 So I apologize. I like to be a man of my word. So in June last year, today we'll be back in the
 fall and we didn't come back in the fall. I had a lot of sadness. But oh, we also forgot to mention
 And that during all that, you also got COVID.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, I decided that it would be great
 to have both things, mono and COVID,
 so I could compare them, which is very exciting.
 Yeah, I got better, well, I got better from mono
 than a week later my back went out,
 we think 'cause I'd lied in bed for so long.
  </li><li>You're back on that, yeah, you're back on that.
  </li><li>Then it, we got that sorted, then it went out again,
 then we got that sorted, I had about two weeks
 where I was functional, and then I got COVID.
 So when we evaluate our fall, how many weeks do you spend in bed?
 I spent about four months in bed, or just locked up in the guest room, basically.
 Yeah, it was our quarantine hospital.
 I put her in there, put an air-pear fire outside her door, and nobody went in.
 Which again-- It was awful.
 I didn't get to see the kids. No, you're fine, because when you're sick,
 you just get to be left alone. No, but I miss the kids.
 Not so much you right now, but--
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong>
  </li><li>The 28 days of fever with mono was the worst part
 because it wasn't until I was three days.
  </li><li>But you also have 13 days of fever with COVID.
  </li><li>Yeah, I did, yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, the kids and I spent many like a lonely meal,
 you know, looking at Russianbrides.com
 for a placement mommy and.
  </li><li>But they couldn't find anyone, so it's all fine.
 Thanks, darling.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh, yeah.
  </li><li>Hell, it just wasn't gonna work out.
  </li><li>That was a miserable, miserable time.
  </li><li>It was. - And yeah, it feels
 like ages ago, it doesn't feel like
 a long time ago.
  </li><li>It does, yeah, we're three months into being healthy.
 I mean, I feel, I didn't start really feeling myself
 energy-wise and stuff until near the end of January
 from COVID, but yeah.
  </li><li>Like didn't you get out of bed just before Christmas Eve
 so you could celebrate Christmas?
  </li><li>20 second I came out of quarantine, so.
  </li><li>Wow.
 So if you were wondering, hey, where were the Jones?
 That's a little sneak peek into what happened with that.
 So I feel like we need to bring in some happiness.
 Well, that was happiness.
 I mean, in terms of like, there's been tough stuff
 with COVID for sure.
 But we've had tons of family time,
 tons of what we've had a couple new video games,
 which MJ enjoys, which watching him enjoy something
 is quite fun.
 I think what we've done more recently, but really last year, it was a home buddy year.
 Yeah, I understand that. I mean, we're still working from home.
 Yeah, I mean, I don't know what it's like for you. I don't know where you are in the world.
 I've got, you know, we've got friends all over the world. And depending on where you are in the world,
 your nation's response to COVID largely dictates the your response to COVID and your quality of life.
 But, you know, it has been hard and yeah, there is tremendous joy, there is tremendous
 gladness.
 I mean, I'm kind of playing the, you know, there was nothing good.
 There was tons of good stuff, lots of quality time.
 Yeah.
 We did get to go camping, which was fun.
 Yeah.
 A couple of weeks ago, we went away for spring break.
 We weren't going camping actually, because we rented a trailer and this lovely guy whoYou 
 say trailer and I think about a thing that gets attached to the back of a truck
 that you just shove old pieces of wood in our old couch.
  </li><li>Oh, no, no, no, like an RV trailer thing.
  </li><li>Yeah, like a 30-
  </li><li>That house, right? - That house, right?
  </li><li>Right? - Right?
  </li><li>Mobile home. - Yes.
  </li><li>Which was inside that glamorous.
  </li><li>No, no, it's great.
 It had like a separate bedroom for us,
 and it had, you know, big TV,
 and so, I mean, there was a couple days of rain,
 we were able to play games with the kids,
 or as, you know, we could eat and cook inside.
 There was a bunk room, you know?
 So it was pretty great.
 And then, you know, we got to get outside,
 and MJ's favorite thing was the rock throwing, apparently.
 Yeah, my boy would just stand beside the water
 and throw rocks into the water for hours.
 Hours. And loved it.
 And I was like, you go, son, I'm here watching Netflix and a hammock.
 You just, you go.
 You were watching Netflix in your hammock?
 Yeah. Really? Okay.
 Well, there you go.
 I didn't know you were watching Netflix.
 It was mostly prayer and Bible study with like an outbreak of Netflix.
 Yeah, just interspersed.
 Well, I tell you the truth. We have, we, oh, I'm going to say I've missed podcasting.
 I didn't even check with you, but I've absolutely missed podcasting.
 So I'm glad to be back in your ear holes.
 I didn't even check with you.
 I mean, I don't want to say we.
 I'm excited to be back.
 You are good. Yeah. Yeah.
 So what are we talking about this week?
 Um, I think you picked the topic.
 So why don't you launch it onto the people?
 Well, here's the thing.
 A couple of weeks ago, I got a prophetic word from our dear friend.
 David Wagner, who's at church, and he profsied, he gave me prophetic word, which he's given
 me before, and I've had a couple of these words, but about writing a book. And I thought,
 I don't want to ignore that. You know, just because it doesn't ring a bell with me doesn't
 mean it's not the Lord. But I was like, I don't even know where I'd start with writing a book.
 So I did lazy market research. I went on to Instagram and just said, Hey, if I was going to write a
 book, what kind of book would you be interested in reading? And people gave me a ton of topics.
 And I thought, you know what, I might not write a book on any of those topics, but they just gave
 us like months worth of podcast topics. And so this is from somebody who on Instagram said,
 "Hey, I would like you to write a book about what do we call the title? Chris, was it drawing closer
 to God? How to get more of God. How to get more of God. What a great title."
 It is a good title. So, Ajay Jones, how have you over the years got more of God?
 Well, I mean, the main one would be time spent, you know, like in terms of spending time in the
 the word spending time.
 Yeah, but what does that look like? Talk to me through what does it look like for AJ Jones
 to spend time in the word?
 It's different in different seasons. So sometimes it's been, you know, where you're
 doing the Read the Bible in a year, that sort of thing. Most often it's been, Lord, what
 are we going to read today and just sort of reading? But I tend to like to look at it
 and multiple versions and open up a chordance
 and see what that word is in the Greek or in the Hebrew.
 Like I like to kind of really dig
 and digest little chunks and spend a while there.
 So remember--
  </li><li>What will that look like?
 You'll literally open up your Bible
 and you'll ask the Holy Spirit,
 like what are we gonna read today?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And then will you stay in that for a while?
 Or just see and you'll just read.
  </li><li>Yeah, typically.
 I mean, sometimes I'll just read.
 But for example, last year, right before I got sick,
 I spent like four months just reading Matthew
 because it was sort of slow going
 in that the Lord sort of kept stopping me and saying,
 now I want you to really look at this.
 Like don't just go past it.
 You know, I want you to really look into this
 and then I'd spend time journaling about what I saw
 and asking the Lord questions and then research
 a few things and then I'd keep going a little bit further.
 So it was super slow going through the book of Matthew
 which is why it took me months.
  </li><li>You mentioned journaling
 and I'm wondering if some of our listeners,
 that might be a new phrase to them.
 When you say journaling, you mean what?
  </li><li>I mean, having a conversation with God
 that you're writing down.
  </li><li>So you'll read something and you'll ask him
 about what you've just read.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>It's handy knowing the author, isn't it?
  </li><li>It is handy.
 And I find like, even when I was first starting
 to read the Bible, like when I first got saved,
 I would have like, no-ings, which I didn't realize
 was the Holy Spirit telling me things,
 but I would just, I would either see pictures
 that I was like, what was that?
 you know, and I'd realize, oh, this is the Lord showing me what's going on here.
 And I started actually really early on.
 And I can't remember who told me to do it.
 I know somebody did, but asking the Holy Spirit, can you, when you don't understand
 what you're reading, Lord, can you show me what was happening?
 Like, can you show me?
 And often I would either have, vision is too strong a word, but something on the,
 on the screen of my mind where I would sort of see something or get a sense of
 some of what was happening. And then often you can go back and do some research and go,
 Oh, that that was that. Yeah, this is that. So I, but I am like, I like research. I like history.
 I like so I love going back in and doing all the digging to kind of mine up.
 You say that and I don't know if I've told you about this. I got a new tool. So we use a piece of
 software for our Bible study called Accordance is available for Mac and Windows.
 There's lots of different ones. We like Accordance. There's a tool in Accordance
 I need to show you called the timeline tool and whatever you're reading when
 you click on it it shows you a timeline of world events and it shows you a
 timeline of where it was in the Bible and what other books overlap with what
 you're reading. So when I was preparing all that work on you know Nero and I don't
 And I don't want to answer that because you may beat me, but I need to show you like I was just thinking this is so cool
 I never thought I would be the type of person that would be super interested in the historical context of
 Books I am now, but also the geography
 I know we're getting super nerdy here and it's not like I sit down with a Bible at this every time we read the Bible
 But remind me to show you about the timeline tool in accordance below your mind
 Okay, where I'm like I'm reading through Matthew and because I've been in Israel
 You know, I will look up everything that I've taken for granted every little city any of them that still exists
 I'll look through like any pictures of the ruins. I'm trying to like fill in
 Understanding as I'm going I love that stuff. Yeah, so yeah, you know my mom and dad be thrilled say that the BIBLE is the book for you
 it is but yes, it is so
 my
 Of course, of course, I'm gonna read the Bible
 But my probably number one linchpin for me having received more of God is absolutely time spent,
 but I would probably put time spent journaling to, which is another way of praying. Like my prayer
 life mostly looks like me writing out my prayers to the Lord. Like I can type as almost as fast as
 I can talk. Like I'm a very fast touch-tiper. So for me, I can't. I'm a T-rex-tiper. I only have
 I only have these fingers available and it's pretty shoddy at best.
 Okay, well, it's one thing I love learning about in high school.
 I can touch type and so I will just like I'm in a instant message with God.
 I will type out my prayers to the Lord.
 And I don't even think I'm praying.
 I'm just talking father.
 I just do you know what to come and be with you to them just writing all that out.
 Then I'll usually ask him a question and as soon as I wait, I will hear him respond.
 I will hear an audible stream that sounds like my voice, but I know it's not my voice.
 And I'll just write it down.
 And so my prayer life, if you were to read my journal,
 looks like a transcript of a conversation between two people.
 And so prayer, look at us, we're great evangelicals.
 Bible study and prayer are the keys to connection.
 There are certainly two of them.
 There are two bed rocks, prayer and Bible study.
 But I think like the reason I wanted to explain what my prayer life looks like,
 otherwise you think I'm on my knees beside my bed and it's just a one-sided conversation.
 And the two biggest things that changed my prayer life, one, learning to pray out loud,
 which is not difficult, you just don't pray inside, you pray out loud. But then second of all,
 learning how to journal. And in a second, we'll give you links to episodes where we've talked
 about these topics in depth. So if this is new to you, you can go listen to those episodes and
 and you know, find out more about journaling, find out more about hearing God's voice. But
 I think I think the other big thing for me is soaking.
 Talk about that.
 So, I've heard different people define soaking different ways, for sure.
 When I'm saying soaking, I mean, I am listening to music, I am not praying, I'm not journaling,
 I'm not reading anything.
 I am listening to usually soft music that helps me connect with the Holy Spirit, connect
 with Jesus and I'm just receiving whatever it is that God wants to do at that moment.
 And sometimes I'm unaware of what he's doing.
 And other times I'll see things or hear things and lots of times I just cry because I can
 feel the presence of God.
 And again, I'm not usually aware of what he's doing, but I just feel his presence and just
 so soaking in his presence and taking him in.
 That's what I mean.
 The reason I'm shaking my head is how to any evangelicals of which I'd put myself in
 that category, who's listening to the super like, "Yep, I'm on board with prayer.
 Yep, I'm on board with Bible study.
 Yeah, that journal thing sounds a little bit weird, soaking sounds preposterous."
 And I remember that thing.
 I remember when I was like, "Really?
 This is a key to intimacy, just lying down and listening to music and not doing anything.
 How can that do anything?"
 But you think about the richness of our relationship is because we've spent tons of time together
 and that time hasn't been intentional conferences.
 I haven't been reading study books about you.
 It's just time spent where we learn what each other's size mean,
 size as an, you know, not size.
 I was like, it means I ate too much chocolate.
 I was like, what?
 You know, you learn about somebody by spending time with them.
 Yeah.
 And I can trace back some of the...
 I want to be careful what I say.
 like the long journey, the perpetual decades that I've got with the Lord, yes, have been fueled by
 prayer and Bible study, consistent prayer, consistent Bible reading, consistent being in the word.
 But also I can point to times in my life where I got kick started or an upgrade or a new phase
 of connection with the Lord. And I would say arguably they came through experience. Now I'm not
 lauding experience over Bible study or by prayer, but you know, our faith was never supposed to be
 be intellectual, our face was never supposed to be theoretical. It's
 intellectual, it's experiential. The Bible is a book of people having
 experiences with God. And I would say soaking absolutely has positioned. I
 would say that the Lord has broken in while I've been soaking. And I have also
 positioned myself to receive from the Lord with soaking. I'm going to put
 my notes because we're already away and I want to tell people episodes. Like if
 you're listening to this and you're thinking, I want to know more about that.
 If you want to know more about soaking, we did a whole episode, episode 190. If
 If you ever want to read this into an episode, all you need to do is go to Alan and AJ.com/
 and then whatever the episode number in this case, 192.
 That's where we talk all about soaking.
 Okay.
 If you want more information about journaling, we've done a couple of episodes about that.
 Episode 18, episode 204.
 We've even talked about prayer in episode 183, but here's a verse I was thinking about.
 When I was thinking about like, how do you get more of God?
 Hebrews 11, 6 says that God rewards those who earnestly seek Him.
 And I don't know if the specific mechanisms by which you seek Him
 matter so much as the heart that is intent on pursuing Him and seeking Him.
 Like, I didn't like when I started my journey into what I'm in now,
 I didn't know any of the stuff I'm talking about now.
 But God honored my feeble efforts at drawing near Him.
 Like all I knew how to do, and I'm not saying one word saying X is feeble,
 All I knew how to do was kneel down beside my bed
 because it was the only model of prayer I knew.
 And the Lord honored that.
 And then he taught me other things.
 Some of the other things were talking about.
  </li><li>That makes so much sense.
 If you think about the fact that he is a wonderful father,
 if you think about our kids,
 when they try and do something
 that we can maybe do with great ease,
 they're nowhere near as sophisticated.
 It takes longer and it's a little clumsy,
 but it's absolutely endearing,
 watching them try and make the grilled cheese sandwich
 try and do whatever. And it makes sense to me that the father's like, you know what, I'm loving.
 I'm going to honor you. Yeah, you're stretching out towards me. And I'm, I don't care what it
 looks like. Chris in the studio here just reminded us, he was like, Hey, it might be a good time
 to remind the people that you actually wrote a book about everything you've talked about so far.
 So you've written a book that is a study guide, it's 12 week guide to learn how intentionally to
 to learn how to soak, to learn how to hear God's voice.
 It's called Finding Father.
 If you haven't read it, you can get it
 at our website to at allenagio.com.
 We'll put a link to that book in the show notes.
 And also, if you're not a person that likes reading,
 you also produced a whole video course.
  </li><li>I did.
  </li><li>Where you systematically teach people through it.
  </li><li>All of this stuff.
 Same stuff.
  </li><li>If you're a visual learner, rather than like a reading learner,
 you might wanna watch those videos.
 They're available at the same place too.
 So we talked about time.
 Like, I remember a hero of mine said,
 You can have as much of God as you want.
 And I took him at that challenge.
 There's no shortcuts, just time.
 Time spent in his word, time spent with him,
 time spent in prayer, time spent journaling, all of that.
  </li><li>Well, it's drawn near to God and he will draw near to you.
  </li><li>Look at you, just quote in script,
 you're like a boss. - Thank you, thank you.
  </li><li>The other thing I wrote down,
 as I was thinking about this, was one I'm not a huge fan of,
 and the other one I'm a huge fan of.
 The one I'm not a huge fan of is fasting.
  </li><li>But nobody likes fasting.
  </li><li>Well, I kinda liked it a little while.
  </li><li>There's psychos out there who love this, fasting.
 We've generally got different experiences
 regarding fasting.
 Like we're both pro-fasting,
 and fasting is a way of life for us.
 But when we talk about it,
 we have very different experiences and outcomes.
 You share your views on fasting,
 and I'll talk about mine.
  </li><li>Well, I mean, I also have the realization
 that having in my teenage years,
 having had an eating disorder,
 I sometimes--
  </li><li>Sometimes I'm going to call it several eating disorders.
  </li><li>It's not beyond the...
  </li><li>I sometimes, I can go without food
 and it doesn't really bother me.
  </li><li>I have never had that problem in my life.
  </li><li>Like I can forget to have lunch
 and not realize I haven't had lunch.
  </li><li>Again, literally not an issue for me.
  </li><li>So, but I mean, I've had great experiences fasting.
 I've definitely sometimes fasted for the wrong reasons.
 Like I have, my fasts have been more of a hunger strike.
 Like God, I'm gonna twist your arm
 and make you try and tell me stuff.
 that workout was successful.
  </li><li>Well, I mean, sometimes I did actually hear things, you know?
 So it's kind of funny 'cause it's like,
 that's not a good idea, but God in His goodness
 was still like, okay, listen,
 I'm gonna help you out here, you know?
 Which is sweet.
 And then I had a friend of mine who was a pastor challenged me
 and say, 'cause I would do 40 day fasts.
 And they said, I think based on your history,
 this isn't your best idea.
 And I think your previous eating disorder stuff
 is feeding into stuff.
 So I stopped doing those.
 But I have had plenty of experiences where,
 while fasting, I do feel closer to God,
 I do get information,
 it's probably not the right,
 but revelation and breakthrough.
  </li><li>And that would say that's the big difference
 between you and I when we fast.
 Like when I fast, it's not that immisurable.
  </li><li>Grumpy, definitely grumpy.
  </li><li>Apparently I am miserable.
 Well, I'm fasting, like, you know, Jeff is the same.
 Jeff and you are in the same camp.
 When they're fasting, they love it.
 There's a real payoff for not eating.
  </li><li>And I usually feel pretty good.
  </li><li>There's a high, when I'm fasting, I don't enjoy it at all.
 And usually the reward or the breakthrough comes after.
 It is not concurrent.
 It seems to be with so many of my friends
 that I'm fasting and I feel so close to the Lord.
 I feel grumpy and I just wanna eat when I'm fasting.
 Generally speaking, I've got a few of those,
 but by and large, fasting has produced dividends afterwards.
 And if you want to know more about fasting,
 we did a whole episode on episode 167.
  </li><li>Oh, I forgot.
  </li><li>That was the one I don't like.
  </li><li>You've done a lot of episodes.
 I didn't realize we talked about that,
 but I think we have, yeah.
  </li><li>Here's the other thing I thought about.
 The importance in consistently growing close to God
 over years is the importance of witnessing or testimony.
 The whole idea that when you talk about God,
 you get more of God.
 When you talk about God, it solidifies.
 When you tell testimonies about when God's come through for you in the past, it actually
 opens the door for faith for what you're facing right now.
 Think about David, the reason he was confident he could go up against Goliath, and he says
 this to Saul, he's like, "Hey, the same God that kept me from the lion and the bear,
 he's going to keep me safe from this giant.
 Don't even worry about it."
 There is something beautiful, which I honestly think is why I love podcasting is when we
 We are talking about stuff we already know, expression reinforces impression.
 When we witness, when we have an opportunity to share our faith with others, it bolsters
 our faith.
 And when we don't, when we don't talk about what God's doing, when we don't give testimony,
 actually our faith begins to atrophy.
 We begin to shrivel.
 And so that wasn't something I've historically thought about.
 That's an important thing to do, but I was thinking it super important.
 I would probably also pair that with community.
 Like I think living in community and having community that's actively involved and can call you forward on stuff and can call you out on stuff
 And you can share your life with and you can hear their experiences and be encouraged when you're low all that kind of stuff
 I think that also helps you in terms of in pursuit of God
 But I was thinking when you were just
 Saying your your previous point about sharing testimony. I heard an amazing testimony this week on the school
 Tell me an amazing task.
 Okay.
 So this wonderful guy, and I won't use names because I haven't asked permission, but one
 of the wonderful year one students who came on the school is one of our, what do we call
 them?
 MLEs, mature life experience students.
 So you know, he's, I don't know how old he is actually 50, 60, somewhere in there and grew
 up more conservative and that kind of stuff.
 So he came to the school and learned about hearing God's voice.
 He's been a Christian forever, but never knew this.
 And it's been like hearing God voice the journaling that we've been talking about.
 How to do hearing God's voice and how to hear it in the journal.
 And so, but he's been active in his church and all that kind of stuff.
 So anyway, he learns this.
 He's found it transformational for him.
 So he actually did a Zoom call with all of his guys at his, like,
 in his church community, all the people that he's grown up with and whatever.
 and led them through a message on hearing God's voice
 that he prepared to do on the school.
 But he let, and now all these guys,
 all these, you know, friends of his, yeah, are, are,
 are practical.
  </li><li>You only get to keep what you give away.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's amazing.
  </li><li>And that's why we need to be active in our faith,
 like putting into practice what we've learned,
 and you got it.
 When I was a school teacher,
 one of the things they taught us was about
 like different teaching methods, or pedagogy,
 different ways of teaching.
  </li><li>Say the big words again.
 I know it's not between that and my, you know,
 Cologne will never get this podcast done.
 And I'll be embarrassing for Chris.
 They were teaching about different ways of learning.
 So, you know, there's auditory learning,
 which is largely what we're doing right now.
 We're talking in your ears as, you know,
 visual learning, this kinesthetic learning
 where people learn by doing.
 And they said that by far the most successful way
 of teaching for retention is teaching.
 You retain 90% of what you teach.
  </li><li>Yes.
 If you're somebody who is active in sharing your faith or active, like this gentleman,
 in sharing the breakthrough that you've just had, it reinforces and that's why recall is
 so important.
 Yeah, so good.
 Yeah.
 What we're talking about fasting, we're talking about witnessing, you're talking about community.
 I also thought there's no substitute for experience and we touched on this a little bit with
 soaking but I think about that verse that says be not here to the word only and so
 deceiv yourself do what it says the most important thing for growth is putting
 into practice what you already know there's a huge temptation for us to go
 from one prophetic word to another I mean us as Christians like I just want to
 hear yeah and I'm like actually it's so much more important rather than
 constantly looking for what the new thing is is to be faithful with what the
 The last thing was right right what we've talked about that before the whole thing of like we've done over 200
 I've thought about everything before you don't feel like you're hearing from God go back to the last thing
 You heard and check out if you did it right, so but there's there's definitely something about
 About action about experience about I think I think the thing of entering into action actually
 Forces you to take a step of faith as well. Yeah, well there you go. There's our I don't even know how many there's our thoughts
  </li><li>That's random thoughts.
  </li><li>It comes down to how you spend your time.
 Like I get really good at video games
 by spending a lot of time playing video games.
 Like anything I've got good at in life,
 it's because I've spent time on it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You know, I've got a friend right now
 and she's learning all about marketing
 and she's got better at it the more time she's spent
 and it's the same with the Lord.
 You get better at the Lord, that sounds weird,
 but you grow in whatever you aim your time at.
 So, you know, I hope that's encouraging.
 If you want more information on any of that,
 Like dig out, go to our show notes, dig out, we'll put a link to all the episodes that
 we talked about.
 Any other closing thoughts?
 I had just one thought and I think there's more of God to be found in learning to rest
 as well.
 Is that what you learned while spending four months on your back?
 Kind of.
 I'm being facetious.
 But kind of, like, I, because you were saying about spending time doing something and I'm
 I'm thinking the biggest challenge that I have had
 from the Lord for the last, you know,
 year and a half or two years was we really didn't
 used to take a day of rest.
 We didn't really--
  </li><li>Give yourself please.
  </li><li>A full day of rest.
  </li><li>Okay, well, I didn't realize I was coming
 to a Spanish Inquisition right here, but.
  </li><li>Well, okay, I certainly didn't.
 I didn't plan for rest and I didn't really value rest.
 And I would say that's potentially part of how I ended up
 of how I ended up sick, but I now realize I actually rest
 is something that I actually need.
 And out of rest, I am better able to hear.
 So certainly when we've been proactive,
 like I think about a couple of times last year,
 we proactively got away.
 Like we planned long weekends arrest
 and the rejuvenation that brought us was wonderful.
 Yeah, it's great.
 I wonder before we finish talking about this,
 if you would pray for all of our listeners
 for an impartation for more of God, like for a grace to do the things we've been talking about.
 Would you do that? Of course. Okay, go. Father, I just thank you that you are always looking
 to spend time with us. You're always looking to draw us closer to you. And Lord, I ask that you would
 tool us up, God, that you would give us the things that we feel like we're missing in order to be able
 to live in pursuit of you. God, that you'd give us a hunger for the word, that it wouldn't be like
 eating dry toast, but Father that we would find life in your word, or that you would teach us to
 rest, you would teach us to soak, to be able to come to a place of peace and hear from you.
 Lord, I ask you, give us big ears to be able to hear you, to be able to journal and hear back
 from you, God that you put community around us that would support us in our journeys.
 And as we're pressing into you and that Lord, we would have encounters with you.
 But in our dreams, when we're awake, Father, that we would be aware of your presence and
 aware of what you're doing.
 And Lord, I thank you that you are so good and you are writing a beautiful story for each
 one of us.
 Thank you, Father.
 Keep writing.
 We just want to keep saying yes to you and yes to your plan and draw closer to you and look more like Jesus.
 Amen.
 Amen.
