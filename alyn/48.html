<p> AJ Jones. Yes, sir. How are you? I am well. I always think of inappropriate things to say,
 but I'm so proud of my maturity that I never say them. That's a real shocker.
 I have a question for you. How does a week pass and we can't think of anything that we did?
 You can't think of anything that we did? Well, I can think of highlights like the new Star Wars
 trailer that came out. Yes, very excited about the new Star Wars trailer. I can think of the
 the fact that we hosted a birthday party for an eight-year-old.
 Yes.<br/>
 Whereby we, I mean you.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And the site of lots of<br/>
 very generous with your we.<br/>
 I'm pretty sure you left.<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 I left to go to the airport.<br/>
 It's true to pick up some friends of ours.
 It's true.<br/>
 Friends who are sitting in this room.<br/>
 They are friends with exceptional accents.
 Yes.<br/>
 Friends.<br/>
 Would you like to say hello?<br/>
 Hello.<br/>
 Hello.<br/>
 I felt so much pressure in that moment to have an exceptional accent.
</p><ul>
  <li>But you do listen to it.
 You're silky dulcet tones.
  </li><li>Mm, lovely.
  </li><li>I'm not sure they're best displayed by hello.
  </li><li>It's sort of a very elaborate word.
  </li><li>Yes, but as you speak, more of your accent will come out.
 I'll be interested enough of my accent
 de-Americanizes in this episode
 because you're chatting to us.
 Know that the accent police on Twitter will tell me.
  </li><li>I don't have a lot of hope for that, darling,
 because we went back to Scotland for 10 days
 and you came back and you're still as milky white American
 as you ever were.
 milky white, like the milky back kid, he's strong and tough.
 That will only appeal to a certain segment of our podcast audience,
 namely the Brits, but you are British.
 Um, I've seen the other day, the thing we all in this room have in common is
 we all met in Toronto.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 By way of context, Sarah, you met AJ in Toronto.
 I did.
 What year?
 Oh, that's not how I think.
 I don't think in years.
 We met quite a few years ago in Toronto.
 She thinks in clothes.
 Many.
 AJ was wearing pink.
 Maybe 99.
 Yes, probably very close to that.
 99.
 Let's go and say about 15 years ago.
 Yeah.
 And then I met you--
 AJ had very short hair.
 Very.
 You did?
 Spaky.
 Oh.
 I met you in 2003.
 I met you the same time I met AJ.
 Other posts at the time you heard her speak,
 but didn't meet her.
 Well, yeah, I met her.
 Well, I didn't meet her.
 I heard her speak in 2002.
 And then we spoke before I ever spoke to AJ.
  </li><li>Wow, I'm so happy to be the link to AJ here.
 The bridge.
  </li><li>And then Ben, when did you arrive in Toronto?
  </li><li>I came in 2007, March, 2007.
  </li><li>You were late.
  </li><li>Tell everybody what you do in Toronto.
 'Cause you've been there since you arrived.
 That's the other thing we'll have in common.
 We all arrived and never left.
 Well, - Except that we did.
 (all laughing)
  </li><li>And I didn't arrive.
  </li><li>You were born in Toronto.
  </li><li>I was born in Toronto.
  </li><li>Just face it.
 I was a local.
 That isn't a common, but well, I guess we never returned back to our homeland.
 That's true.
 That's what I meant.
 And I'm from Mars, so I'm the same.
 Tell us what you do at Toronto because you all work at the church, formerly known as
 Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship, now known as Catch a Fire Toronto.
 What do you do there?
 Correction.
 It was formerly known as the Toronto Airport Vineyard Christian Fellowship, which then
 became the Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship, which is now known as Catch the Fire.
 I stand corrected.
 Thank you.
 do at the church. Well I work with the School of Ministry as the assistant
 director which means I get to pass to lots of the students and also do lots of
 operational management stuff and generally be involved in the transformation
 that happens there. I am one of five or so ministry directors so I kind of
 oversee a bunch of areas like events and media and communications and all of that
 You're kind of like gifted Ben in terms that you're on the one side a creative genius and on the other side an operational genius.
 Well, you don't normally you usually find people are a one end of that extreme.
 Yeah, and you managed to live in both camps.
 Yeah, on Mark Verkla's test, I was like bang in the middle of left brain, right brain.
 Doesn't surprise.
 He didn't invent that test, but he popularized it.
  </li><li>You should have done circles. - Yeah.
  </li><li>And Sarah, when I first met you,
 you were this intimidating is the wrong word
 'cause there was nothing about you that was intimidating.
 There was nothing that you did that emanated intimidation,
 but you were so confident in who you were,
 so authoritative in what God said about you,
 that you were just this born leader, wouldn't you say, babe?
 Yes, basically all the single men wouldn't dare approach.
 Why don't you think it was just single men?
 But there was that whole other factor.
 But how did you end up like that?
 And is that the way you saw yourself?
 Oh, deep question.
 I...
 I forgot you were a contemplator.
 I should have sent you these questions two weeks.
 So cute.
 I had out the pauses.
 Yes, Ben likes the on the fly ones.
 How did I end up there?
 I think probably the most pivotal moment was going to the School of Ministry.
 That's how I got to Toronto.
 I came to Toronto from England in 1998 to do the school.
 Obviously, I'd grown up with a really fantastic family, Christian family, who, you know, they're
 amazing my parents.
 They are amazing.
 We can all testify to the amazingness of David and Fates.
 Yes, amazing.
 that so they laid a good foundation in and I think coming to do the school just
 kind of opened up my heart, my eyes to who God is and what he said about me and gave me ways to
 live that out practically. I have a question for you. Yes. So you had an amazing upbringing,
 you had great Christian parents, you knew about the love of God. What made you want to come to
 school in Toronto. Because I was really hungry to know God for real for me and
 what I had experienced wasn't enough. Good though it may have been. That
 foundation wasn't perfect. I had loads of emotions in a washing machine around
 inside me which had no clue about. Well at that point I probably wasn't really
 in touch with them to be honest. I in some ways I was I was really
 coming to get tools to help those broken people out there because of course I was so perfect.
 I didn't realize you were one of them. Yes, then, yes, then really that was a pivotal
 moment.
 The other thing that three of us in the room have in common is we all did the same school.
 So we have a shared knowledge of what the school is like and we understand the process
 and of course, age is taught in the school and it's mostly at the school. But for people
 who've never been to the school in Toronto that we love so dearly and of which our school
 was based on, of course. What was the most impacting thing that happened there? Talk to us about
 your journey of transformation. I think from the start, the thing that really stood out to me
 was just the incredible presence of the Holy Spirit that was there, that infuses everything,
 all the core values. I'm hearing God's voice. I mean, that rocked my world. I was like,
 Really, you can ask questions and hear from him and that changes everything.
 That leaves in general when I was ages dummy crying for help.
 It was a little cheesecake in her tummy.
 Something was stepping on a tiny whale.
 I thought there was a little puppy trapped somewhere in a closet.
 Back to Sarah and her incredible revelation of hearing God's voice.
 hearing God's voice, knowing that I could hear from him not in a once in a
 blue moon thing, but as a reality. The Father's love just how he loves me,
 breaking through your shame, all that sort of stuff. I mean, I spent five
 months getting drunk in the Holy Spirit. Was that a new experience for you?
 No, I'd experienced it in the church I came from before I came to Toronto,
 but not as intensely and as frequently. And for people who might not be familiar with
 with the concept of being drunk and the Holy Spirit.
 What does that look like?
  </li><li>That...
  </li><li>What did it look like for you?
  </li><li>What it looked like for me would be just being overwhelmed
 with the presence of God that moves from a state
 of my busy consciousness to a place
 where my whole being feels infused with peace.
 To really where I'm just overwhelmed by his presence
 that I can barely speak, barely stand, I'm laughing,
 and I'm experiencing him in a way that just overwhelms
 all of my senses.
  </li><li>I think the first couple times I saw you,
 you were in that sort of state.
 I remember observing you very intellectually.
 Very interesting.
  </li><li>Would that have been--
  </li><li>She's one of those that responds that way
 to the Holy Spirit.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But you're, for people who don't know you,
 You're a very intelligent, very articulate,
 very organized, very put together.
 You do come from a great home.
 Your life could have looked very, very differently
 if you'd followed a normal English way of graduating
 high school, going to university,
 following a professional career.
 And you were known as your class drunk.
 I mean, for five months, I don't think it's an exaggeration
 to say that as you absorbed the teaching,
 you were paralytic a lot of the time. It's true. So what does that do to somebody who's
 highly intelligent? Or did you not? Were you so overcome with the presence of God that you
 didn't have time to think about or rationalize any of it? Or was it just one big party? I think
 there was probably the beginning was just this, this is a great party, but I think the thing that just
 was revelatory, amazing, knew every day was I am experiencing God and His presence in a real way
 that I've never felt before. And I'm of, I want to experience life, I want to experience
 relationship. And this was finally a tangible way that I was experiencing relationships, seeing
 visions hearing from him laughing sliding down the wall, all those sorts of side things were
 were just a sort of side effect of being in his presence. And I didn't really see the change.
 It was bringing in me until afterwards until in hindsight when I began to see that really the
 very hard heart that I had had was melted by love in those months. When I just thought,
 "What is God doing every time I get in worship? I get in his presence. I just get overwhelmed,
 become almost paralytic. I slide down the wall. I can't stand up." But it kept me immersed
 in love. And it started me on a journey of the places of brokenness inside me being healed,
 met by Jesus instead of kept extremely protected by my walls, my defenses, my...
 No, no, I'm fine. And really just started me into a journey of authentic life.
 It's amazing how good we get at rationalizing our pain away.
 Yes, I have a question. On a scale of one to ten, how thankful are you that video cameras
 didn't exist inside of cell phones during your school.
 Excellent question.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Well, number one, I didn't have a cell phone on my school.
 I mean, this is a...
 I'm just saying if I had had one, I would be more than willing to post video.
 So probably your thankfulness is up there.
 What you're hearing right now is my speechlessness.
 as it all unrolls behind my mind's eye. Yes, 10 being very thankful, deeply thankful,
 knowing that the dear friend that you are and the vigilance with which you would have made those
 videos, I am thankful. I believe we could still probably find a video, not that we will, of when
 you got drunk, well, I'm seeing at a major conference and fell off the front of the stage.
 And flashed everybody.
 And flashed?
 I wasn't going to say that, but yes.
 Do you mean when the guy caught me and almost pulled my top off at that point?
 Yes.
 That was a remarkable moment.
 It was.
 Yeah.
 There's no wonder that Toronto has a terrible reputation.
 At least he caught her.
 She would have been like really hurt, but it wasn't the best of catches.
 We'll come to our reputation in a second.
 But first of all, Benjamin, tell us your story of how you ended up.
 What was life like before?
 And what made you want to come to the school and then what did God do in the school?
 Yeah, okay.
 My life was a lot like Sarah's in the sense that my parents were pastors.
 They were very open to everything that was going on in Toronto.
 I'm really excited about it.
 I decided to come because I felt like I'd kind of reached a bit of a stagnant place in my life.
 And I was like, "Okay, I've got to get away. I need to kind of get refreshed."
 And so I was basically trying to choose between Toronto and I hop at the time and was trying to think,
 "Oh, where do I want to go?"
 And so I was trying to make a decision about that and I thought, "Okay, I'm going to go get my heart healed up,
 enjoy that, and then I'm going to go to I hop."
 But when I came to Toronto, I had no idea that even though I'd been somewhat immersed in,
 you know the values that Toronto carries and and a lot of the Holy Spirit just getting away from my
 family and all of those kind of dynamics that are at play when you live life in a kind of you know
 just everyday routine kind of a way and so I got so wrecked by the Holy Spirit and I got so
 wrecked by the Father's Love that was massive for me. Okay we all understand what that means
 what is that? Trying to explain that to somebody who doesn't understand what it means to be wrecked
 by the father's love because the big challenge that we had when we would minister on the father's
 love people would be like, "Oh, what are you minister on?" We were like, "The father's love."
 And we were like, "Why don't you need to minister on that? Does anyone know that God loves them?"
 So you obviously knew that God loved you. What's the missing link between
 you know that God loves you and you got wrecked and the father's love? I help explain that.
 Yeah, I mean, it's totally the difference of a heart and head journey, isn't it?
 it like I'd in my head I'd kind of known. Yeah, the father loves me, loves me unconditionally,
 salvation is a gift and all of that kind of thing. But I think when I'd kind of started
 to get immersed into his presence, there was nothing I could feel except that love and
 accept that unconditional love. And I think what I mean by rect is it wrecks your perception
 of everything. It wrecks my perception of my worth. It wrecks my perception of what
 I'm going to do with my life, because no longer do I need to prove anything. It wrecks my
 ability to even relate to people the way I had before, because you also in the process
 you often start to get an understanding of how God also loves those other people. So
 it's just totally sabotages your whole model for life. And yeah, it's just a weeping mess
 on the floor for a few days and for a few months. And we met on your show because we
 taught on your show. Is that right? Yeah. And then we met you and thought you'd be perfect
 for Sarah. Thank you for setting that up. I appreciate it. You're welcome. I'm not sure
 how much we had in setting it up. We just asked pointed questions. Well, as you kind
 of said earlier, Sarah was in this role where she is incredibly capable, a leader, a teacher,
 but she's also like hot.
 And for me, it's like a single male.
 I was just like, what are you trying to do to me?
  </li><li>It was one of the like wonders of the world,
 how she was still single.
  </li><li>It wasn't an enigma.
 Oh, and all the guys on the school would talk about it.
 Like in a very honoring way, just like.
  </li><li>What everybody was-- - What is this?
  </li><li>But everybody was too scared to go near her.
 There was this force field.
 And I alluded to earlier, and there was,
 of course, the force field of, you're not worthy.
 All men, but there was also the force field that nothing to do with or attractiveness just her authority and car.
 How was it that you managed to bypass the force field that surrounded Sarah?
 Like why were you not intimidated? Like from the outside of doing like you were intimidated at all.
 I was asked to be a small group leader after my school,
 which is where they take on some interns to kind of help lead the next batch of students.
 And so in the process I was in the office with Sarah every day.
 And so that kind of attractiveness thing really did start to ensnare me, as it were.
 And I was thinking, man, why is it that she's single?
 I just don't get this.
 And we got on great.
 And I think I managed to make her laugh.
 And I was like, wow, she's really fun.
 She's, you know, an amazing woman.
 And I wasn't really thinking much more beyond that because she felt totally out of reach.
 But I had a few friends who were already married, including you guys,
 that when I kind of implied that I might be interested, they were like,
 "You should totally go for it." And I was like, "For real?
 You think I actually stand a chance?"
 I remember this one conversation with a friend who didn't want to say, "Ask her out."
 But he's kind of like, "You know, Ben, unless you shoot for the stars,
 you're never really going to hit anything."
 And I just feel like you could be setting your sights too low.
 and there might be one particular star that feels out of reach,
 but you should really try.
 It was very subtle of love, really.
 I remember the first time I knew who you were,
 because I'd already heard your name from no one in particular,
 but you might be sitting next to you.
 And it was like a Friday morning thing,
 and I think I was there to teach,
 but you were dancing 'cause they were doing
 like a rave worship thing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I was like, wow, that guy can really dance.
 And so I went in the office and I was like,
 Sarah, you love dancing.
 You know, one of those guys can really dance
 and she's like, I already know who it is.
 You know, kind of thinking I was like, huh.
  </li><li>Had you already been out to worship
 and then hobbled back into your cave of an office
 so you weren't caused to stumble by a nice
 since you dance moves?
  </li><li>I think that might have been it.
  </li><li>It's probably.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Moving on from central dance.
 (laughing)
 And rave worship.
  </li><li>But rave isn't the right word.
  </li><li>Let's talk about the controversies
 of revival at Toronto.
 I remember once,
 Agee and I were teaching on a school in Toronto,
 and there was a young man from South Africa
 that in the middle of us sharing just howled,
 just screamed, just this core pain,
 scream, wail, got up and ran out.
 We were like, well, we keep teaching.
 And at the break, we spoke to him and he said,
 you know, and I thought he summed this up brilliantly.
 He said, "I came to Toronto because I wanted the signs, the wonders, the power."
 But when I got here, all I found was the love of God.
 And I thought I'd made a mistake, but now I realize I completely missed the point of
 revival.
 And I thought that is one end of the spectrum.
 Like some people mistake the revival in Toronto, and there are signs and there are wonders,
 and there's incredible displays of God's power.
 but it's all rooted in the father's love.
 That's one end of the spectrum.
 The other end of the spectrum is it's all demonic.
 Talk to me about some of the biggest misconceptions
 you've seen or heard about the revival in Toronto.
  </li><li>So you're looking at me because my stomach's still making
 little tiny noises.
  </li><li>I mean, like you say, people often kind of think
 about the Toronto and it's the manifestations
 that catch people's attention.
 People even now say to me, and you know,
 we're 21 years on or whatever,
 people often say, "So do people still bark like dogs?" and all of that kind of thing.
 And I can say safely, in eight years of me being there, I've actually never seen anyone
 bark like dogs.
 I've seen plenty of people rolling around on the floor.
 But the way that John Arnaput's that he says, "It's a wonder that a power of God can hit
 you and you're still alive."
 Right.
 Right.
 It's not surprising that you react to it.
 It's surprising that you live through it.
 Right.
 Whether it's rolling on the floor, shaking or whatever.
 Yeah.
 And so I think people often kind of want to target that and you just think that is like the least, that is the smallest part of it.
 It's the smallest facet of what God's really doing.
 And it's really just like, I don't know, like a little ripple on the surface.
 When you throw a rock into a lake, you might see a ripple on the surface.
 But underneath there's a whole lot of water moving and there's a whole lot of stuff going on.
 I think that's one of the unfortunate things is that people only see what's on the surface.
 I mean, there's so many things that there was controversy about in the beginning.
 I think one of the things that really stood out to me was the number of people that I
 prayed for when I was part of the ministry team who would just be laughing and laughing.
 And they would laugh out loud for a good 25 minutes.
 long, it's hard to sustain that sort of laughter naturally. And afterwards, when I'd asked them
 what was going on, people would say things like, "I have just had this bitterness and this hatred
 or this grief that I've carried for 20 years. And as God touched me, I just laughed and laughed,
 and that thing is gone. That place of pain, that place of anger." And just sing, sing
 Someone being touched so visibly, but seeing that God was doing things really deep under their surface
 was a phenomenal thing to see.
 Do you guys have any favorite stories of miracles that you've seen, be that changed lives,
 like the story you were just talking about there, Sarah, or signs and wonders, or miracles
 that stood out to you in your years in Toronto that you were like, God, I mean, God, you keep
 amazing me. There's there's been loads of healing miracles and often at conferences,
 you know, people are getting healed of the most incredible, like painful things that have affected
 them for years and years and years. But often the things that get me most excited are kind of emotional
 baggage and bondage and like pain that is so deeply affected someone's identity in their entire
 perspective of life. And over the course of a few months in Toronto, like they shift,
 they change and they visibly change. And you know, whether that's eating disorders or
 demonic stuff or like there's so many things where people have just incredibly changed.
 And that's what excites me the most. I can't necessarily think of a particular story though.
 That's awesome.
 There's so many.
 It's hard to put your finger on one.
 I mean, one of the ones recently that's probably most dear to my heart is a girl who came
 actually onto our school and she, the first three months, she was anorexic.
 She was, you know, she would just wear these huge black hoodies.
 She would stand in worship with her arms crossed, just angry.
 wouldn't really speak to people, wouldn't speak in small group, was just resisting everything
 that was happening. And one morning she just has this moment of every morning she would
 refuse to worship because she was just like, "No, I don't feel these things, I don't think
 this." And she just has this like God thought where this just, "I've said no to him every
 day. What will happen if I say yes?" And then so she just decides like, "Well, I'll say
 yes to you." And in that moment she just gets overwhelmed by the Holy Spirit. She falls
 to her knees, starts weeping and weeping, starts repenting. You know, she has this revelation
 that really the anorexia was rebellion against God. She weeps and she has thick, thick hair.
 to go and blow dry her hair after this encounter with Holy Spirit with God. And the next morning,
 when she woke up, she said it was the first morning in years and years, when she'd woken up,
 her first thought had not been, "Oh, I wish I was dead." And she was just like, "I woke up and I
 felt good." And then later that afternoon, she was going to homeless shelter with a group of people.
 And the next morning she comes in she's like i ordered a latte and i didn't even think about it and the sort of grip of anorexia that have been on her life was totally gone.
 Well the next weeks and months.
 Is she she was just so which is just like to lie down listen to.
 You know, music, sitting God's presence, she just got visibly transformed into this thriving,
 life-filled girl, just phenomenal.
 Wow.
 I love that.
 I love that.
 Everything, everything worth it.
 We've all had our lives changed by Toronto, by what God's doing in Toronto.
 It's incredible.
 Tell people how they can find more information about your school, which we heartily endorse.
 I mean, we love your school changed my life completely.
 I wouldn't have met AJ.
 Yeah, I was going to change my life too, because I ended up moving on.
 I had some Scotsman as a result, but it is incredible.
 Like I don't know an epicenter of healing quite like Toronto.
 I just the culture, the environment, the whole place saturated and years of revival.
 It's incredible.
 So if someone's listened to this and they want to come to the school of ministry in Toronto,
 what do they do next?
 Go onto our website, SOMtoronto.com.
 I will put a link in the show notes.
 As we wrap up, the reason Sarah is here this week is she's teaching on our school on dream
 interpretation.
 So there's a gifted teacher, gifted dream interpreter.
 And I've asked her if she would have a go in interpreting your dreams.
 So if you are listening and you have had a dream that perhaps is a repetitive dream or
 you've had a dream recently, we're just thinking, I wonder if God's speaking to me this.
 Do as a favor, go to allenandaj.com/dreams, fill in the form there, send us the dream.
 And next week on next week's episode, Sarah is going to interpret dreams from our listeners
 and answer questions about dream interpretation.
 But guys, as we wrap up, what I would love is if you two would pray and bless our listeners
 with a revelation of the Father's love.
 All right, well, heavenly Father, we just thank you so much that you and your arms can reach people all over the world, wherever these listeners are, and Lord, we just ask that you would come.
 Right now, and in people's homes or in their cars, wherever they are, that Lord you would come and encounter them with your love, that they would be radically changed from the inside out, just as they experienced the tangible presence of your love.
 Dad, your love changes everything.
 It brings peace to our hearts.
 It brings rest from fear, from anxiety.
 Your love changes the very course of our lives.
 And Father, for those people right now who are struggling with anxiety and fear,
 would your love come in like a wave and just kick that fear right out of their lives,
 of their hearts, Father, where anxieties had a place in their bodies, would you come
 and bring incredible freedom and just an overwhelming sense of security into their hearts?
 Dad, we invite you to come and root and ground every person who's listening in love that
 is deeper and wider than anything they've ever known before.
 Thank you, Dad.
 Amen.
 Well, lovely listeners.
 We are so glad to join us and remember to send in your dreams to be interpreted or your
 questions for next week otherwise, we shall see you a non!
