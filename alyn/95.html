<p> Hello dear listener, I'm sorry I know you are probably expecting Jesse's wonderful jingle right now, but I wanted to hop on before the show began and say for whatever reason we had some technical issues with this episode and unfortunately the sound quality is way below what we would consider good or even okay.
 but we had so much fun recording this episode and ages at the movie theater so we couldn't
 re-record the episode. So you'll forgive us, you'll notice some crackles and pops, you probably can
 even hear it just now. It doesn't happen all the way through, but I've hit my ceiling of knowing
 why it's happening. But rest assured we've got some calls in with our hardware and our software
 providers and we're going to work hard to get back to the standard that we love at recording for you
 guys. So enjoy the show, I just wanted to let you know we're aware that some crackles were working
 hard on it. And here's Jesse.<br/>
 I'll in an a. J's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Jones.
</p><ol>
  <li>J Jones. Hello there. How was your week?
 It was a great week without thinking too hard. What was the highlight of your week?
 You speaking on Monday night?
 I was not expecting that. I wasn't sure what the right answer was.
 So I just thought I would pick something that you did really well and go with that.
 Okay, but the speaker this morning told me to encourage someone.
 Who was this week of this morning?
 You. And so I'm encouraging you.
 All right. You're very sweet, but seriously, what was the highlight of your week?
 I think probably all the friend time that we had this week.
 Yeah. We had relational highs this week.
 Yeah. We had great joy-filled meetings.
 Do you think it's because our schedule is a little lower that we have more energy?
 Yes.
 So you think that because normally we're teaching so much that we use up a lot of our
 connecting, influencing, extrovert time, and then we have none left over?
 Yes, even for each other. I love you, good night.
 Good night.
 Grum.
 Yeah, we did. We had lots of joyful meetings.
 I also think probably we have more energy because we're doing this anti-inflammatory diet thing.
 Do you want to talk about the anti-inflammatory diet?
 Yes.
 It's not in our show notes.
 It isn't.
 Why don't we wait till next week till we're finished this anti-inflammatory diet?
 Okay, and then we can talk about it.
 And then we'll talk all about it.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 And we'll have more information about results and such.
 Okay, so that's what we're going to do next week.
 We'll talk about that.
 Okay.
 You were right.
 Monday night, I did speak on what are we saved for.
 I'm doing this series called the foundations of our faith. The week before last, I talked about
 what do we save from, then this week I taught on what do we saved for, and then tomorrow I'm going
 to teach on how are we saved? Oh, good. And so if you're not calm, oh, good. If you're new to the
 Christian faith, or even if you've been saved for a long time, it's so important that we understand
 the basics, the foundations as it were of our faith. And so that's what I'm having
 tremendous fun teaching. And then as you said, we had lots and lots and lots and lots of
 spare energy for relational time. So we've had people over the house, we've grilled out,
 we went and celebrated birthdays. Yeah, it was a great week, great relational week.
 If you had to guess what the highlight of my week was, what would you say it was?
 Test driving a Tesla for fun. Yeah. So we have an electric car, we drive around
 in Nissan Leaf, which is a fully electric car, no gasoline or petrol for our European listeners.
 and we just charge up at home and the last time john carrow here john love the electric car and
 was interested them but went home and ended up purchasing a tesla.
 Which is seriously advanced.
 Yeah it's in a different price bracket and a different vehicle altogether but he called us
 and if you guys love to leave you totally love the tesla and we were like yeah we're probably
 going to sell a bunch more books before we can get a tesla but we were intrigued so we went
 just for fun test drove a Tesla. Were you ready for what happened?
 I was not. So we drove one of the cars that are equipped with ludicrous mode.
 Yes. I thought that was marketing speak. No, it is actually ludicrous.
 And so ludicrous mode is where they, I don't know what they do, but they do some sort of magic.
 Supercharged something. Yeah.
 Make you, I forget this official specs, zero to 60 in 2.8 seconds or something.
 a blink of an eye. And that was cool. But I think the coolest thing was the automated autopilot.
 Don't talk about that. We've got some great video of you freaking out.
 Well, it's pretty freaky. If you turn on the autopilot, it keeps the car within the lane
 that you're in. And if while autopilot is on, you turn on your signal, it will change lanes
 and then stop only, you know, only changing one lane.
 But I mean, in autopilot, it'll go around corners and stuff.
 If your lane goes around a corner.
 Yeah.
 And I should note that it doesn't just randomly change lanes.
 It checks to make sure there's no vehicles in the way.
 Yeah.
 I mean, it's a fully autopilot.
 It is so bizarre.
 You can literally let go of the steering wheel and the thing drives.
 It is like a gift from the future.
 Yeah.
 But I kept thinking, gosh, if this becomes normal technology,
 How are you going to stop people from texting?
 Well, if this becomes normal technology, I would imagine accidents and collisions
 are going to go way down because there's a computer constantly paying attention
 rather than a distracted human being.
 Well, yeah, that's possible to.
 Yeah, because it senses the cars in front of you and slows down and all that kind of stuff.
 Do you like my never ending trust in future technology?
 I do.
 I'm probably the person that's enabling Skynet to terminate a reference.
 Oh, right.
 But I loved it.
 It was great.
 The guy was not sleazy or slimy as a salesman.
 We just had a good time.
 No, he was a lovely guy.
 Yeah, really good.
 And he clearly enjoyed talking about the car.
 It is a fantastic car.
 Yeah.
 So could you write some more books, please?
 That would be awesome.
 Sure.
 I'll get right on that.
 Thank you very much.
 And then today you spoke.
 I did.
 Well, I speak on cigars.
 Yes, cigars.
 That's what you spoke on.
 You spoke on dealing with discouragement.
 Mm-hmm.
 I did.
 Yeah.
 It was very good.
 And your slides were very good.
 Well, one of the highlights for me was somebody at the end of the first
 server came up to me and was like, Hey, I'm a visitor.
 You know, I really enjoyed your slides.
 Um, I could tell you must be an apple nerd.
 I work for Apple.
 And I thought you'd do.
 And he said, yeah, I'm one of the things I do is I'm a keynote expert.
 And so did you know about this feature, this feature in this feature?
 And I was like, I did not.
 And I would get myself as a keynote expert.
 I use keynote almost every single day, but he managed to show me, uh,
 one feature that I didn't even know existed.
 I thought that is very, very cool.
  <ul>
    <li>Well, what is it?
    </li><li>Well, for $29.99, I will show you.
    </li><li>Oh, okay.
    </li><li>Or kisses, either way.
    </li><li>Okay, kisses, perfect.
 Hey, we also forgot to mention the tea.
    </li><li>Oh, let's talk about tea right now.
    </li><li>Yes, so we have found a tea
 that we both really, really enjoy.
    </li><li>And for contact.
 You like coffee, I don't like coffee.
 I love the smell of it, but I've never enjoyed the taste of it.
 And I don't drink tea.
 And by tea for our British listeners,
 you know what tea is, builder's tea, breakfast tea,
 whatever, I just never enjoyed hot drinks.
    </li><li>Right.
    </li><li>But maybe it's because we've been on this
 anti-inflammatory diet that I've been bored of,
 what I've been drinking so venture out.
 But we found this chai tea at Starbucks.
 It's a tea vanna, Oprah chai.
    </li><li>Yeah.
 And then we...
    </li><li>And this is really nice.
    </li><li>We were out on a date because we had friends over
 that were giving us free babysitting
 while they did their laundry.
 and so we were out wandering around and I've been carrying birthday money since November,
 just on the off chance that I might see something I wanted.
 And we walked into the T-van, I think, and they had like a gift set thing with the T-vanity.
 Well, we just went and said, "Hey, are you the people that make the Oprah Chai for Starwatch?"
 Yes, we are.
 And we're like, could you sell us some?
 And then we found out how expensive tea is.
 Yeah, crazy expensive.
 So we just shoplifted the end of the story.
 Oh, that's not exactly what happened, but okay.
 They're even close to what happened.
 (laughs)
 So they told us the cost of tea,
 and we were like, are you kidding me right now?
 Right, we're like, we'll have two ounces of tea, please.
 (laughs)
 No, they basically had a set left over from Christmas,
 didn't they?
 And she kind of ran the numbers going,
 Actually, if you buy the set, it's the same price as buying the tea, but you're going to get a tea maker plus some nice,
 bottom glass glasses.
 Right.
 And so we've been having tea every day.
 Yeah.
 I feel, I don't know what I feel like very sophisticated.
 I've sophisticated.
 So ridiculous.
 But it's a delicious tea.
 It's so yummy.
 I get excited about beverages.
 So if you come to our house, we will make you fruit fruit tea or one of Asia's coffees.
 Yes.
 Is that the story you want to tell?
 I wasn't sure what you're going with.
 I just, I was excited that we have this tea as a story.
 It's not particularly great one, isn't it?
 No, but if you are a tea drinker, you might get excited about our story.
 OK, if you are a tea drinker, a loose leaf tea, please recommend teas.
 We should try because we don't know what to do.
 I was thinking of picking up the sampler kit.
 Yeah, it's like a whole new world now.
 Mm hmm.
 Yeah.
 So we, we advice tea advice.
 I just heard myself outside of myself.
 good lord have boring if we become.
 Well, we're officially in our 40 starting or talking about tea and the podcast.
 I think tea.
 All right.
 Let's very, very quickly move on to our topic of the week.
 Okay.
 Perhaps it's because we've been so highly relational or perhaps it's been because of all the studying I've been doing about joy and purposeful relationships.
 I actually want to talk about relationships tonight.
 Okay.
 Sounds good.
 I got some questions for us to answer.
 I've written down questions. I don't know the answers. We'll see where they go.
 And this also comes from a lot of the feedback that we got from you guys last week, a bunch of
 you sent in, you know, the challenges you're facing. So I wanted to talk about relationships.
 Okay. I wanted to start with this question because we've probably all been there.
 And this is the scenario I'm talking about that you meet somebody and you think I would love to
 be in relationship with that person, but I'm not currently in relationship with that person.
 And I don't know how I can get in relationship with that person.
 What are some of the advice that we could give people?
 Because right now, present day, we've got relationships with people that previously
 we either didn't know or we knew of through different avenue, perhaps our authors of books,
 or perhaps we've heard them at conferences or an mmm is that how God's crossed our path together.
 But what advice can you give for people who are wanting to be in relationship with other
 other people, but aren't in relationship with those people.
 And by relationships, I'm talking friendships.
 I'm not talking about romantic ones.
    </li><li>Are we assuming that the other people
 want to be in relationship back?
    </li><li>No, we're talking about, we don't even know.
 You just, everybody does that.
 You meet somebody by chance, maybe on vacation,
 or you meet somebody at work, or you meet somebody at church,
 or what would be some of the advice you could give?
    </li><li>Well, so you meet people at church,
 or somewhere that you are and you think,
 "Oh, you know, I'd like to get to know them
 and see if maybe there's a friendship there."
 I think I'm going to stop you right there.
 Yeah.
 Because I think 90% of the population doesn't think like that.
 What do you mean?
 Well, what you just said is exactly how it answered that question.
 So you meet somebody, you bump into somebody and you're like, man, I would
 love to have a relationship with that.
 I think most people stop at that thought, I would love to have a relationship
 with that person, but then never think that that's possible.
 But then how do you get any new friends?
 Well, that's why we get questions all the time about that.
 Right.
 It's because people want but are too frightened to risk rejection.
 So don't reach out.
 Right.
 So I guess for one of a better term,
 I would say take them out for a test drive.
 You know what I mean?
 Like just sort of something light and fluffy.
 I don't--
 I'm so creepy.
 I know.
 I know.
 Find a different phrase.
 But you know what I mean?
 Like sort of something light and fluffy,
 a go to a restaurant that's fun or a coffee or whatever.
 And just chat and see, do we have anything that's actually
 going to be the basis of a relationship?
 Or are you just a really cold person,
 but we probably aren't going to connect very well?
 Right.
 'Cause we've had our fair share of those
 where we meet somebody and our version of them,
 of what we think they're gonna be like,
 you know, that we've entirely constructed in our head
 thinking, oh my gosh.
    </li><li>'Cause you don't know them.
    </li><li>Yeah.
    </li><li>I've heard your story, I've heard you preach
 or I've seen you here or there
 or we have a mutual friend and you connect
 and you're just like,
 "Ah, I totally misread that situation.
 "There's no life on this relationship."
 I think the key though is being intentional.
 I just find so many people are passive in their wants,
 but don't put anything into action.
    </li><li>Yeah.
    </li><li>So one of my favorite phrases is, in a perfect world,
 like if I could design this, this is what I would love.
 And I've learned over the years that that's a valuable thing.
 You might not feel the same way,
 but at least I can pitch it to you
 and until I pitch it to you, I have no idea.
    </li><li>Right, and the advantage of clear communication
 is you don't have any ickiness afterwards,
 like a date gone bad.
 But sometimes I wonder if I come across as a freak.
    </li><li>Sometimes you do.
 (laughs)
    </li><li>Thanks for breaking that to me, Jan.
    </li><li>Sorry, darling.
 Oh, did you want me to tell you in private first?
    </li><li>No, I think that in a world where we are so often
 nervous about who we are and what we want and what we think,
 it is a little bit alarming to find people who just
 communicate exactly what they're thinking
 and how they're feeling.
    </li><li>Yes.
    </li><li>But I find that super refreshing.
 I find it so easy.
    </li><li>Yes.
 example. I remember years and years and years ago before we'd ever moved to Franklin proper.
 We came and our now good friend, Shannon Macleard, walked up to you in a moment which I thought
 was sheer horror and just said out loud to you. If you moved here, we'd be best friends.
 Now, maybe she was being prophetic, but maybe she was just being socially.
 Well, she is very prophetic, but it was felt like, oh, okay.
 Okay. So that's what I mean. That was like a weird, I think I was taken aback by like,
 "Ah, what is behind that?" And I'm sure she went away thinking, "What was I talking about?"
 But also because we had that kind of a thing in other countries, you know, where it was like,
 "Oh, wow, you're so strange." Right. And now, you know what I mean? But it turns out she was right.
 Right. Do you think we have a relationship with her because she walked up and said that to you,
 or was there other things that she did that fostered relationship?
 Well, I think she not only said that, but then when we moved here, she did pursue relationship.
 And we hit it off.
 Our personalities are quite similar.
 We're quite blunt individuals and just say things as they are or whatever.
 And it's great because neither one of us have to filter for the other one.
 So it's an easy relationship.
 So I think once we did move here and start hanging out, it was like, "Oh yeah, you're
 right.
 We're going to be good friends."
 I heard somebody once saying, "I'm not sure if I fully understand or believe the extent
 of the statement."
 But basically the premise was you attract the level of health that you currently have.
 Not talking physical health, but emotional, relational health.
 So one of the best things you can do to grow in your relationships is growing your own
 personal development.
 Yes.
 and communication styles and all that kind of stuff.
 Right, because I'm attracted.
 We should probably talk about the gift of attraction.
 Like, again, we're not talking about romantic relationships here.
 We're talking about a gift of attraction where you meet somebody
 and you are attracted again, not sexually or romantically,
 but there's something about that person's life that is life giving.
 Yeah. And you're attracted to it.
 Yeah. Like a bug to a light.
 Right, but there is something where you're just like, "Ah, either that person, I love the way that person treats their kids."
 Or, "I love the way that person manages themselves in conflict."
 Or how they get lost in worship.
 Or whatever the thing is that highlights them to you.
 How fruitful their marriage is.
 Or they seem to have a neck for business.
 Or whatever it is that the Lord is doing in your heart.
 When you see that on somebody else, there's an attraction.
 Yeah.
 And I've found that when you move towards that attraction, if it's reciprocated,
 then pursue that relationship.
 Yeah, sure.
 You know, kind of like favor dictate where you're at.
 Yeah.
 And then the other thing is, is if you do have that kind of attraction to getting to know
 somebody and it isn't reciprocated, not to be offended and to just be able to bless
 them and move on.
 Totally, totally.
 You know, because the truth is you don't have to be friends with everybody.
 Exactly.
 And you can't be friends with everybody.
 And that's a hard truth for some people to understand is that I think really powerful
 people, the people that we've grown to really respect are great stewards of not only their
 time, but their relationships and their emotional levels of connection.
 So it's kind of like that.
 If I say yes to more connection, I'm going to degrade the ones I currently have.
 So I think part of growing into better relationships is stewarding the ones you currently have.
 different levels of relationships require different levels of energy or different levels
 of input.
 Right.
 I don't know if this is going to come across well because we haven't fully fleshed out
 this teaching.
 But I think in about when we did a teaching on relationship audits, and I was thinking
 about there's three spheres of relationships.
 We need to find better terminology for these.
 But there's relationships that you and I have with other people and it's mutually life-giving.
 When we see them, it is not hard work.
 It is life-giving.
 There's this just mutual flow, black and forth of life and of energy.
 And they're the type of friends you have and you come over and you're still in your pajamas
 and it's not awkward.
 Yeah, it doesn't matter what your house looks like or what your kids are doing.
 burdens aren't a burden to you and vice versa. You're just doing life together and it's easy.
 And those are rare. Yes. They're rare to find and they're treasures to find and
 we've been blessed with a couple of those relationships all through our life. I'm very grateful for them.
 Then there's another type of relationship which is just as valuable but basically you're in
 relationship and I don't even know how you quantify this but it seems like you're in a
 relationship where you are getting more quote unquote benefit from the relationship than
 they necessarily are. And this is where you get tricky. For example, when we lived with John and
 Carol, we were totally the benefactors. We were totally the benefactors of that relationship.
 I'm not saying that it was one sided and they didn't enjoy being friends with us, but
 I'm just saying they were finding life outside of our relationship, of course. But the benefits of
 of being in relationship with John and Carol, and that's such a crass way of saying that.
 I mean, we were mentored by them, we grew under them, we were pasted by them, we were
 cared for them, they would nurture us, they would, you know, their stage of life versus
 our stage of life meant they were doing more of the giving and we were doing more of the receipt.
 Right.
 You know, for example, birthdays, their disposable income to bless us on our birthdays was far
 greater than all disposable income to bless them.
 I'm like, oh, we could get a $25 gift card.
 And they're like, here's an apple iPhone.
 Yeah, exactly.
 And so there's that lopsidedness,
 but it doesn't mean there isn't life in it.
 Right. Yeah, there's still life.
 It's just one is receiving maybe a bit more.
 And then the flip side of that is the third type
 of relationships we find ourselves in.
 Where it's reversed,
 we're the people that we're in relationship
 with are slightly greater benefactors than we are.
 And again, it's not that we're not getting anything
 at the relationship far from it.
    </li><li>Right, but you're intentionally pouring into those people.
    </li><li>Exactly, that's a really good way of doing it.
 There's still life in it.
 You see this in the Bible all the time,
 like so Paul and Timothy, for example.
 It's not that Paul and Timothy had a terrible relationship
 and it was just some sort of mentorship program,
 but there were elements of that.
 Paul genuinely loved Timothy.
 Timothy really benefited from having Paul in his life,
 but there was a greater flow
 flowing from Paul to Timothy than vice versa.
    </li><li>Right, Paul is like the wisdom resource
    </li><li>Right, for Timothy, yeah.
    </li><li>Jesus and the disciples, for example.
    </li><li>Sure.
    </li><li>It's not like Jesus is like,
 that's a great point,
 I received great revelation from you today.
 But there was life on Jesus,
 or you wouldn't pick the,
 and even in Jesus' relationships,
 you see the 72, the 12, and the three.
    </li><li>Yes.
    </li><li>He had varying degrees of interpersonal relationships
 with the people that he was friends with.
    </li><li>Or intimacy, right?
    </li><li>Yeah. - Yeah.
    </li><li>So we from time to time take a step back,
 And there's got to be life in your relationship,
 so it's not worth doing it.
    </li><li>Yeah, and even to quantify that helps in terms of
 being able to allocate time and resources.
    </li><li>Right.
    </li><li>You know, in terms of, okay, what am I doing here?
 Okay, I can recognize this is a relationship
 that I'm pouring into.
    </li><li>Right.
    </li><li>And I want to pour into this person
 and I enjoy this person.
 And so I'm gonna make sure that that person
 is aware of my affection and my intention.
    </li><li>Right.
 And then, okay, who are people that are just playing life to us?
 We need to make sure that they're on the grid because we're not taking them for
 granted.
 Yeah.
 Because it's so easy.
 Yeah.
 Do you think we're just so high in the shape or life language that maybe other
 people don't think like this about relationships?
 I have no idea.
 It's just the only way we can interview a responder.
 It's true though.
 Like I think we probably do relationships more intentionally.
 Well, I think you should qualify that.
 I think we do more do relationships more intentionally the way we view life than other
 people.
 But I think other life languages would say they're just as intentional.
 But for example, we schedule out time to be in relationship with the people we're in
 relationship with.
 So I've got time that I meet with the people that I'm either sewing into or they're sewing
 into me or there's mutual it.
 on the calendar because I've found that if it's not, it doesn't happen.
 Right.
 And then, but then in addition, those people take priority over other things that come
 up.
 That's right, true.
 I don't know how other people do relationship.
 That's, that's a funny, I don't know.
 I've never thought about it.
 I don't know if that's normal or not.
 And then to throw a spanner in the works, you have relationships as it don't fit in any
 of that structuredness because if you think about like two of our closest friends, Gary
 Sarah Morgan live on the other side of the world with a 14-hour time difference.
 Well, yeah.
 Is it more than 14 hours?
 Yeah, it's like 17 or something.
 17, right?
 But that's where FaceTime and messages come in.
 And we were so blessed that they decided to come over, which I just loved that.
 They were just like, "We haven't seen you forever. We're getting on playing coming over."
 So I don't know. I feel like we're exploring this and we don't have language for it.
 And so forgive us if anything we've said sounds crass or this is us verbally processing, I think,
 about relationships rather than having a fully thought out schematic.
 We'll see how the feedback goes on this.
 Maybe we shouldn't verbally process about things on the air.
 Lastly, because you're going to a movie tonight.
 I am.
 I'm leaving for a movie.
 Talk about some of the relationship killers that are just death to relationships that took
 you a while to work out is death.
 I think while there's probably your obvious things like jealousy,
 you know, that would definitely be a relationship killer.
 I don't know, I'm trying to.
 We're talking about it downstairs and now I've forgotten what we were saying.
 Danny Silk does a great job on his book, Keep Your Love On, where we
 are exhibiting behaviors or communication styles which are actually
 degrading the connections that we have. And again, this is where the whole topic
 of powerful communication comes on. If I'm constantly degrading our connection but have no clue I'm
 doing it, I need feedback from you in a loving way. Is it a hate actually Al? Can I just give you?
 I mean, I remember one of my oldest friends and most consistent friends, in fact, we're going to
 be spending summer with Glenn and Anna who I've known them since I've known Anna since I was a
 teenager. I've known Glenn since I was about 18 or 19. I forget whenever our first year in
 university. And we're still friends to this day. Of course, it's look different because we live in
 the opposite world. But there are people I treasure greatly. We've got a long history together. And I
 remember when I lived in Edinburgh, I remember Glenn having a conversation with me, which was
 brilliant. He just said, Hey, we're friends. But often it feels like I get the tail end of your
 availability. And so could we redefine how we do relationship? And that conversation was so
 fantastic. It was so ahead of its time for my understanding of brave communication. But he
 brought a structure and a definition to our relationship that totally changed my life and
 changed the way we think. So a relationship killer then would be being unwilling to confront with
 the small C things that are degrading the connection. He used to ask me eight questions every week.
 I used to ask him eight questions. Well, one of the questions was, "Have you spoken badly about me
 behind my back, because that would be a relationship killer.
 But hopefully you're not in relationship with people you're speaking badly about, because
 that seems...
 That would be strange.
 I think the opposite of the whole thing of relationship killers are the relationship
 growers.
 So, like one of the obvious things, we've already talked about it being shapers, being
 intentional with our time and planning things.
 That was one of the things that I've just mentioned and glended for me, just saying,
 "Hey, if this relationship is valuable, let's make it valuable and let's set aside time
 to have value to it.
 Yeah, no, I totally agree.
 And then I think the other thing to be aware of is that relationships change as the seasons
 of life change.
 And I think that's a shock to some people that like can't have the same relationship
 for the rest of your life.
 Well, people I was in relationships now live in the other side of the world for me.
 There's no expectation that it can be the same.
 It can still have value, but it will just shift differently.
 All right.
 Well, forgive our wild ramblings as we have been pondering out loud this whole topic of
 relationships.
 We'd love to hear your perspectives.

 Baby, we announced the more conference this morning.
 Do you want to tell us about it?
 I'm so excited about the more conference.
 We have Danny Silk coming and Chris McLarnie is leading worship, which Chris is obviously
 a personal friend, but he's just such an anointed worship leader.
 So we're super stoked.
 I've never heard Danny Silk lie. You haven't? Not live. So I'm pretty stoked about that too.
 Yeah, we're excited to have Bethel and Jesus culture at Grace Center and the dates are May
 20th and 21st. And if you would like tickets for that, go to gracecenter.us/more.
 And the first hundred tickets is half price.
 Yep. All right. Well, we are done. We hope that you have a relationally full week this week,
 and we will be back here same time same place next week. Have a good week.
 Faith, life, communication, tacos and video games
 Pale you donuts and the kindness of God
 But things we deal with every day
 From Franklin, Tennessee
 They are just like you and me
 Alan, and AJ
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 Sharing their life, experience it
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 They talk about faith in God and everything under the sun
 If you are a human being, there's something here for everyone
