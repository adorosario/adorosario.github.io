<p> "I live in AJ's podcast for your Monday, most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses."
 Well, welcome to another episode of Keeping Up With Joneses, though this week you're
 only keeping up with one of them.<br/>
 Because the other one, the one who's not interrupting me with Yoda impersonations, is currently
 in bed recovering from surgery she unexpectedly had this week.
 A story will no doubt tell next week when she's all better.
 fear not because we have a fantastic episode for you. And the Canadian quota is still strong,
 even though AJ is not here, our special guest who I'll introduce in a second is Canadian,
 so all is okay in the universe. Now, normally at this point in the podcast, we update you on
 our week, but honestly, our week pretty much got hijacked when I had to take AJTER at midnight on
 Tuesday because she was in agony. But again, I don't want to tell that story until she's here.
 So how about some follow up from last week?
 If you haven't listened to last week's episode, here is an nutshell.
 We we tiptoed into the waters of the US election.
 Hot on the heels of Donald Trump being elected as the next president of the United States.
 We thought we would share some thoughts.
 Again, I'm not sure how wise that was based on their fallout of what we were seeing
 from friends, from family, just from the general public on social media.
 And so we shared for nearly an hour and we did our best to make our thinking visible.
 And we asked for feedback.<br/>
 And I really want to thank all of you who wrote in.
 It was great to just read what you thought on the whole.
 It sounds like you were really encouraged by our thoughts.
 There are a few things I'd like to clarify though are our good friend Gary Morgan from Australia called on Monday afternoon and gave me some great feedback.
 Now at this point, I want to push pause and give you some context for who Gary is in case you don't know him.
 Gary and his wife Sarah are two of our best friends. We've known them for years and the four of us
 have a long and rich history together. We've been through thick and thin together,
 we're people who are in each other's lives despite living on the other side of the world.
 Speaking for AJ and I, we take their counsel seriously. Their words are big in our ears,
 so to speak. In addition to that, we're tremendous fans of them and their ministry.
 They're the leaders of a great church in Melbourne, Australia.
 They've ministered at Grace Center many times.
 If you don't know them, if you don't know who I'm speaking about, when I say
 Gary and Sarah Morgan, do yourself a favor, listen to their podcasts that we
 did with them a while back.<br/>
 It's episode 90.<br/>
 So just go to Alan and Ajay.com/90 to listen to.
 You'll really be blessed.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 With that context out of the way, let me give you another piece of context.
 Normally when AJ and I record a podcast before we get on air, we write down a few sentences.
 We try and keep this as spontaneous as possible, but we do put down a couple of sentences here
 and there, some jumping off points to talk about that sort of thing. Last week, I just checked,
 we wrote down 2000 words of talking points. Seriously, on a topic that large, that volatile,
 we wanted to shove down a ton of points and meander through them.
 And we knew there was no way we'd get through everything.
 We wouldn't cover everything.<br/>
 Otherwise, the podcast would have been way longer
 than the 50 minutes it almost was.<br/>
 We also record our podcast on Sunday nights.
 It's literally the last thing we do in the week.
 We put our kids to bed and then we record a podcast,
 usually about eight or nine p.m. at night.
 and then I edit it into the wee hours of Monday morning
 to get ready for you guys Monday morning.
 That gives you some other context,<br/>
 which I'll come back to in a second.<br/>
 So anyway, Gary calls on Monday<br/>
 and he says, "Bro, I listened to your podcast
 "on the election, I've got some thoughts for you.
 "Would you be willing to hear them?"<br/>
 I'm like, "Dude, of course."<br/>
 So he said, "I thought you did a really good job
 "of representing your thought pattern,
 "regarding your confusion about how evangelical
 and charismatic leaders could possibly support Trump.
 I thought you did a great job on that.
 I thought you did a good job of talking about the fallout of that and why people on both
 sides of Trump and Clinton supporters were feeling so confused about the results of the
 election.<br/>
 But I feel like you didn't do a good job of actually representing how Christians who
 do support Trump have reconciled that gap.
 And I feel like without saying my name, you misrepresented my views.
 Now, understand here, I'm obviously paraphrasing Gary sentiments, but I have checked with him
 to make sure I'm not misrepresenting the gist of what he said.
 And that's as good a summary as we need for what I need to say next.
 So again, let's pause.<br/>
 What is he referencing here?<br/>
 So backtrack a little a few days before the election happened.
 Gary posted to Facebook and Twitter and said this, I'm going to say it, vote Trump.
 And then he had a couple of hashtags, hashtag my conviction, hashtag I've seen the future,
 hashtag America's time and hashtag Cyrus rising.
 Now I'll be honest, when I saw Gary's tweet and Facebook post, my first thought was that
 he'd been hacked.<br/>
 Honestly, it was so, you know, I was still in the stage of just rolling my eyes and shaking
 my head that people like, like Gary were tweeting things like that.
 Gary and I had not had a conversation about the election.
 Maybe we had, but certainly nothing as strong as I had come out.
 So I was really shocked to see Gary post that.
 And I reached out to him via text.<br/>
 I was like, dude, some crazy person is using your name
 and misrepresenting you on social media, which led to a phone call.
 I think later that day where we talked.
 Now, why am I bringing all this up?<br/>
 Well, if you remember the podcast last week,
 I talked about my grave concern at charismatic and evangelical leaders posting about Donald
 Trump and not actually explaining their thought.
 Just using these sound bites, which were hugely inflammatory.
 Now, Gary, of course, as I've just told you, was one of those charismatic and evangelical
 leaders.<br/>
 And while I didn't name him, there's a sense that people could have come into the conclusion
 I was throwing Gary under the bus or I was using my very public podcast to very publicly
 rebuke him.<br/>
 Now what, well first of all, that was never ever my intent at all.
 And I've already apologized to Gary in person and I can absolutely see how people would
 come to that conclusion.<br/>
 And to further complicate this thing, Gary and I have a lot of the same followers.
 So a lot of the people who'd follow Gary on Instagram and Facebook would listen to this
 podcast and would follow me on Twitter and Instagram, etc. And so there was a danger that
 people could think, "Yeah, like I said, I'm throwing Gary under the bus or I'm just slapping him from the
 other side of the world." Now, what nobody but Gary and I would have known is that we'd already
 talked before we'd ever recorded the podcast. I called him really as soon as I saw that tweet
 and said, "Dude, I think that was probably on wise to have posted that. Like, I'm not sure if you're
 aware of the political culture, of the culture that's going on. But I think that probably,
 not that it misrepresented your views, but that one little soundbite doesn't actually
 represent your heart. And while we're on that topic, can you explain to me how you've reconciled
 the obvious struggles that I've come to? And really, hopefully, Gary shared with me some
 really pertinent revelation about why he felt like supporting Trump was a good idea. And more
 than that, just as a prophet, why he was feeling like this is what the Lord is up to in this
 season. And here's the bit I'm really bummed about. Now I'm bummed that it looked like
 I misrepresented my friend and dishonored him in public that I'm really bummed about
 that. But the sad part for me, for Gary, for everybody else was the revelation that he
 shared when we had a phone call was really helpful in bridging the gap. And it was one
 of the things I'd written in my 2000 words of show prep and we just never got to it.
 So in leaving that out, well forget that, in not referencing Gary by name, in not addressing
 the conversation and not even talking about the helpful revelation I've had, I realized
 it really did look like I was slapping him publicly, something I would never ever do.
 But I think what gave me most is just for Gary personally, we had already talked privately
 and I didn't actually fully represent him well.
 I did expose in general terms, "Hey, I don't like it when Christian leaders do this."
 But I didn't bridge the gap and I didn't bring the other stuff that Gary shared with
 me, which actually put my heart at ease about a number of things.
 So Gary and I have talked a number of times this week and the more he shared his perspective,
 the more I wish people could hear that
 rather than just the sound by of, you know,
 Cyrus rising, you know, God is chosen Trump, et cetera, et cetera.
 So who knows, maybe we can have Gary come on the podcast
 and we can talk about this thing in a bit more detail
 'cause actually I think it would really,
 in the same way that helped me,<br/>
 I think it would really help our listeners
 to hear from his perspective,<br/>
 just from a prophetic perspective,<br/>
 from his wisdom perspective.<br/>
 The slight complication is his wife's about
 to give birth to their second baby<br/>
 and my wife is in bed recovering from surgery,
 but let's hope we can get that on the books
 'cause I think that would be really, really helpful.
 In the meantime, however,<br/>
 I wanted to sincerely apologize to Gary and my listeners.
 I did not have Gary in mind when talking last week
 and I'm really sorry if it sounded like I was slapping Gary
 with a public rebuke.<br/>
 I can totally see how one might arrive without a conclusion,
 but that would never be my heart<br/>
 and I wanted to step in and clarify that.
 One other thing that Gary shared with me
 that on reflection, I agree with and I really appreciate him
 bringing this to my attention.<br/>
 He said this out at one point, you sounded contemptuous
 and that's not who I know you to be.<br/>
 So I really listened to the podcast<br/>
 and sadly I think he was right.<br/>
 I was teaching this week on the school supernatural life.
 I was talking about communication,<br/>
 I was talking about conflict<br/>
 and I was teaching the students how I confront,
 actually one of the things that Gary and I
 went through in our phone call.<br/>
 At one point in our phone call, I was like,
 "Gary, dude, I wish we were recording this phone call
 because I think it'd be so helpful for people to hear
 how friends, how leaders can talk through issues
 with love, with power, with confrontation,
 but we didn't record it.<br/>
 So maybe we can recreate that conversation
 if and when I can get them on the show again.
 But anyway, I was teaching them some verses
 that have long been dear to me.<br/>
 This is 2 Timothy 2, 24.<br/>
 says, "The Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome, but must be kind to everyone, able to teach,
 not resentful." And then Philippians 4 verse 5 says, "Let your gentleness be evident to all."
 In light of those verses and Gary's input, I wanted to apologize again. I want to be known
 more for my gentleness than for my forthrightness. And it wasn't my heart to be quarrelsome, but I
 I think at times I came across like that.
 So to my friend Gary, sorry dude for misrepresenting you.
 I know I've already apologized to you privately,
 but I feel like I wanna apologize to you publicly too.
 To my listeners who also follow Gary,<br/>
 sorry if I caused you undue trauma,<br/>
 Gary and I are really, really good.<br/>
 And lastly, I wanna apologize for not being as gentle
 as I wanted to be in hindsight.<br/>
 And for any contempt I had in my voice,
 I would love to try and get the mighty Welsh eagle
 in the podcast to share his perspectives.
 And hopefully we can make that happen.
 But in the meantime, let's talk about something else that's awesome.
 Mr. Steve Long, how the heck are you?<br/>
 I am generally doing excellent.<br/>
 Just finished six weeks of doing nothing, almost nothing.
 Is that a poor character or is this walking in the light?
 This was a week's missions in Mozambique, which was easy.
 than a week at pastors' events in England, which was easy, then three weeks of cruising,
 which was easy, and then a week sick in bed with a viral infection, which was easy.
 I think your version of doing nothing in my version of doing nothing are too complete,
 you say Mozambique and I don't hear doing nothing.
 Well, this year was actually the least we've been busy whenever we'd been there.
 How many times have you been to Mozambique?
 Six, six or seven times.<br/>
 And this is with Heidi and Roland with Heidi and Roland. Yeah, it's less busy when Heidi and Roland are not there. Of course
 So she was supposed to be there on the Tuesday. We arrived on a Monday. She's supposed to arrive on the Tuesday
 Turned out she arrived on the Saturday as we were getting on the very same plane going out that she got in
 So we didn't see her there, but she'd been at our church the previous week. So we were cool
 Were you speaking the harvest school or were you a mission?
 The Harvard School was relocated.<br/>
 They had some visa issues getting their students to stay
 in Mozambique for the length of their schools
 so they were in South Africa.<br/>
 So we were asked to shift and go to South Africa again,
 which we did two years ago.<br/>
 And we just declined and said,<br/>
 "Our team really wanna go to Pemba.<br/>
 They wanna be with the kids.<br/>
 They wanna just do all that kind of stuff."
</p><ul>
  <li>Did you happen to get to go to Schwiba,
 the village that Grace and her adopted?
  </li><li>The closest village to the Pema Bay.
  </li><li>Sander and I didn't go on the outreach.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>We let our team go there.
 One of the reasons we let our team go without us
 is because people will default to us.
 So it forces them that they're doing the stuff,
 which was cool.
 And we then go to the Pema Beach Hotel,
 which is a four star hotel.
  </li><li>So literally you did do nothing.
 It's all becoming clear.
 You've paid your dues though.
  </li><li>So we took their missionaries out for dinner
 and prayed with them and ministered to them.
 So that was primarily what our team did this time.
 He's ministering to their team.
 Yeah, great.
  </li><li>There's a chance that some people,
 some poor people might not know who you are.
 So by way of introduction,
 I'm gonna tell them what I know about you
 and you're gonna fix up.
 'Cause it feels like every time I see you,
 your job has changed somewhat.
 So I've known Steve since 2003,
 when I came, I mean, I knew all of you.
 We didn't get to know each other till a couple of years later,
 but I came to the school in Toronto.
 When I arrived, you were the senior associate pastor
 of the Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship.
 Previously, the Toronto Airport vineyard
 currently catch the fire Toronto.
  </li><li>That's correct.
  </li><li>And you were a Baptist pastor,
 maybe you still are a Baptist pastor in disguise.
  </li><li>Now, you were a Baptist pastor.
  </li><li>I'm not Baptistic anymore.
 According to the Baptist--
  </li><li>Bylaws.
  </li><li>Bylaws and all that kind of stuff, yeah.
  </li><li>But you, maybe we'll get you to tell the story,
 but you were a Baptist pastor,
 that when the revival started in the church
 that we're both from now in Toronto,
 your current church, your current Baptist church,
 paid your salary to go and be a pastor at this church
 'cause they needed help.
  </li><li>For five months.
  </li><li>Which is amazing.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>And we'll get you to tell some stories.
 So you for the last, for as long as I've known you,
 have been part of the senior team,
 part of the executive team,
 for not just the church in Toronto,
 but the global movement of Catch the Fire.
 So you have spent a long season of your life,
 ministry not only to Toronto, but all over the world.
 That's correct.
 And you, I've asked you to speak about healing.
 And I want to talk to you a little bit about healing.
 When I teach on healing, I always introduce it by saying, I learned everything I know
 about healing from three people, John and Carol Arna and Steve Long.
 So you would be the person that would have helped my left brain put theology
 to what I would have seen John and Carol and of course, yourself do. You've got to be one of the
 finest teachers in physical healing. I know in terms of removing the mystery and just going
 straight to the gospel, straight to the scripture and explaining it. And so we have you in every
 year to teach on our school, School of Supernatural Life. Love doing that.
  </li><li>I love it.
  </li><li>And yeah, I learned from four people,
 John and Carol, so that's mutual.
 (laughing)
 And a Canadian by the name of Bill Prankard,
 who's a Pentecostal gentleman and a great storyteller.
 He's, that's his best thing is the,
 just creating an atmosphere where people are expecting
 the miraculous to take place.
 And then a very left brain gentleman from Texas by the name of Roger Sapp, S-A-P-P.
 Roger is not a big name kind of guy, but he just has figured out the theology of how Jesus healed
 the sick and was one of the gentlemen that really helped me, heard him speak live many times,
 listened to his stuff, read his books on healing. Very, very helpful.
 Wow. The little prayer that I use my healing belongs to me because of what Jesus has done.
 I receive my healing now. That's Rogers. I thought it was Sam Larby's Sam stole it from me.
 No. Yes. So I stole it from Sam. So chapter one of Sam's book is about me.
 So whenever I teach on healing, I usually start what I learned from John is John told me he said
 "The more you teach on healing, the less people will get healed. The more you heal people, people
 will get healed and then explain why it happens later. Like just start by healing and then give
 the theology. You said because most people in church have already got a theology of why it won't
 work. So if you can break that by demonstrating, I want to tell some stories about you before you
 tell some stories. So one of the very first times I ever saw you in action was your friend Kevin
 Pete's church in Glasgow. Glasgow Elam is now passed by some other amazing pastors and I lived
 dinner at the time. You and I had not yet met, I hadn't moved to Toronto and I'd heard that
 somebody from Toronto was in town, so I drove over. And your opening line was, "My name's Steve,
 it's great to be with you tonight. We're going to teach on healing." But before we teach on healing,
 why don't we heal the sickest person in the room and then everything else should be easy
 after that? So can we have a volunteer? Who's the sickest person in the room? And I'm thinking,
 "Good Lord, who is this guy? I hope this works."
 And we all readily agreed that it was the person in the wheelchair.
 Who was the sickest person in the room?
 I remember that.
 And so then you said, "If I pray for it,
 you're all going to think it was me, the healeder."
 So why don't we find who's never healed anything before?
 And so these two ladies eagerly volunteer and they were like,
 "You've never healed anything before?"
 You're like, "No."
 So you're like, "Well, and this was the sum total of your teaching."
 Jesus said that you'll lay hands on the sick and they'll recover.
 So we've got somebody sick.
 We've got some people to lay hands on.
 Now place your hands on this lady.
 Just check if it's okay.
 And then the two women who said
 that they're gonna pray for it, they start shaking.
 And you said, wow, doesn't that look odd?
  </li><li>I don't remember that part.
  </li><li>So they start shaking, they start manifesting
 and you said, wow, doesn't that look odd?
 Why don't we ask the lady what she's feeling?
 Let's ignore these people for a second.
 So you said, ma'am, how are you feeling now?
 And she gives us tests.
  </li><li>This is the lady in the wheelchair.
  </li><li>This is the lady in the wheelchair going.
  </li><li>Okay, I do remember that.
 I don't remember the other two ladies.
 then weren't the shakers you're saying?
 No, they were manifesting.
 Yes.
 So they were doing something weird, and you by way of calming everybody.
 Because we're all on the edge of our seats, like what is going on.
 Long story short, the woman gets healed, and then you go on to teach, and we all pray for
 everybody.
 And I was like, I have literally never, ever seen anybody with that level of faith.
 Cold open.
 Let's heal a six person in the room.
 I do that only a few times.
 I would really have to hear the Holy Spirit say, do that.
 And the way that I know that I'm supposed to do that is I hear the words do show and tell.
 So if I hear do show and tell, that's what we do.
 When I say we, I'm referring to the Holy Spirit doing it and me coming along for the ride.
 My second favorite story was you were teaching a deliverance workshop at one of the conferences.
 And I came along to just, you know, I always wanted to learn more.
 And so it's a two two p.m.
 session at a conference where all in the upper rooms and you're teaching on deliverance and
 then you say quite calmly, okay, now that I've taught you on deliverance, let's do practice,
 let's get in groups of twos and threes and we're going to cast out demons out of each other.
 You know, my little brethren brain just exploded like, wait, that's okay, I guess that's what we're
 doing. We're making an assumption that Christians will have demons.
 Well, but my point is you've got such an amazing ability, Steve, to very, very clearly,
 do in many ways nothing more than what the gospels are teaching us to do, but make that not threatening.
 And when people do that, they have tremendous results. So folks, if you have not heard Steve
 Long, there are some stories that introduce you to the kind of person that we're going to be talking
 about today. Let's go back to the beginning. You were a Baptist pastor. Were you a cessationist?
 Do you do you? So you firmly resolved that God no longer healed?
 Well, I wouldn't say firmly resolved, but that's the tradition that was raised in.
 the Bible school that I went to, that's what they taught. And so I just sort of assumed that that's
 the correct theology. And we did not see people healed at our church. Now, the fact that we never
 prayed for them sort of never was brought into the equation. But the fact that nobody was healed,
 it's sort of like, well, reinforced what you already knew. It's circular thinking. So we don't
 don't pray this sick because the sick don't get healed,
 which they didn't get healed, they died.
  </li><li>Prose are great theology.
 I've drawn that correlation that most people
 with a great theology that God doesn't heal today
 don't see anybody healed.
 And usually they're the people that oppose the theology
 of the people who are seeing people get healed.
  </li><li>That goes way, way back.
 And I cannot remember his name if I'd known we're gonna talk
 about this, I would have done the research,
 but goes back to the first great awakening in America
 when you had Jonathan Edwards.
 And I can't remember the guy's name,
 but he was the president of Yale University.
  </li><li>Oh, wow.
  </li><li>And both of them had Godly wives.
 Both of them, the wives are sick.
 And Jonathan Edwards' wife recovered miraculously.
 And so Jonathan Edwards teaches that signs and wonders
 and miracles are for today.
 The other gentleman's wife passes away.
 She dies.
 And so he's trying to figure out why.
 And the best that he can come up with is,
 God doesn't heal the sick anymore.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>And so he based, he was one of the first people
 to teach "Sasational."
 I tell the story, it's in the Healing Belongs to me book.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So we can maybe find that afterwards,
 but his theology is based on a negative experience.
 And Jonathan Edwards theology is based
 on a positive experience.
  </li><li>I think it was you that taught me this line
 that a healthy dose of experience does wonders for your theology.
 I don't know if I say that in that words, but when you experience things, it forces your theology
 to adapt. And if your theology is an incorrect theology that doesn't line up with the scriptures,
 that's hard because if you've been taught that something is right, it's right, it's right, it's
 right. And now you're having experiences that are different. The question is, are your experiences
 wrong or was your theology wrong?
 Right.
 So talk to me about how you switch from being a Baptist
 cessationist. I mean, I'm imagining this happened in 1994 with the outpouring.
 93 before. Okay.
 Before that happened. Talk to me about what happened.
 Probably 92 and 93. In the early 90s, our Baptist church began to do
 Willow Creek from Chicago, Bill Hyblas, Stel Church, seeker focused.
 We were the first church in our denomination to do that.
 Got all sorts of flack from people not knowing what we were doing and why we were doing it.
 First church to have a band, first church to wear jeans and a t-shirt for the pastors and that kind of stuff.
 There was two other churches in the Greater Toronto area also doing that.
 One that started the same time as us and one that had been going about a year prior.
 So the three of us would meet, the three leadership teams would meet regularly.
 We'd trade dramas, we'd talk about which sermon series are working.
 We just talk how we do this.
 Right.
 And the church in Newmarket, which was ahead of us, was doing the best.
 Everyone agreed.
 You know, they're, they, they got it figured out.
 But a Pentecostal church in Mississauga was seeing more people in their meetings.
 They were growing quicker than we were.
 Despite their ban not being as good, their actors not being as good, their service flow
 not being as good, their logistics not being as good, but they're growing better than we
 were.
 Right.
 You just said, "What guys, what are you doing?
 How's this happening?"
 And they were a little sneaky, not sneaky, but they were just sort of little, "You don't
 really want to ask that question."
 It's like, "No, we do."
 And it's like, "Well, you're not going to be happy with the answer, so don't ask."
 And it's like, "No, tell us."
 And they said, "Well, you guys don't have the Holy Spirit."
 Boom.
 And it was like, "What do you mean?"
 He goes, "Well, when you pray for people afterwards for drug addictions and alcohol and
 marriages to be restored, you've got no oomph."
 That's what I mean, we have no of.
 And we had this very, it was a shock to us that maybe we were missing something.
 And right about that time, one of the Baptist churches in our denomination began to have
 massive success in healing and deliverance.
 And it was like, oh my goodness, they're doing things a little different too.
 and it turned out that they were charismatic.
 So that sort of opened the box up to us of,
 well, let's take a look at this again.
  </li><li>So that was your first exposure
 to things of the spirit in that realm?
  </li><li>I would say it was my first exposure
 in the practical side of it.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I'd read books and why things don't happen
 and all that kind of stuff.
  </li><li>So do you have any standout memories
 of seeing the Holy Spirit move that stumped your intellect?
  </li><li>Yeah, the first big healing that we had
 Baptist Church was one of our deacons. Walter was his name and he was 35. I would have been 35 as
 well, good friend. He was scheduled for back surgery and he asked us as pastors if we would
 pray the James 5 prayer of healing over him. Well, we never had done that and so we decided we'll do
 it at the Sunday night meeting, which is a young adult focus meeting. And we didn't know how to do
 it, we saw that you're supposed to put oil on the guy. So we put all but we didn't know
 how much. We just put on a whole bottle kind of thing and just drenched them. We didn't
 know to say, how are you and check yourself? We just prayed that he would be healed. He
 would be restored. The next day, he didn't have his surgery. He went into the surgeon's
 office, I guess, in the prep room and someone dropped a piece of paper, Walter bent over,
 picked it up and give it to the guy. And the guy goes, what did you just do? And it was
 like his back had been healed.
 So that caused lots of excitement in our Baptist church.
 And then people started lining up and saying, well, I've got this problem.
 I've got this problem.
 And so Sunday nights became a fun, experimenting without the deacons of our
 church, knowing other than Walter, because they didn't come to the evening
 meeting.
 They have sort of the, the, the guards, the rear guard who would have been very
 opposed to those kinds of things.
 And then it began, when it began to be very,
 start getting into the morning service
 where people were sharing stories and testimonies
 that I just got healed last Sunday night.
 All of a sudden like this now became an issue.
 We had to talk it through.
 And it was a little contentious for a while of people,
 well, yes, healing's in the Bible,
 but that's not how the Baptist do it.
 So we came up against that.
 And I would think for me,
 there was two little theological things
 that the Lord highlighted,
 and one of them was the scripture verse in John chapter 10
 where Jesus says, "My sheep hear my voice."
 So I'd been taught that God stopped speaking,
 and it was like, well, how does that relate to that verse?
 And then the other one is in Hebrews where it says
 that Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
 And so if Jesus doesn't change,
 how does dispensational theology, cessationism,
 how do all those things work?
 And John Arnett was very, very helpful for me
 of just putting those ones together.
 when I started to get to know John.
  </li><li>Wow.
 So you began to see stuff,
 which then challenged your thinking,
 and then you, you know, the scriptures become a,
 not a stumbling block at all,
 but you're like, well, hang on, wait a minute.
 It's so easy to skim over the stuff
 that doesn't apply to you in scripture, isn't it?
  </li><li>Yeah, so for example, we had verses like Jesus says,
 "The greater things you'll be able to do."
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So we would have no, in our Baptist church,
 we would not see that as greater miracles,
 which it seems like really is what Jesus is talking about,
 greater activities, greater miracles, greater healings.
 And so we would just say, well,
 he was being very evangelistic.
  </li><li>Enthusiastic. - Enthusiastic.
 He's over the top.
 And now I look at that and it's like, no, no, no,
 he meant that. - Right.
  </li><li>And he only had three years to do ministry.
 So Steve Long's gonna have 30, 50 years to do ministry.
 I do have the opportunity of doing greater miracles.
 So talk to me about what happened when you began to see the Holy Spirit, especially in
 light of the revival that happened.
 I mean, I tell me the story about when you first came to the church and Randy was ministering
 and some of the miracles that you saw.
 And what sort of paradigm shifts did that do for you?
 Yeah, that was clearly a big one.
 If I can just back up in 90, May of '93, maybe March of '93,
 there was a prophetic conference at the airport church
 and Mark DePont and Mark Verclier were the two guest speakers.
 And Mark did an afternoon seminar and hearing God's voice.
 And I took that seminar and that's when I began
 to believe that God spoke.
 I began to do journaling.
 And as I was journaling, all sorts of questions began
 be answered that I felt good with. So John Arnett knows me. I've already been asked by John
 in May 93 to join the staff. Oh, really? I know that. And so this is before the revival.
 Nothing big's happening. Just he'd heard that I was a good organizer. I'd had a prophetic word.
 I wouldn't say prophetic word. I'd had a journaling word that I was to assist John.
 Wow. So I went to talk to him and he was sort of put me off until I accidentally quoted
 his prayer. And he and Carol have been praying every morning, send this someone to help us
 accomplish our vision. And in the end of my breakfast meeting where I'm taking John out to say,
 "I feel the Lord told me that I'm supposed to work for you." And he didn't get it. He didn't
 really understand what I was saying. And so to try to clarify, I said, "Well, John, here's the bottom
 line is I'm supposed to help you accomplish your vision." So he went home and told Carol,
 "I think I know who that guy is." The problem was that there's no salary.
 Right. Small thing.
 Small thing.
 You don't have a wife or kids to raise.
 So when, yes, because I had two kids and a wife and Sandra, when we found out that we
 were offered a job, the job was quit your Baptist church.
 That pays.
 That pays good.
 This was '93.
 I was making 40,000, which was a good salary with the Baptists.
 So when the revival began with Randy Clark that weekend in January '94, John phoned
 us on the Monday morning to say, Randy's been held over one more night.
 You need to get here.
 And so Santa and I went that night along with John and
 Anne Freel, who were the Baptist pastors we were working with, who
 were going on the very same journey as we were.
 And my brother Richard, uh, in his wife, Terry and Richard was a year in
 advance to us.
 He'd gone to a John Wembert conference, uh, in 93 and came back speaking in
 tongues, which was anathema and the Baptist church.
 He was supposed to quit except his Baptist church wanted him to speak in
 sent him to the conference hoping and praying that he'd have an experience.
 When Randy finished preaching, it was a... My recollection was it was distracting from the very beginning.
 Do people know Peter Jackson?
 No.
 Okay. Peter is a guy who's basically been drunk in the Holy Spirit for the last 20 years.
 He giggles all the time, trying to figure out why is he giggling.
 Right.
 It's like he's got his own jokes that he's playing through his own brain somehow.
 Right.
 And he's not quiet.
 He's not quiet.
 quiet. And he's just, he's a fun loving guy. He's nice. He's kind. He's very
 anointed. He teaches on the father's love, helps people with shame issues and rejection issues,
 marvelous ministry. But I didn't know who he was. And he's sitting in the front row with his wife
 and they're both drunk and falling off their chair before the band started. So it's just like,
 how does John Arden get these basket cases in his church?
 right? And why is he letting them sit in the front row? Yes. And why is this allowed?
 Why is the usher not doing anything? All that kind of stuff. And it's not just them and other
 people that are watching them and laughing at them and pointing at them and all these different
 kinds of things. So we just had no grid for that. I knew vineyard style worship and it was wonderful.
 Love the the presence. So that wasn't the problem. But all the way through the worship,
 people are manifesting and falling down and shaking and all that kind of stuff.
 And then John and Carol provoked it after worship.
 There'd be, Peter, come on up, tell everyone what's going on.
 And he can't talk and he's fallen over.
 And so this would happen night after night.
 But that particular night, Randy gave the very same talk that he did in the Thursday
 night because he'd only brought three talks.
 He was supposed to have been home by then.
 So he gave apparently the very same talk and the same invitation,
 which was if you're dry and need Jesus up to the front, well, that's me.
 If you are wanting more of the Holy Spirit up to the front, you're full of the Holy Spirit and want
 more. Well, okay, that's not me. And you need to get born again up to the front. That's not me.
 So I didn't go sat in the back row and John Freelswife Anne went to the front row.
 And she stood in a corner and start sobbing and sobbing and sobbing.
 No one's praying for her yet, just sobbing.
 And half an hour, you know, about 10 minutes in, John, her husband goes up to
 the front, are you okay?
 And she's crying too much to tell him what's going on.
 So to send him back to a seat.
 And so we're watching this.
 We're watching everyone else.
 It's a little bit of a show.
 It's, it's fun.
 It's awkward.
 It's all those kind of things all at once.
 And it's totally new.
 This is totally new.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So we have no grid for this kind of stuff.
 And then sort of turns around.
 She's composed herself.
 And she starts to walk back.
 And there's maybe 10 rows in that old building, Alan.
 I never saw.
 OK.
 I'm going to say it was wider than it was deeper.
 So maybe 10 rows.
 And by the time she gets from the corner to our row,
 walking 10 rows. So let's say it's 30 feet. She's in hysterics, laughing hysterics like cannot
 control herself just it's gone from crying to laughing over the top laughing. And she sits in
 our row and everyone's like, what happened? What was going on? And she's she can't talk. She's every
 time we asked the question, what was happening? She's just last more. So we're dealing with that now.
 So Anne has joined them.
 Then the prayer team start to do some.
 Malicious behavior, which is that they stopped praying for all the people in the front and started praying for people in the seats.
 Wow.
 So we got nobody safe.
 Nobody's safe, but we're in the back row.
 So we got maybe two or three minutes.
 We decide time to go.
 So we're putting our coats on because it's Canada January and Randy sees us.
 So when Randy sees us putting our coats on,
 he stopped what he was doing and ran to the back and said, can I pray for you?
 And it was very awkward because nobody wants to be prayed for.
 Right.
 We're like, we've seen enough.
 Yeah. This is weird.
 This is not us.
 Right.
 This is love, John and Carol.
 Love the Holy Spirit.
 No, no, we don't love the Holy Spirit.
 The Holy Spirit is our version of the Holy Spirit.
 The Holy Spirit has been a gentleman up until this time.
 And this version of the Holy Spirit, we're not sure about it.
 Right.
 So as Randy says, who can I pray for first?
 And thinks this is still very, very funny.
 So she's still laughing.
 We all agreed that Richard and Terry should be the ones to be prayed for first because
 they already speak in tongues.
 Exactly.
 So this is my brother.
 He's 18 years younger than me.
 Up until I was married, we had shared a bedroom almost all of our life.
 Bible school included.
 And he is on the floor shaking in seconds.
 And so this is, oh my goodness.
  </li><li>'Cause you know him.
 You know he's not faking.
  </li><li>Never seen this.
 Never seen this.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>His wife, Terry, it was like, if anyone was going to manifest it to be her and she did,
 it was like, okay.
  </li><li>That one doesn't count.
  </li><li>That doesn't count, yes.
 And then John Freels prayed for it and he falls down.
 And John and I had been working together.
 He's the senior pastor.
 I was the associate pastor at the Baptist Church for five years, prayed every day.
 This has never happened.
 So that's a little, and still laughing at everything.
 Then it's Sandra and I left and he's,
 so it's okay, we take our coats off, we stand there.
 And Alan, I knew that if I put my hands out,
 what like everyone else was doing,
 palms up that this is gonna be a life-changing experience.
 I just knew that.
 It seemed like it was a long pondering,
 but I think it was just a second.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But it's like, my life's gonna be different.
  </li><li>You had enough wear with all two.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I know that you were on the precipice
 of something incredible.
  </li><li>Something's gonna be,
 going to be kicked out of my denomination because I'm going to start manifesting or something
 like that. You might even speak in tongues. Yes. And that would get me kicked out. So we
 did that and I close my eyes and Randy probably within three seconds stops his prayer and
 he talks to my wife, he says, what's the problem? Now that is a problem because I don't know
 that there's a problem. Right. So when he says, what's the problem? Sandra says, I don't
 want to fall down. So that says to me, she's on the verge of falling down. Oh, my goodness,
 it's happening to my life. Right. And he says, I'm not touching you. And it's like, Oh, that's
 even worse. So what's going on? And he says, we're just going to pray. And I don't remember
 what he said, but I heard my knees telling me you got five seconds. And then I heard my
 knees. We're not sure we're not kidding. I'm on the ground. And I'd never been on the
 ground in my life has a result of being prayed for. I felt the peace of God. I come to know
 that that's what it was now. But at that point, I just didn't know. And it was one of the
 most amazing experiences here, everything that's going on, all the conversations, and
 just chose to be there because it was so life giving.
 So you're now on the floor? Yep. You can feel the peace of God.
 Yeah. Look to my right there, Sandra. She's out with it too.
 Look to my left. There's my brother shaking. And somewhere you're seeing your pastors on
 floor too. And still laughing at all of us. And so what do you think like cognitively,
 what are you thinking? I just know knew that it was different. I didn't know that it was a unique
 touch of God. I didn't know that until the next morning. So I can't remember all that we discussed,
 but I do remember when I woke up the next morning, I wanted to read my Bible that had not been a
 thought that I'd had in 10 years. Wow. Was only reading the Bible for summer prep.
 Right. Never for pleasure. Never for just getting to go.
 Relationship. No.
 Didn't like praying. Like I prayed, but I didn't like it.
 It didn't, I didn't flow. There was no sort of enjoyment.
 There was no.
 There was something you did.
 It didn't, it was duty. I read the whole book of Acts and I found
 passages that I'd never seen before.
 I saw stories that I hadn't didn't know were there.
 Wow. Like they, they obviously had been there, but I just hadn't seen them before.
 And now everything's making sense.
 All the Holy Spirit stuff is making sense.
 And it's like, OK, I'm in.
 I'm in.
 But then it went from Canada to the nations.
 Britain first Europe in then America.
 Yes, within probably within three weeks by the end of January,
 the venue is too small.
 The auditorium sat 300 320 had an overflow overflow where kids were on Sundays.
 that was maybe 250, 300, put a video screen in there.
 So you're separated by eight feet of concrete.
 And both of those venues are full.
 And people just coming from all these evangelical places,
 evangelical churches.
 And then as time went on, we rented banquet halls
 and hotel rooms and larger venues.
 And so eventually we went into the venue
 where we are now, which at that time could seat 5,000.
  </li><li>Here was my report when I came.
 My rapport, you know, I called my parents
 who were very concerned about where I was.
 And I said, every time I go to service,
 I see two things happen.
 I see people give their lives to Jesus
 and I see people get physically healed.
 Something I'd never seen on a consistent basis.
 Literally every meeting I went to.
 And obviously you were there from pretty much day one.
 I got there way later.
 I got there in 2003, I missed a lot of it.
 Tell me some standout healings, miracles,
 or just crazy God stories from the years that you've--
  </li><li>Yeah, we should have been more proactive
 of just really journaling these things
 and writing them down and having someone keep track
 'cause there was sensational miracles
 and healings that were taking place.
 So a couple of things that I remember,
 in the overflow room, it was concrete floor.
 It was just basically a warehouse
 that we put a rug down and had kids church in there.
 And people would be, we put red masking tape on the ground
 And so people are standing in lines and you had to have a catcher, otherwise it's a hard
 fall.
 Right.
 And so they're catching having a catcher to catch people if they were falling or shaking.
 And in 94, the manifestations, I'm going to just say we're at a higher level, more intense.
 So there was more people laughing than there is now, more people falling on the ground
 than there was now more shaking than there is now.
 It was just almost everybody's manifesting something.
 9 out of 10 people are on the ground violently experiencing God, violently good experiencing
 God. And apparently, I don't remember this lady being prayed for her who prayed for her,
 but she was probably in her 60s, tiny little lady and just disfigured jaw. Her jaws are
 a little offset. So her face is a little slanted. And she's been prayed for. She's on
 the ground. And the guy beside her is a WWE wrestler. No, huge. He's not an actual wrestler,
 but he's that body size. He's a huge, he's four times bigger than this little lady. And
 the catcher can't catch him because he's shaking as he's falling. And he goes sideways
 and lands on this lady does a body slam. He's unaware that he's on anyone. He's out. And
 That's the, that's what you hear from the prayer team
 who are on that line and everyone's running
 'cause they see what's happened.
  </li><li>Small lady sandwich.
  </li><li>I was maybe two rows behind if I remember right.
 So I didn't see the lady,
 but that's what everyone told me.
 She's got this figured face and this big guy falls.
 So when I hear it, here's a guy that is being rolled off
 a lady and it's like lawsuit waiting to happen.
 And her eyes are bugged out.
 She's like in shock, like a 300 pound guy
 is just plopped on top of her.
 Doesn't know that she's 100 pounds.
 And anyways, her jaw was healed by the Lord
 with that guy fell on her.
 And I was like, okay, no problems.
  </li><li>That's an unusual prayer ministry approach.
 Stand here, this guy's gonna fall on you.
  </li><li>Those kinds of things were like,
 well, you can't script that.
 right. There's another one. I have a friend. He had to choose the name, go by his middle
 name, which is Mark Edwards, because anytime anyone ever said Jonathan Edwards, he'd just
 go crazy manifesting. So he can't even be called but his own name. So they have to call
 Mark. And he and Trevor Baker had nightly meetings at their little church in the middle
 of England and middle of nowhere. And his first time in Toronto, he is on the ground
 And he's just having a quiet time.
 Meanwhile, three or four rows away is a guy with cowboy boots who's shaking violently.
 And apparently one of his cowboy boots is shaking off of his foot.
 Ghost flying through the air and lands beside Mark.
 Doesn't hit him.
 Just lands beside him.
 And as soon as it lands beside Mark, he starts shaking and he has, he would say his
 impartation of anointing for revival from cowboy boots landing beside him from a guy
 two through rose away. And it's like, like you say you can't make the stuff up. It's like,
 it's like, no, we had all sorts of Japanese that came over in a group, and they're, they're not happy.
 They're, this is not normal. This is not polite. This is not whatever they're expecting until
 they started getting prayed for and they lost it they just became kids. And one guy I remember was
 somehow he's throwing snowballs imaginary holy spirit snowballs at people and he just roll his
 hands like he's rolling a snowball and throw it at a friend and it would hit him and the guy
 guy be knocked over, like on the ground. And others would be going, what? And they started
 doing it. And we had a snowball fight in our building, people who are unaware of what's
 going on, not participating with the Japanese people over the side. And they're getting hit,
 like people, they would start throwing at people that aren't in their group. And they'd be
 be hitting the back, don't see that someone's thrown anything and fall down manifesting.
 That kind of stuff gets attention.
 You've got to really now think, oh my goodness, my goodness, first of all is, where's this
 in the Bible?
 And it clearly isn't.
 There's no snowballs in there.
 Now the best you can come up with is when the Bible says, "Keep on being filled with
 the Holy Spirit."
 Is there different ways to do that?
 So that's as good as you can get.
  </li><li>My experience with that was the first time I ever came out
 was 2002, it was the party's here conference in July.
 It was the one where everybody had a big water fight.
 Not imaginary water fight, real water.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>And when my first night there,
 I mean, I'd saved up all my money to come.
 I was so desperate, I'd read all the stories,
 I'd watched all the clips online
 and with real media players, remember that?
 And I couldn't wait to be there.
 And I was so disappointed when I got there
 because I could feel nothing.
 And to my huge frustration, Carol,
 who I didn't know at the time,
 Carol was going around throwing fireballs at people.
  </li><li>Yeah, you learned that from the Japanese.
  </li><li>The people who were listening to this,
 Carol's going around and to the naked eye,
 it looks like she is imaginary.
 I mean, she's throwing with her arm imaginary balls of fire.
 And honestly, I'm rolling my eyes.
 I'm thinking this is ridiculous.
 This is not what I came for.
 I'm full of judgment.
 This is just so ridiculous.
 Where's that in the Bible?
 How could this be God?
 And I just want to leave because I'm so frustrated.
 Literally nothing's happening to me
 and this crazy woman is running
 or throwing a imaginary fire.
 Is this what we've come to?
 Well, the neck, I come back the next day
 and as you do every service, you're doing testimonies.
 And some woman gets up and her testimony is,
 I came here last night, the pastor's wife,
 they just point dismissively at Carol,
 was throwing these imaginary fireballs
 and this legislative stimulus testament.
 I just was rolling my eyes thinking,
 "Is this what we've come to?
 "This is ridiculous."
 but then she got to the end of my row
 and she threw a fireball and it quote, unquote, hit me.
 And when it hit me, my deaf ear popped up.
  </li><li>Oh my goodness. - And I could hear.
 So at that point you're like,
 why is throwing an imaginary fireball offensive
 but spitting in the ground and making mud
 and putting on a blind man's eyes isn't offensive?
 Well, one offensive thing is in the Bible
 and the other isn't.
 But the fruit of both of those things remains the same.
 It's a fascinating topic, the whole thing of God offending the mind to reveal the heart.
 And sometimes God just offending the mind for no other reason than he's reducing, he's
 returning us to childlikeness.
 You haven't John chapter 5, Jesus going into the pool in Jerusalem.
 And if you, in my opinion, when you read that passage, Jesus is going in based on revelation.
 He's had a dream, he's had a thought, he's had a picture, because when he goes in, he
 doesn't heal everyone.
 He's looking for someone.
 And he, when he sees the guy, it says he learned that he'd been there for 38 years.
 So two options for being the learning part.
 One is that the Holy Spirit just spoke to him and said, that's your guy.
 He's been there 38 years.
 Or he just simply said to someone, an attendant, you know, tell me about that guy over there.
 Right.
 So that guy is healed on the Sabbath.
 That guy does not know that it's Jesus that's healing him because like when he's asked later
 who healed you, go, I don't know, didn't get his name.
 So it's clearly in the scriptures that he didn't know that it was Jesus healing him.
 And it is massively offensive to the religious leaders that that guy got healed because it's
 a Sabbath and he's now carrying his mat.
 So they forget that a guy has been healed for 38 years, but he's carrying a mat.
 Right.
 Then you also have the story of the lady who's bent over,
 bent over back for 18 years, remember that one?
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>It's also a Sabbath.
 And after Jesus ministers to this lady,
 Casa Demon out of her, the ruler of the synagogue stands up,
 I don't know if he stands, but he rebukes Jesus
 and this lady, there's other days to come to church
 to get healed.
 Don't come to Jesus.
 Don't you dare do a healing meeting on a Saturday.
 Lady, don't you ever, if someone asks you
 if you want to be healed on a Saturday,
 don't put your hand up.
 It's just like, forget that a great miracle just took place.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>It's nothing meaner than religion.
  </li><li>That's what it was.
 It's religious spirit, take and enjoy away.
  </li><li>I was once in New Zealand and ministering
 with Dave Richards, who we were talking about earlier.
 And I was there and worship was happening
 And I got really, really drunk in the Holy Spirit, really drunk.
 And as worship happened, I just started moving around the front row,
 just kind of praying for people.
 And then kind of worship died down, and they gave me a microphone,
 which was foolish, because I was incoherent.
 But I'm just following the Holy Spirit and just praying for people.
 And we had some cool healings.
 And what I didn't realize was the associate pastor left the church.
 And on the way home, the senior pastor told me, well,
 we have to do some cleanup with the associate pastor.
 It's like, wow, is everything OK?
 He said, well, he left the church in horror of what you were doing.
 I said, oh, I'm so sorry.
 What was I doing?
 And he was offended because he said, you started healing the sick before the preaching of the word.
 And the church says that signs and want to follow the preaching, the word of God.
 You know, when I heard that, I was like, are you?
 Wow.
 Like I've forgotten that that could be a stumbling block.
 Yeah.
 Like the earnestness of it's the same sort of thing.
 you've, are you seriously that offended the people in under your
 pastoral care have been healed?
 Because it happened in the wrong order from what you thought
 I should.
 And half the meetings, half the healings of Jesus, if he's healing
 and teaching half the time he did it first, and then taught second,
 like the feeding of the 5,000 healed everyone, everyone, 43,000 is my
 number of people that were at that meeting based on 8.34 kids today in
 New York City that are Orthodox children per family.
 Lovey.
 8.35 according to Wikipedia, Orthodox children in Jerusalem.
 So if there's 5,000 married men with their spouse and 8.34, we're at 43,000 people and everyone was healed, then he teaches.
 So that's you've got half the stories that I can see that that's the protocol and then sometimes he taught and then ministered.
 That's literally show and tell.
 Yeah.
 is literally do and then teach about what's been done.
 But the passage that you just referred to clearly says with signs following.
 Right.
 Give me off the top of your head the three biggest keys that you personally learn that
 propelled you into seeing greater healing miracles.
 And you don't have to teach about them.
 You can just talk about them because you've got a book that you've written that.
 So I think number one would be that Jesus never healed the sick as a divine person, as
 the divine son of God.
 He healed people as the son of man is what he kept calling himself.
 So if Jesus healed the sick using his divine powers, you and I cannot do that.
 Right.
 If he healed people as the son of man, and if it's true like in John's gospel where he's
 seven times says, I can do nothing by myself. I can only do what I see what I hear. If he, according
 to Philippians two, humbled himself and did not consider equality with God, something begraspt,
 but emptied himself, divested himself of his God miracles, then how did they happen? And
 they happened because he was anointed. When did he get his anointing? Well, Acts chapter 10 tells us
 He got his anointing at his baptism.
 Acts 10, 37, 38, he went around healing all because God was with him.
 So that's number one big one for me was that Jesus healed as a human being.
 And therefore I can do it because if the anointing was on his life, where did that
 come from?
 That comes from the Holy Spirit.
 How many Holy spirits have there been one?
 I got him.
 No junior Holy spirit.
 no junior, no male Holy Spirit, senior Holy Spirit,
 no Chinese Holy Spirit, Mexican Holy Spirit,
 Canadian Holy Spirit.
 Just Holy Spirit. Just Holy Spirit, one of them.
  </li><li>And so once you realize that,
 that empowered you to realize.
  </li><li>Big change.
  </li><li>Same Holy Spirit.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I'm just a vessel.
  </li><li>That's it.
 So then number two is how did Jesus do the,
 how did he actually do it?
 Because there's no teaching time of Jesus
 and the Gospels of here's how you prayed for the sick.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>He just did it and told others to do it.
 So those who were with him saw what he was doing
 more than we would see it.
 There, the stories clearly are edited versions
 that we have in the gospels.
 His talks would be more than three minutes
 that would take to read a sermon, say, in a passage.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So it's shortened down,
 but as I began to realize that it's simple,
 it's now the prayer of faith, James chapter five.
 It's commands that Jesus gives very short statements,
 a touch and a command.
 Stand up, be healed, be free.
 So that began to teach me that it really isn't about me.
 It's the longer that I pray, the more I think it's about me,
 the longer I pray, the less confident I am.
 And so let's just begin to be like Jesus
 and say something very short to the point, prayer of faith,
 and belief.
 So now the faith aspect of being convinced
 that it is God's will for everybody everywhere
 all the time to be healed.
 Bill Prankard was the one who taught me this.
 If you don't believe that God wants everybody everywhere
 all the time healed, the person in front of you right now
 is the exception.
 That's what Satan's gonna tell you.
  </li><li>Gosh.
  </li><li>So you have to believe that it is God's will for everybody.
 As demonstrated by Jesus,
 wasn't one person who left Jesus' presence that asked for healing, that left without
 being healed.
 So if Jesus only did the Father's will and not his will, well, that is God's will.
 So first one is of the three of you saying, the first one would be the revelation that
 Jesus healed in his humanity through the anointing.
 Number two is how faith works, that it's acting on revelation, its ideas, thoughts that God
 gives me and then be bold enough to act.
 And I would say number three is
 what's number three revelation?
 What about the big ones that you taught me or the ungodly beliefs related to healing?
 Basically, the explanations we've come up with for the reasons that we are on
 a hill. For example, you know what?
 It's thanks for praying for me, but actually God's teaching me something
 through this sickness or it's not God's timing.
 I mean, you did a, I mean, you've done a phenomenal job.
 Roger Sap.
 Well, I have stolen that from you who stole it from Roger Sap.
 But going through why I think we had seven of them.
 Seven. Yeah.
 Seven reasons.
 Probably much, many, many more.
 But I mean, one of the examples you gave are the 10 lepers who come to Jesus
 in the mess where we want to be cleansed.
 And Jesus doesn't say to them, you and you absolutely use not your time yet.
 You got to teach me something about your, you know, your character.
 Everyone's got to die of something.
 Right.
 You don't believe in me.
 You don't have enough faith.
 All that kind of stuff never once tried to talk anyone out of their healing, which people do.
 Christians do all the time.
 Non-Christians, Muslims don't try to talk themselves out of being healed.
 Right.
 They may not want you to minister to them in the name of Jesus, but they want to be healed.
 Right.
 Hindus want to be healed.
 Hindus have no, no problems being healed in the name of Jesus.
 They already believe that he heals.
 Right.
 Most Muslims believe that Jesus heals.
 that Christians somehow have got it in their head that God has rules and standards for
 them.
 But what do you say to people?
 This is a question we get asked a lot is I've got up for prayer hundreds of times.
 I've prayed every which way and I still haven't been healed.
 Why hasn't God healed me?
 Atomic getting in line again.
 That's it.
 Yeah.
 And it's like, I tell people that there's three problems
 and God's not one of them.
 As exemplified by Jesus,
 he healed everyone who came to him
 and everyone that he went to.
  </li><li>So what are the three problems?
  </li><li>Problem number one is the person doing the ministry.
 So Steve Long, when I'm praying for whoever it is,
 Steve's not believing, not praying to prayer of faith.
 I'm praying a wimpy prayer of doubt.
 Jesus, if it's your will, would you come and heal this person from their cancer?
 Right.
 That prayer is not going to get answered.
 Right.
 Because it's a if, it's not healing is not an if.
 Right.
 In my mind, it's a this is God's will.
 So I have now prayed a prayer doubt and doubt and unbelief stop the anointing from flowing.
 Right.
 So all sorts of believers pray prayers with no faith in them.
 So that's a big problem.
 That's problem number one.
 Problem number one.
 is the person receiving the prayer. If that person has, as you already talked about or just raised about
 ungodly beliefs that God's teaching me a lesson, God's working on my character, everyone's got to
 dive something. And so this is how I'm going to die. If you have those kinds of thoughts, you're blocking
 the Holy Spirit from coming your way. Your spirit has been told, don't let the Holy Spirit interact
 with you, body, don't let don't receive the Holy Spirit. Now no one said that, but that's what
 right what you've been lied to by Satan. And now your body believes that your
 spirit believes evolution powered by human agreement. Absolutely. And problem number three is then
 all the spiritual stuff in the middle. It's curses generational things. It's
 assaults of the enemy. It's spiritual warfare. It's all those different kind of things that we may not
 realize that are happening. So we got a person goes to bed
 anger, a Christian goes to bed angry breaks the rule from
 fusions chapter five, don't go to bed angry because you give
 Satan a foothold. And the word footholds in Greek is the word
 topos where we get topography. So I go to bed, go to bed angry.
 And I'm not forgiven, which is what I'm supposed to do. And now
 I personally, without knowing it, have given Satan access to my
 body. And now I'm trying to figure out why I'm sick. And I'm blaming other people,
 and I'm blaming people who aren't anointed and whatever the thing is when the problem is me.
 So I got all these different kinds of things. God bless Todd Bentley for all of the stuff around
 Todd. He has a great teaching Allen on 40 reasons why people don't get well. 40 reasons why Christians
 don't get well. Fascinate it. He did some outstanding research on that one and just these kind of
 You have written an amazing book on healing called My Healing Belongs to Me.
 Thank you.
 And I have read the earlier drafts of that.
 It was some of the most revelatory teaching I'd read based straight out the gospels with
 your experience of learning heelistic.
 Where can people pick up a copy of that book?
 If you have Kindle, it's on all those different kind of, you know, every platform that you
 get by a book from, you can get it.
 Oh great.
 Catch the fire website, you can get it.
 I'll put a link in the show notes to that book.
 Perfect.
 in a brand new book.
  </li><li>Two years ago wrote a book called The Faith Zone.
 And that was, I was reading the book of Matthew
 looking at the healing stories, the miracles there,
 and was fascinated how many of those stories,
 somehow there's a revelatory thought that came to people.
 The lady who's bleeding for 12 years,
 if I touch his garment,
 Jairus, who's the ruler of the synagogue in Capernaum,
 His daughter's dying.
 If you come and put your hand on her, she'll live.
 So they had a God thought.
 They acted on their God thought,
 which is what the definition of faith is.
 It's not just knowing something,
 it's the doing of what you believe.
 And so I just looked at all those stories,
 looked at Hebrews 11 with this angle
 that take the word faith out in every story
 and put in the words acting on revelation.
 And Matthew came alive to me.
 So it's a study in the book of Matthew looking at great faith, no faith, little faith, according
 to your faith, all those passages.
 And people can get them in the same place like I can put a link to the show.
 And then there was one in between that I wrote on the life of David.
 And the three years where he's running from Saul, and I call that book On the Run.
 And it's a leadership book.
 The premise of that one is why wasn't David ready to step into his role that was prophesied
 over him before he was born?
 Wow.
 Samuel spoke to Saul and said, "God's looking for a better person than you."
 Wow. David wasn't even born.
 Wow.
 So why wasn't he ready?
 And the reason is his character hadn't caught up with his anointing, hadn't caught up with his
 call on his life.
 So he had to have three years of intensive refinement.
 And coming to a bookstore sometime next year will be another one that just finished writing
 two weeks ago.
 So it's not gone to the editor yet, but it'll be starting to go through all that process.
 And the work in title, which may not be the actual title, but the work in title was Moses and me
 finding my identity. And it's looking at the 40 days, approximately 40 days from when
 the burning bush happens until they walk across the Red Sea.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Just, you can't, there's no actual chronological times in there, but we do know how many days the
 plagues lasted and those kind of things. So I'm going to guess around 40 days. And how does a
 guy like Moses go from saying no five times to God standing beside a bush that's still burning
 to becoming the reluctant leader that he was.
 Amazing, Steve. So amazing.
 Yeah.
