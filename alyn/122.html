<p> I live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones, last year.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 I'm good, how are you?<br/>
 I am doing fantastic.<br/>
 Good.<br/>
 I just-- I love today.<br/>
 It was a good day.<br/>
 It was an amazing day.<br/>
 It really was.<br/>
 Worship was Jessie Orley.<br/>
 Fantastic.<br/>
 What the heck are you supposed to do?<br/>
 I don't know.<br/>
 She's just so good.<br/>
 So good.<br/>
 I look forward to it every time she's leading.
 Oh, I just love our worship team at Grace Center.
 We have so many amazing worship leaders.
 It almost feels like we should share, but no.
 No, nobody, no, no, no.<br/>
 Keeping him.<br/>
 Josh and Sarah Parsons are doing a phenomenal job.
 They really are.<br/>
 Of raising up creative artists.<br/>
 Yes, they are.<br/>
 Do you want to comment on dancing?<br/>
 I love it that we have dancers during worship.
 Actually, I had a funny thing happen this morning.
 Was it me dancing in front of you?<br/>
 No.<br/>
 I just got caught up in the spirit.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 Elena was dancing today.<br/>
 And, but I didn't actually realize she was dancing.
 And so I came in and I had my eyes closed.
 And, you know, it was just like the normal worship team up there.
 Elena wasn't on the stage yet.<br/>
 And all of a sudden I felt like this,<br/>
 whoosh of the Holy Spirit.<br/>
 I don't know how else to explain it.<br/>
 Like just like an intensity.<br/>
 And I opened my eyes and she had just run out onto stage.
 And I was like, there she is,<br/>
 that can opener in the Holy Spirit.<br/>
 Well, I had a similar experience with that.
 I was MCing this morning, so I kicked off the service.
 And the first couple of verses of worship,
 I leaned over to Jeff and said,<br/>
 "Jeff, it feels like every reason in different places.
 Some people are greeting one another,<br/>
 some people are in worship,<br/>
 just doesn't seem like there's much traction."
 And so I said, "Do you want me to get up there
 and say something?"<br/>
 And he's like, "No, no, let's just see,
 Jesse will usually address it."<br/>
 And I had seen Elena warming up in the back.
 So I leaned over to Jeff.<br/>
 I said, actually Elena's dancing.<br/>
 I bet you when she comes out, you know, shift stuff.
 Meanwhile, I saw Shannon what passed.<br/>
 So I had a dream that I needed to Shannon to interpret.
 So I said, Shannon, can I pop out into the hallway?
 I just need to give you this download.
 So we went into the hallway about a minute later,
 I came back in and worship had totally shifted.
 You know, what I'd felt before where not everybody
 was together.<br/>
 It was full on worship and up there was Elena dancing.
 So yay, Elena, yay, our dance community,
</p><ul>
  <li>Yay, Josh and Sarah, yay, Grace and her.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think the dancing is a huge ad.
 And again, we're so blessed to have
 super anointed dancers, which is fantastic.
  </li><li>It's amazing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>All right, that wasn't even in our notes,
 that was just off the top of her head.
  </li><li>Freestyle and, freestyle and.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>You're welcome.
  </li><li>All right.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Litre of your week.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Sorry.
  </li><li>No, don't apologize.
  </li><li>I mean me.
 I love the old hip hop legend.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>There's a mixed master AJ coming back
 from the Canadian roots.
  </li><li>What?
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>All right, we taught healing like sorts this week
 at school.
  </li><li>We did.
  </li><li>Which is actually what we're gonna be talking about
 on this podcast.
  </li><li>Oh cool.
  </li><li>We'll leave it there, but nevertheless,
 we introduce our students to a whole lot of concepts
 and tools for inner healing.
  </li><li>I sometimes, I just snorted.
 (laughs)
 I sometimes feel bad for them.
 like the ones that aren't necessarily from our church
 and this is all new information,
 'cause you can tell that they're in heavy process mode
 by Tuesday when they're like,
 "And now we have to learn about what?"
  </li><li>Well, I feel for them too,
 'cause I remember the first time I learned all this stuff
 where I was like, wait, what now?
 But on the one hand, you're relieved
 because what you're hearing helps your life make sense,
 but in another sense, you're overwhelmed
 because no sooner have you wrapped your head
 around one concept and you feel like the Holy Spirit
 you're talking on your heart, you're on to the next topic.
 And more than once, when I was teaching this week,
 I'd look out at our audience and you could just see them
 like wide eyes like, "What?"
  </li><li>At one point I looked at it and they actually had
 their mouths open, there were several of them in a row,
 just with their mouths open, staring at me.
 Like I just said something like,
 "I'm gonna give you a million dollars."
  </li><li>Well done, SOC students for persevering with us.
  </li><li>They're doing great.
  </li><li>I had my own level of inner healing this week.
  </li><li>You did.
  </li><li>Well, it was more dental inner healing.
 Did I mention this on your mouth?
 feeling that my I'm getting some crowns put in and so I had some temporary
 crowns but they got stuck in a burrito I was eating so I had to go see that
 happened I don't know I wasn't there oh yes you were so wait a minute you had a
 burrito oh so good you want to hear remember you left me to my own devices
 no but you're still supposed to make good decisions I did but the burrito just
 started going burritos come here so I went to choose and had a burrito with
 And it was delicious except for the fat.
 And my dentist said, this is why burritos pull crowns out because you bite into it in that soft gooey dough.
 In cases, the whole top of the crown.
 Interesting that this is the first time I'm hearing about how it actually came out.
 OK, you just can tell me on air so I can't say anything.
 Is that what the plan was?
 Or did you just forget?
 I didn't know.
 You're like, Oh, shouldn't have mentioned the burrito.
 OK.
 OK, I know.
  </li><li>You bite into it.
  </li><li>And it encases the whole crown,
 and when you lift up, it sucks out,
 and that's exactly what happened.
 So Tuesday afternoon, my amazing dentist fit me in
 and numbed me up and put it back on,
 and he cemented the down good and proper,
 and all the breeders have eaten since then,
 it stayed put, so that's great.
  </li><li>Not funny.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Not funny.
 I also had big news, but not anything to do
 with my teeth, I believe.
  </li><li>You've got too lots of big news.
 I do. I switched my iPhone 7 for a 7 plus because of the camera.
 Didn't we start discussing this last week? I would like some sort of public on-on-air
 recognition for the whole use switching to the iPhone 7 plus.
 What kind of recognition do you want? You got a 7 plus. I looked at it.
 No. It was a great camera. So I said I want one and I went and switched mine in.
 Oh, how we've rewritten it.
 (laughing)
 When the iPhone 7 was launched.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I showed you the highlights of the announcement.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I said to you, babe, you're probably gonna want the camera
 but you didn't wanna have to wait
 and you thought that my phone was too big and too ugly.
  </li><li>It wasn't that I didn't wanna have to wait.
 It was, 'cause we didn't know we were gonna have to wait.
 It was just that I was worried that it was too big a phone
 and you said it probably is too big a phone.
  </li><li>But I said you're gonna want that camera.
 I'm telling you right now you're gonna want that camera.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 listen to me, but it was much emphasis.
 You also said it was too big a phone.
 So it was a confusing message.
 I want to hear you say, babe, I'm sorry.
 I didn't listen.
 I'm so sorry.
 I didn't listen to you now that I have that on tape.
 You're just going to like replay it or just add it into our podcast.
 I'm just going to use it as my ringtone.
 Yeah, babe.
 I'm so sorry.
 I didn't listen to you.
 While I've got you in that mode, could you repeat after me a few other choice?
 No.
 Hey, hot stuff.
 No.
 Why don't we slip into something more comfortable?
 No.
 No.
 I'm not giving it any more ammunition.
 Anyway, I just loved your insistence that the Holy Spirit was going to work out.
 For those of you who keep track of these things, it's very, very difficult to get iPhone
 7 Plus's, especially on T-Mobile because they're the only devices unlocked.
 Yes.
 So people want to buy it even if they're not on T-Mobile.
 And there was no iPhone 7 pluses for days and days and days.
 And you only had a 14 day return period.
 Yeah.
 And I returned it on day 14.
 Well, on day 14, I said, "A babe, I've been checking since like day 11, 12, 13, there
 are none."
 Yeah.
 And I've just found a black one.
 And what did you say?
 I said, "Well, I don't want a black one.
 I want a white one."
 You're like, "Well, baby, you might have to settle for a black one if you want to get
 it today because this is the last day to exchange it."
 And what did you say?
 I said, "I think God knows me and he knows that I want a white one and he's a God of the details.
 So I'm going to just keep waiting."
 So I rolled my eyes.
 You did. And you're like, "Fine. You're probably going to keep your seven." And I went to sleep.
 Just rest. Resting in your sun, shit.
 I was totally fine.
 And then an hour later, I woke you up and said, "I found a rose gold one for you exactly
 when you want. Go over it."
 Yes. Drive, drive woman, drive. And I went and got it.
 So, and then your drop zone, talk about your drop zone.
 I am making a drop zone or a mudroom, as some people call them.
 I'd never heard of either of those phrases.
 Explain the concept like we don't know what a drop zone or a mudroom is.
 It looks kind of like a wood locker.
 So there's baskets that go below a bench that you can put like shoes in or whatever.
 And then there's some, I'm using white bead board and some trim and stuff.
 and then there's hooks for their knapsacks or backpacks or whatever you want to call it,
 depending on where you're from, and lunch boxes and that sort of thing. And then there's a shelf
 above where you put more baskets that might have gloves or scarves or that sort of thing.
 It's basically for our back hallway, isn't it?
 Yes.
 And all the kids' backpacks from school and all that sort of scarves hat.
 Yeah. I ripped apart a closet that had two sliding doors on it and ripped the frame
 out of it and everything and then build it.
  </li><li>The very day that we moved in,
 the first day we moved in, you ripped it out.
  </li><li>I was committed to the idea
 and I thought if I don't rip it out now,
 then it's possible that thing will get used
 to something else and I didn't want that to happen.
  </li><li>Your dedication is amazing.
 And what else has been happening?
 You've been using your power tools like nobody's business.
  </li><li>I have been, so my miter saw is set up on its stand
 and it's perfect and I love the laser.
 It's very good and I used my Brad Naylor
 for the first time today and I used mine.
  </li><li>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
 What is a Brad Naylor?
 I'm a brad nailer is it now gun shoots nails so cool so I do not want to mess with you
 and I used my circular saw I attached the saw blade and did all that stuff myself and
 what else did I use today that I hadn't used before nothing because I'd use the drill in
 the compact driver and all that.
 I love seeing you in your happy place you're you're so content and you're you're physically
 jumping up and down all giddy.
 It's so fun.
 With excitement.
 I love it.
 I love it too.
 I just love seeing you happy.
 What are you going to build next?
 I want to build a new kitchen table.
 Even though we have a kitchen table?
 Yeah.
 I mean, the kitchen table we have is totally 70s.
 And...
 Well, you do not exaggerate because it was bought in the 70s.
 It was literally bought in the 70s.
 It was stored in an old barn for about 20 years.
 And as much...
 I just don't like it.
 So I want to just make a farm table, which isn't hard to do.
 So let's do it.
 Let's do it.
 like a pro. Thank you. Our friends and in Lorna right from Scotland,
 that's right. They did. I'm having fun introducing them to all my American friends who think that
 I have a Scottish accent because and in Lorna have got a whole new level of Scottish accent.
 They really do. And I've been getting a tune up on all the Scottish words I forgot existed.
 Right. Like hen and bern and morn. Bern. And what else do they say? Just I need to I need
 I need to write them down.
 I will make a list of the things they say
 and open next week's podcast with them.
 We have some listeners feedback.
  </li><li>Cool.
  </li><li>You know how last week we were talking,
 we did some question and answers
 and Neil had written in and he was talking about
 what's the balance between thankfulness and expecting more
 and we were like, "Ah, here's our best thinking so far."
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And we just said, "If anybody else has got some ideas,"
 well, Rachel wrote in and said this, it's brilliant.
 I haven't added this,
 I'm just reading it straight from her email.
 says it seems to me that sometimes when we are unfamiliar with God's goodness, before
 we settle in our hearts that He is more than enough, we must first address the truth that
 He is enough. We must journey through the valleys and find for ourselves that in our
 current circumstances even the bad ones, if we look closely, He is enough is everywhere.
 And so we can live in a constant state of gratitude for who He is and what He is given.
 Without that foundation, I think it's very difficult to grasp as extravagance.
 With that foundation, it becomes clear that we can both revel in today's enough and look
 expectantly for tomorrow's more than enough, all the tomorrow's building on each other.
 Yeah, that's great.
 That's a great answer.
 Really good.
 Thanks, Rachel.
 So, Neil, Rachel had a better answer than we did, and that's the joy of the Internet.
 Our topic for this week is Inner Healing.
 Yay.
 that we were at a conference, do you remember this? And we'd finished speaking. And somebody
 came up to us and they said, "Are you pastors?" "Yes, I remember this." I'm not even going to
 say, "Yes, yes we are." They're like, "No, no, are you full-time pastors?" "Yep." I mean,
 like you pastor people at a church. Yeah. And the next question was, "Why are you so happy?"
 And I thought that was a really, really telling question. We later as we got to know this person
 realized she'd been around a lot of ministries and I think our level of joy was not the norm
 that she'd seen in people who do what we do. And so she asked us, how do you stay so happy?
 I think the answer to the gator was just two things. One, chocolate.
 No, we said one is the revelation of the father's love. And the second is we've learned the
 ability to say no without any sort of squirming or hesitancy.
 Yeah.
 But I would like to add a third.
 And I would say that the third reason that there is a lot of joy in our hearts is
 this whole premise of inner healing.
 And we will teach it on this this week.
 So in our healing is basically, well, let me read you a couple of verses.
 Proverbs four, 23 says, guard your heart above all else for it determines the
 course of your life.
 Right. So Solomon, the wisest person in the whole world is saying like the most important thing,
 everything that's going to flow out of and everything that's going to direct the course of
 your life is your heart, your emotional well-being. Yeah. And I see so many people who are surviving
 life rather than allowing Jesus to help heal any areas of their heart that have been damaged
 through life. Right. Or even thriving. What do you mean? Well, you know, you're saying,
 well, I see so many people that are just, they're just surviving as opposed to God healing your
 heart. You can even get stuck at just being like, okay, I'm healed now. I'm not surviving. I'm just,
 you know, plotting along. Well, I think that God actually wants us to be thriving. You know,
 we're actually taking ground and full of joy and excited about life.
 What do you think keeps us from thriving?
 I think unforgiveness, when I've had seasons where I've been bogged down with unforgiveness
 or bitterness or just not wanting to deal with the stuff in my heart that God wants to
 deal with and actually kind of wanting to blame everybody else instead of deal with it
 myself, I would say I definitely was not thriving in those seasons or even moving forward because
 you just kind of sit there in your funk until you're actually willing to deal and, you know,
 work through your stuff with God. Right. I think the issue is,
 I remember listening to John on it talk about inner healing and he said,
 "When Carol began to introduce the concept of needing her heart's healed,
 he didn't think he needed it. He was just like, 'Well, I'm not a basket case. I gap in the morning.
 I have a job. I can put pants on.' And he felt that like inner healing was reserved for the
 the non-functioning members of our society.
 Like, well, I could see why those people
 would need some special care, but I'm good.
 And I think there's a danger that we think we're just good.
 Like, I'm fine, I'm good.
 And usually, when we're like that,
 there's been a deadening of pain in our hearts
 because all of us, because we live in the fallen world,
 we've all been disappointed, we've all been hurt,
 we've probably experienced rejection,
 we've probably heard lies,
 We've not been able to escape being hurt or wounded emotionally, disappointed, let down,
 frustrated, envious. All the things that Jesus came to heal. And if we're not careful, if we don't
 acknowledge that our heart has been hurt by those things, we dead in our heart so that the pain no
 longer hurts. And I lived like that for a long time thinking, no, I'm fine. It's just everybody
 else is over emotional. Right. Right. Like you, the right amount of fine.
 I'm the right amount of fine.
 I mean, look at all these flaky people crying at movies or look at all these people who
 are so over emotional, what's wrong with them?
 But not realizing, oh, my heart is actually hurt and I've talked myself out with being
 hurt.
 Right.
 Right.
 And we, so we develop really sophisticated skills for dealing with hurt.
 Yeah.
 Give me some, give me some skills that we typically employ to make things no longer hurt.
 You mean if we don't want to use inner healing or we don't want to have a whole eating disorders,
 watching lots of Netflix, whatever it is, escapism.
 Right, but what about some more acceptable forms?
 A hyper-religious activity.
 I'll just start with that one.
 Just performance, avoidance, withdrawal, and all of those things are us in our own efforts
 building strong towers of defense to keep pain out.
 And sometimes I think as Christians, we feel like, well, I was bought with a price and I've heard people say things like this.
 I was bought with a price and so I no longer have a right to feel how I feel.
 But the thing is you do feel how you feel.
 If you don't acknowledge it and give it to God, then you can't get healed of it.
 But you're just we're spending all day long trying to shove it down and pretend it isn't there.
 Well, we're talking ourselves out of it.
 Right.
 and your head will lie to you, but your body will not.
 So eventually what happens is your body collapses
 under the pressure of it.
 I think, you know, what I've learned,
 and is that the walls that we build to protect our hearts
 from pain, we might not even acknowledge is there,
 is very effective at keeping people in pain out.
 But the downside to that, it's also very effective
 at keeping the love of God out.
 Now we struggle with that because we know the verses
 says what shall separate us from the love of God. Well, and it goes on unless, you know,
 principalities and powers and etc. But if we haven't allowed the Holy Spirit to woo our
 heart, well, there's actually a deadening of our heart where we can't feel his affection.
 It's not that he's withheld his affection. He's absolutely wanting to love us with an
 everlasting love and does. It's just that we're not very good recipients of that. And
 We don't know how to feel his heart.
 I was going to say, "Hey, do you remember that one time you got divorced?"
 Yeah, I remember that one time.
 Thanks for bringing it up.
 No, just kidding.
 No, but I remember you because I've heard you teach in this a lot and you use this great
 example that when your first husband left you, Carol was just like, "Hey, how are you
 doing?
 How are you doing?
 And what was your response?"
 I was like, "Oh, yeah, I'm good.
 I've totally forgiven him and I'm really good.
 And it was like three days after he left.
  </li><li>Now, obviously we can chartle at that now.
 But when that happened in those three days,
 were you honestly believing in your head,
 I'm totally fine, I'm totally good.
  </li><li>Yeah, I totally was.
 I actually think now looking back, I was numb.
 I was in trauma and I was numb.
 And so I believed I was okay
 because I wasn't bawling my eyes out,
 but I probably wasn't bawling my ass out
 because I was numb.
  </li><li>'Cause you just shut down your heart to feeling pain.
  </li><li>Yeah, I was like, okay, I know how to survive agony.
 I've done this before, and so this is what I do.
  </li><li>And how long did it take before the Holy Spirit was like,
 "Hey, honey, you're doing a great job at surviving,
 "but I never called you to live a life of survival."
  </li><li>Well, before he started saying that,
 before I started listening and taking him up on his invitation,
 'cause probably those are two different time periods.
 Right, but how long did you survive in survival mode?
 And what caused you to get out of that?
  </li><li>I probably on some level,
 stayed in that for about three years.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>So convincing yourself, I'm totally good.
 What's your problem?
  </li><li>Well, you know, I was having a series of dreams
 thinking I was totally fine and totally good.
 And then the Lord showed me my heart.
 And that was about three, three and a half years after.
 Do you want to talk with that?
 Yeah, it's fine.
 I just, I wasn't sure if I told this story or not on the podcast, but I had a series
 of dreams after he left and there was 16 of them that all of them within two to three
 days I would hear that exactly what I had dreamt had happened.
 And I would either hear that from friends that were still my friends and his friends,
 Or sometimes he would phone either in the beginning that was mostly because of finances
 or stuff like that.
 And I was kind of foolish enough to go, "I know you're at such and such a place with
 a girl named whatever."
 And he would be like, "Were you having me followed?
 You're having me followed."
 And I just knew all this information from dreams.
 And then the Lord said, "That's not why I'm telling you those dreams, so stop doing that."
 And I was like, "Okay."
 I just was praying, because I was like, "I guess you're showing me what he's doing so that I could
 pray." And so I prayed for three and a half years for it to be restored, for our relationship to be
 restored. But I didn't really realize I wasn't dealing with the stuff in my heart. I was turning
 it into an intercession festival, but I wasn't really giving God opportunity.
 And you're thinking, "Look at what a strong Christian I am. Oh my gosh, I'm brilliant."
 Totally killing it.
 Yeah, I am totally awesome.
 I feel no pain.
 I'm just praying for him.
 Oh, Lord, I mean, the poor fellow.
 But what was going on?
 I realized at about three and a half years, I had the 17th dream.
 And after all 16 dreams, literally all 16 of them had been confirmed that those were actual things.
 Events.
 I started realizing that God might be actually speaking to me about things.
 And then in the 17th dream, I dreamt that he married her, my friend that he had left me for,
 and that they had a son, and then one of them died. And I woke up, it was like three or three
 30 in the morning, I woke up and sat straight up in bed because I knew that the Lord had shown me
 my heart, that even though I was saying, Lord, I forgive them, there was part of my heart that
 was saying, well, I forgive them, but I know that justice is yours and you're going to get them for
 everything they're doing to me. Like there's part of my heart that was still looking for payback.
 And so that was probably the first morning that I just fully released them. And I remember the
 Lord saying to me, what if they never apologize? What if they never come back and say they were sorry?
 You still forgive them. And I was like, yeah, I do. But I mean, it was three and a half years of
 Hiding from my heart and kind of hiding from the Holy Spirit and I just didn't realize I was doing it
 I thought I was doing really well and so once you realized oh
 You know once you realize that were you then in touch with the pain of your heart I?
 Think
 Well, it's hard to it's hard to know whether it was because of that prayer or
 I remember the following morning waking up and the Lord said to me. I want you to stop
 Praying for this now like stop praying that I'm gonna restore the marriage. He said I'm going to restore your story another way
 What was that other way?
 Handsome Scott's yeah was right now
 But the amazing thing about that was like an hour and hour and a half later
 He phoned and I hadn't heard from him in like a year and a half
 And he phoned and he said I've asked to marry me. She said yes, whatever and and I was able to just stay calm
 Because the Lord had totally prepped my heart for everything, you know, so I was like, all right
 So I remember crying, you know after I got off the phone
 So it's hard to say I think it all sort of happened at once, you know, just sort of going okay God
 I'm gonna have to really really really really give this to you now right as opposed to part of it being mind to fix through
 intense intercession
 Right, you know, but the net effect of what God's done in your heart and we're using a really big example here of the healing life
 So of the pain of divorce. Yeah, so you know, no, that that's a really really big example
 But my point in asking you about that is
 Several times come away from a conference or an event and I'm like, hey, you know, how was that?
 And you're like, man, it was really rough
 I was just you know the end of this conference I was praying for a lady and she just came up for prayer and my heart
 really went out to her because she just found out that her husband is left her and he says
 somebody else to marry her and man I can't even imagine what that would feel like.
 And you're being totally sincere. You're not being flippant and I'm like,
 that happened to you and you're like, oh yeah, oh yeah, it totally did. And the Lord has done such
 a work in healing your heart that that no longer has any residue left in your heart.
 Yeah, there's no pain. There's no power behind any of those memories. I mean,
 It's I on a regular basis, forget that I ever went through that.
 That's ridiculous.
 Yeah.
 But it is the nature of God to he wasn't joking when it says he carried your
 sicknesses and your infirmities upon him.
 Right.
 And that, you know, he carried your sorrows.
 He's really serious, but the the difficulties, I think, because we've not
 been taught well, we think that our sorrow are ours to we confuse the cross
 that we're supposed to carry with are the very things that Jesus has paid for.
 I think it makes me sad too because there's so many Christians that are living in pain
 and they're sort of so defined by their testimonies and by the things that they've been through.
 And they basically feel like, well, this is what life looks like until I die.
 Like I carry this level of pain or residue or being attached to all the things that I've
 been through and that's not life abundant. That's not what Jesus died for us to live in.
 You can be totally free of it. But it's not free of it by name it and claim it or shout
 scripture versus that. It's by actually lying down on that God-it-do-heart surgery and let
 him work on the stuff that we're fighting from.
 To be fair, there is a place where you are using scripture to combat what you're feeling.
 But life can't be about denying what you're feeling
 while declaring truth that aren't real to you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like that's certainly the pathway
 to getting breakthroughs.
  </li><li>Sure.
 Well, I mean, it's like when somebody suffers a loss
 and people don't know what to say
 and so you just throw scripture versus that.
 And it's like, actually, it's okay for that person
 to mourn and to grieve and God made us to do it that way,
 and you don't have to short circuit that
 throwing scripture at it at some point, that's going to be really helpful. It's just not at this
 moment right now. I think we're out of touch with our hearts on how we've thought that feelings
 are our enemy. I remember, and I've told the story so many times, forgive me if you've heard it before,
 but I remember I've talked about my breakdown when I was 21, but this happened a couple years
 later that I was no longer afflicted with the horrible, horrible feelings of depression and despair,
 But I would say that I was quote unquote in my right mind, but I was suffering terribly from
 panic attacks and anxiety attacks. And I remember my solution was to write down verses that dealt
 with fear and I put them in a jar and I called that jar the anti-fear pills. And when I'd wake
 up in the middle of the night, just rack the sweat and full on panic, I'd grab one of these
 verses and read it out loud. And I would find peace in that. But I remember one time that was
 happening. I remember saying to the Lord, Lord, I refuse to believe that this was the quality of
 life you had in mind when you hung on a cross for me. Because in John 10, 10, it says,
 you can't make life in life abundantly. I'm barely living life. I don't even know what abundant
 life would look like. And I think I was doing the best I could with the revelation I had.
 And that's true of all of us. We walk in the light of the revelation we've received.
 And so why I so love the message of the healing of our hearts is this promise that Jesus came to heal the broken heart.
 He came to bind up those who are crushed in spirit.
 And he really does mean that he really does mean that he has a solution to the brokenness in our hearts that we're trying to manage in our own best efforts.
 efforts. I love that verse in Isaiah that says that a bruised really would not break and a
 smoldering wick he would not snuff out. And I remember feeling like that. I remember just
 feeling so broken and so worthless and so useless that I even questioned the point of living,
 the point of my life. And I just love that the Lord is in the business of finding broken people
 and loving them back to life. And it saddens me that there's portions of the church that try to
 convince us that we don't need it. You know, some of the verses I was brought up to believe
 2 Corinthians 5, 17, for example. I mean, it sounded like I no longer believe it. I was duped
 by this verse in the Bible, don't I? I still believe it, but my belief in it is slightly different
 from what I was raised in. So 2 Corinthians 5, 17 says this, "Therefore, if anyone is in
 Christ, he's a new creation. All things have passed away, behold, all things have become new."
 And that's the verse that people would use, or one of them at least to say, "Hey, you know,
 You don't need to deal with the past, you don't need to deal with it.
 It's, "Hey, you're all good and you're all great."
 That verse is absolutely true in Scripture.
 We absolutely are new creations and it's amazing.
 But we have old habit structures that would lie to us that were like what we weren't.
 And we still are affected.
 It would seem in my own life in the lives of many other people were affected by the residues
 of old ways of thinking.
 And so we need the Holy Spirit to just come and unhook us from bad ways of thinking and
 heal our heart from any residue that the hurts have left, that things we haven't given to
 him, for example.
 Yeah, for sure.
 Have you ever wondered what causes well-meaning Christians to completely derail their lives?
 You've seen it time and time again. I'm a mega Christian. Unfortunately, in the public eye,
 an expos&Atilde;&copy; comes out that they've been doing drugs or that they're cheating on their wife or
 whatever. Have you ever thought to think about why that is? How does that happen? Because no
 Christian wakes up in the morning, it's like, "You know what? Today would be a great day to derail my
 life." No, of course not. But I also think I wonder if a lot of people, particularly that are in full
 time ministry tend to think that they're not allowed to have things that they need
 in or healing for, they're not allowed to have things that they're struggling with.
 And so if you're not allowed to have those things, then you're not allowed to deal with
 them either, not allowed to ask for help.
 I remember talking to a group of friends of mine a number of years ago who had all been
 told in Bible college, make sure, you know, like they were all going to be pastors and
 and stuff and they're like, make sure you always appear to be perfect.
 You always appear to have everything together.
 Never let anybody from your congregation know if you have any problems or struggles.
 Everything was shame and hiddenness.
 And that's what they were trained to do at Bible College.
 That's a recipe for fruitfulness.
 And you're just like, dude, they trained you to fail because you can't be perfect.
 And you do need help.
 part of being part of a family is that we all help each other and walk through things together.
 So I often wonder, I think people who at whatever point in their road end up sabotaging their walk,
 probably at some point they started believing lies about either God not being able to heal them or
 you know. Or ignoring the need for healing. Right. There's a great verse in song Solomon
 215 says, "Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that ruin the vineyards or vineyards
 are in bloom." There's a danger when our vineyards of life that are in bloom when everything's going
 well, it seems ridiculous to stop and catch one little fox. Like, what does it matter?
 Like, the whole vineyard there, sure, go have some grapes. And I think that verse is talking about
 the little things that the Holy Spirit puts our His finger on. Like, "Hey, you're being a little
 bit negative or that judgment doesn't suit you well or hey bitterness is not the look you're going
 for or hey that thought you're letting that thought run around your head way too long why
 you take it captive to Christ see what happens yeah and I think that when we leave those little foxes
 unchecked they will ruin the vineyard yeah and I think that's the outworking that we've seen so
 So I love that we have a church culture that not just endorses, but encourages and is active
 in the pursuit of the healing of not just the members, but the leaders.
 I love that Jeff and Becky, the elders that are bored.
 I love that our staff go after stuff.
 I love that the vast majority of our staff and our leaders at Grace and I've gone on
 healing weeks.
 I love that it is not weird to say, "Oh, I'm going to be out this day.
 I'm going to go, I'm going to go get some ministry.
 Like it is not shocking to our staff
 that I've just booked three ministry appointments
 in the coming weeks.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Everybody loves it.
 There's no sense of like, oh my gosh, what's wrong?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>They're probably relieved there.
 I just love the pursuit of the application
 of what Christ has done for us.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I love it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I think it's amazing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And I mean, the freedom in that is that you don't have
 stay stuck and you don't have to live in shame. You can actually say, "Hey, you know what? I need help."
 When something is too big for you, it's okay that it's too big for you. You don't have to have
 all the answers. Inner healing has made me a better father, a better husband, a better pastor.
 It's pretty much made me a better person. I love it. In any areas where I'm not as good as I want
 to be, I am committed to allowing the Holy Spirit to put His finger on my heart and deal
 with anything that He would like rather than run away from it and do sin management or
 hide and shame.
 I've tried that.
 It's just a miserable way of life.
 Here we are talking about this.
 What do you encourage our listeners who are not part of a culture like this?
 They're listening going, "Oh, well, I would like some inner healing.
 What would you suggest to them?"
 Well, there's a number of, I guess they're called,
 paraministries that you could go to
 that are not necessarily associated with a specific church
 that you could get some inner healing from.
 So we've gone to restoring the foundations,
 which is started by Betsy and Chester Kaelstra.
  </li><li>They're all over the world?
  </li><li>They're all over the world, literally.
 There's teams all over the world.
 And I think the website for that is,
 is it restoringyourlife.com or?
 I don't know if you check the show notes.
 I've got a link to restoring foundations website.
  </li><li>There's another ministry called HeartSync,
 which I think is also,
 they're raising up teams all over the place.
 I'm not sure if they're quite all over the world yet,
 but HeartSync is an amazing tool,
 amazing type of ministry.
 And they're also great.
 We've done that for ourselves.
 But babe, I'm trying to think about what could we offer,
 or what could we talk about for people
 that can't access either one of those things.
  </li><li>Well, I think that my first encounter
 within her healing with Jesus himself,
 I remember Jesus coming to me one day
 into my bedroom and just dialoguing with me.
 And basically the Lord just had me go through a list
 of sins that I was trying to ignore or forget.
 The Lord was like, "No, I'd like you to write them out
 on a piece of paper and I'd like you to just pray
 through them with me right now."
 And as I did that in a vision,
 I saw the Lord come and kiss me on the forehead every sin that I confess.
 And I've never struggled with the memory of those sins since.
 Yeah.
 Like he just came and settled it.
 It wasn't that my sins weren't forgiven before then.
 It was that my heart hadn't received the forgiveness.
 And so just him showing up.
 So the Holy Spirit is the great healer.
 He is so good.
 And there are times where you would be astonished at what the Holy Spirit will do.
 if you just give him half an hour to just lie down the floor and soak and allow him to bring up whatever he wants to bring.
 I mean, one of the prayers I love to pray all the time is Psalm 139, which says, "Search me, O God.
 Know my heart.
 Test me.
 Know my anxious thoughts.
 See if there's any offensive way in me and lead me in the way of our lasting."
 If you pray that with an expectant heart and you will allow the Holy Spirit to take you where you need to go,
 the Holy Spirit is so good at coming to your heart and saying, "Hey,
 I'd love this back.
 Hey, I'd love to take this anxiety.
 Hate none, this doesn't belong to you.
 I actually paid for on the cross 2000 years ago.
 Hey, let me take this anxiety.
 Let me take this heavy load off you.
 If we would spend more time yielding to the Holy Spirit
 and less time defending that we don't need him,
 I certainly in my life I would have been way better off.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>So here's the thing, what I'm so encouraged by is
 we never need to dig in the gardens of our soul.
 It's not us that dig stuff up.
 God is so good at coming alongside saying,
 "Hey, can I help you with that?
 Hey, could I help you with this?"
 I just love that.
 Do you wanna pray for our listeners right now?
 Just if anybody's feeling unsettled,
 let's just pray peace over them.
  </li><li>Yeah, Father, I thank you that you are
 a healer of people, that you, your heart towards us
 is that we would have lives that are full,
 that not only represent you well,
 but that we are kids who know that we're loved.
 Lord, I ask that you would give us courage
 to deal with anything we're running away from.
 Lord, anything that we've shoved down for years, Lord,
 would you in your faithfulness bring up
 each thing in the right timing
 and help us as we endeavor to walk through things
 that may have felt overwhelming or scary.
 Lord, would you place people around every single one of us,
 every single person listening that are safe and lovely?
 And would you place people around them that have tools to help them walk
 through this stuff that is bogging down their lives?
 Lord, I know that your heart is that we would live free, that we would have
 lives that are thriving, that are full of you, that are abundant.
 And Lord, I ask that you would do in us whatever needs to be done in order to get us there.
 Yeah, Lord, we, we just forgive any person that taught us to shove things down or to just survive.
 Lord, I ask that you would make this journey into your fullness so wonderful for every single person listening God.
 I thank you that you're amazing.
 And we just say thank you in advance
 for what you're gonna do in each life.
 In Jesus name, amen.
  </li><li>Amen.
