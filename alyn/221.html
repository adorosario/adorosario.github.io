<p> I live in AJ's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Hey, we're back.<br/>
 And this time we're looking at the camera.
 We are.<br/>
 We're looking at the camera, but we can also look at each other.
 So that feels better because that's what I'm used to.
 So I can do like, like Jim in the office looks at the camera like,
 when you say something, is that what's going to happen?
 No, no, because you know, you always just want to look at me
 with big love hearts in your eyes.<br/>
 That's it.<br/>
 That's very nice.
</p><ul>
  <li>Last week we noticed when we watched it back,
 we actually had some other cameras set up
 that we were trying to look at and prioritize
 and then those cameras didn't work.
 So we realized our main camera, we didn't look at it once.
 So sorry if you felt a little bit lost,
 but our goal is to be looking at each other.
  </li><li>Yeah, because it's weird to be talking to each other
 and then not actually looking at each other.
 So we'll probably go back and forth between looking at each other
 and looking at y'all.
  </li><li>What's weird is when you look at me
 and dress me with your eyes.
 I can't help myself darling.
  </li><li>But we have an audience there.
  </li><li>Oh, okay.
 I'll try and make sure I keep his clothes on.
  </li><li>We're back.
 I hope you all had a good week.
 Babe, how was your week?
  </li><li>It was good.
 It was full as a full week.
 Lots of Zoom calls.
  </li><li>So many Zoom calls.
  </li><li>So many Zoom calls.
 I was getting to the end of the day,
 each day and thinking,
 I feel like my eyes have gone square
 from looking at a screen.
 Yeah.
 Do you know what the highlight my week was?
  </li><li>What was the highlight?
  </li><li>The lunch that you made me today.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>Yeah, grain-free bagel with cari gold butter.
  </li><li>Yum.
  </li><li>With a fried egg, with cheese, with bacon,
 and with some sort of delicious avocado guacamole type thing.
  </li><li>Well, here's the funny part about that.
  </li><li>Oh God, was it all breast milk?
 (laughs)
  </li><li>No, the avocado wasn't actually ripe
 and I had already cut into it,
 so I just put it in a mixer with my special mayonnaise
 until it was smooth enough that you can do all of it.
 (laughs)
 And then you're all like, this is the best thing
 I've ever made. - It was so good.
 It was so delicious. - Oh good.
  </li><li>I had one of those weird things where I went to text AJ,
 but I actually texted somebody completely different.
 And so texted this man in California saying,
 "This was the best sandwich you've ever made me."
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Well, there's that. - Did he say,
 "Thank you, I think."
  </li><li>Yeah, I don't know.
 I haven't checked to see what he was on.
 Hey, thanks everybody for tuning in on Wednesday.
 Did we do a hang?
 Yeah, we did a round-life hang.
 And it was fun to be with everybody.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was really fun.
  </li><li>Thank you.
 We felt less lonely, hope you had a good time.
 We're gonna do that again this week,
 but we realized we kind of left all our European friends
 out in the cold because we did it so late in the day.
  </li><li>Oh, sorry.
  </li><li>Yeah, we're gonna move it back a little bit.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>When are we gonna do it?
  </li><li>We're gonna do it Wednesday at noon,
 Central Standard Time, which will be 6 p.m. British time.
  </li><li>Okay, did you already check my calendar
 that I don't have anything?
  </li><li>I did, but I can never trust your calendar, so.
  </li><li>I'll just check it right now
 while you say something clever.
  </li><li>Okay, you check it while I--
  </li><li>Just so that we can like clarify this.
  </li><li>We'll do something clever.
  </li><li>Yeah, actually our topic this week came out
 of the Instagram Live that we did with y'all.
 You were all asking some great questions.
 And so we're about to start a nine episode series
 all about feelings.
 I know we've talked a little bit about feelings before,
 but this is gonna go into in depth.
 Over to our calendar correspondent is--
  </li><li>I can do that as long as I don't wanna eat lunch
 because I have a meeting up until 12 and then one at one o'clock.
  </li><li>So we'll bring our lunch,
 we'll have a pack lunch on Instagram live,
 you bring your lunch and we'll do--
  </li><li>That sounds fair.
  </li><li>That's a lunch date with all of our listeners.
  </li><li>See, we'll have lunch together.
  </li><li>It's gonna be beautiful.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So we're gonna be talking about feelings.
 AJ, talk to me about talking about feelings.
  </li><li>Well, talk to you about talking about feelings.
 I think I really thought
 that I was great at feeling my feelings,
 not necessarily identifying them quickly,
 but I thought, oh yeah, I feel my feelings
 and all that kind of stuff until I went to that Sage Hill weekend
 where we did some training on feeling your feelings.
 And I started having a revelation that
 I wasn't really feeling all of my feelings.
 I was just trying to feel the appropriate ones.
  </li><li>And by appropriate you mean?
  </li><li>Happy feelings.
 Good, good feelings and I guess it's okay to feel sad, but it's certainly not a fit.
 Okay to feel angry or lonely or you know, so as we were on the weekend and they were
 defining all of these different feelings and saying, no, they're all good because God
 gave you all these feelings.
 I was having a hard time getting my head around that and then realizing, Oh gosh, actually
 run from my feelings a lot if they're not the right ones.
 Wow, so you're judging your feelings or you were yeah, you're trying to start them out into right feelings and bad feelings
 Yeah, well most feelings probably felt bad
 So we had it was so funny being with everybody on on Wednesday and actually it's this has been the same thing that we've experienced all this week
 Really is when we're with people we're asking them like hey, what do you need and people are just blank?
 Yeah, they're like I don't know and one of the things we've learned is you don't know what you need until you felt your feelings
 And so if we're practicing staying away from our feelings, we don't actually know what we need and as you were sharing
 I'm gonna you can't get comforted because the Holy Spirit wants to bring you comfort
 But if you're not prepared to feel your lonely or your sad or your anger
 Any of those feelings you've got no place for Holy Spirit
 Yeah, as I was saying I was saying on Monday like if God wasn't
 Okay with emotions first of all he wouldn't have given them to us
 And then if you think about like there's so much in scripture where people had big emotions including Jesus and it was fine
 And I just realized it's it's me that's uncomfortable with big emotion and not knowing what to do with it
 Isn't God yeah, and it's partly because we were trained out with them. Yes by parents who weren't comfortable with feelings
 Yes, and they were trained as much safer, isn't it? Well, I'm not sure if it is
 Well, I thought it was for a while before we can get into talking about feelings AJ already mentioned Sage Hill
 I want to give credit where credit is do everything we're gonna be talking about comes from a man named chip.d
 chip is a
 He's the founder of Sage Hill, which is an organization a social impact organization here in Nashville. I
 Encumbered them two and a half years ago a little longer. I started going to see a therapist at Sage Hill
 And that therapist suggested I do group therapy, which I've been doing for two years.
 And in doing group therapy, all we did was talk about feelings, which led me to a book called
 The Voice of the Heart, which I'm going to encourage you right now.
 If anything we say in the next eight, nine weeks, it piques your interest.
 Please go ahead and buy Voice of the Heart by Chip Dodd.
 We'll put a link in the show notes.
 We'll just do yourself a favor and go get it.
 Just go get it.
 And also subscribe to their Sage Hill podcast as well.
 And then you can listen to Chip himself teach this way better because he is the author
 of this. So, one of the credit where credit is due, yeah, did group therapy, read this
 book, then we went and did some training with Sage Hill and had our minds blown. And so,
 today we don't even want to get into feelings. Like, we're going to do a little high level
 overview of feelings. And then, like I said, the next eight, nine weeks, we're going to
 take an episode a week devoted to one of the feelings that we're going to talk about in
 a second.
 I think where I want to start with is our need to feel our feelings contrasted with
 our training to refuse to feel our feelings.
 Okay.
 So like you were talking about, uh, I didn't know I wasn't feeling my feelings
 till I, I heard this teaching.
 Yeah.
 I mean, I really thought I was, and I, I was feeling some and certainly I was much
 less shut down than I was, you know, 15 years ago or 20 years ago or something
 like that where I was just in survival mode.
 So I would say I felt a lot more,
 but I would still say I would sort of instantly
 categorize whether it was appropriate, you know,
 oh, I feel angry is angry appropriate.
 Probably not good for a pastor.
 Okay, toss anger, you know, like that.
 You know, but like in a split second, like,
 nope, I'm gonna just throw a scripture verse at that
 in my head internally and kind of dismiss myself from it.
 Yeah, or I feel sad.
 Oh, I'm about to be in danger of grumbling.
 And I don't want the earth to open up and swallow me.
 So I'm just going to concentrate on all the things I'm going to be grateful for.
 Right.
 And avoid ever feeling sad.
 Yes.
 But I didn't realize I was doing that.
 Like I wasn't sort of intentionally doing that.
 And for the most part, I would say I don't feel that set.
 You know what I mean?
 Like, but when I did feel it, I just didn't have a box and I wanted everything in a
 proper box.
 I remember the second week I went to see my therapist.
 I went because of grief.
 Both my parents had died and I was struggling with like feelings of, I didn't know there
 were feelings of grief.
 I put it as I was having feelings without my permission, like wherever in charge of our
 feelings.
 And so he said to me, you know, talk to me about the last time he felt a negative emotion.
 I was like, yeah, well, I don't really have any negative emotions because nothing really
 negative happens to me.
 And he's like, right, right.
 Except for the death of both your parents in two years.
 And I was like, you make a good point.
 Go on.
 Go on.
 Go on.
 We're very, very familiar with the verse John 10 10 Jesus saying the thief came still killing the straw
 I've come that you may have life and have it to the full and so the question we must ask ourselves is what do we mean by
 full living
 Right what's a that's a scary question probably would be defined differently by most people
 I grew up thinking that full life what Jesus talking about there was eternity
 Okay.
 Oh, yeah.
 Look, see, he came to give you life and everlasting life in heaven.
 Yeah.
 The trouble is that that puts all responsibility to live well way, way out there.
 And I think it involves heaven for sure, but also Jesus came to bring heaven to earth.
 And so I'm going to quote from Chipsburg.
 I'm going to quote liberally from Chipsburg.
 But Chips said this.
 He said, "Living fully means more than happiness, comfort, or thrills.
 You have the capacity to experience true joy, yet you're equally capable of grieving deeply
 while holding on to hope.
 Full life means you can expect great things in the midst of great loss.
 You can accomplish many good things while still needing to be forgiven for the harm
 that you have caused.
 So there's this, I know, take a moment to just let that sink in.
 There's this concept that we need to acquaint ourselves with, and that we want to be people
 who have a high bandwidth for feelings. We talked a little bit about this on Wednesday
 on the Instagram hang, but Chip defines this scale from like one grief all the way to 10
 celebration. Like that's the range of the human existence, the human experience. And I remember
 when we were on that weekend, they all challenged us like, think about your family upbringing.
 What was the range of emotions you were permitted to operate in? Or what were the range of emotions
 that were demonstrated to you. So my question to you is think about your family of origin,
 think about your household growing up in, how good was your family at celebration?
 How good was your family at loss? How good was your family at demonstrating anger in a responsible
 way? And part of the reason that we really get good at not wanting to feel our feelings is
 We were taught. We were taught. Yeah. You know, and it gets really, really scary. But part of the
 reason we want to get really good at feeling our feelings is it helps us connect to ourselves.
 It helps us connect to God, helps us connect to others. And so feelings work is super, super
 important. It helps us be our true self rather than the self we present for approval. Like you were
 saying, "Oh, I'm a pastor. I'm not like to be angry. Therefore, I will not feel
 anger." But then what you're doing is we have less of you because the full part
 of you is not present. Right. And I think I would also say anybody who's ever had to
 be a survivor at home, like, you know, as a child or whatever, if you grew up in an
 abusive home or anything like that, where you had to survive by shutting down and
 not feeling like, "I remember thinking I can't afford to feel I won't survive this."
 And so that became my default is, nope, I don't feel this.
 I don't, you know, whatever this is, I don't feel it.
 I'm gonna survive it.
 And that's a hard pattern to break out of.
  </li><li>The other thing we learned on the weekend is like,
 that's an extreme case, like living in a violent household
 growing up. - Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>But for all of us, like I did not grow up
 in a violent household at all.
 And yeah, I still learned to do the same things as you
 because we all do from a very early age,
 we learn to look at the faces of the most important people
 in our orbit and work out, are we pleasing them?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>What do I need to do to perform in order to feel safe,
 in order to feel like I belong?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And so we've from a very early age,
 learn how to present a false self rather than our true self.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So probably either a big version of us or learn to disappear.
  </li><li>What do you mean a big version of us?
  </li><li>Well, like perform, you know, perform and be the funny guy.
  </li><li>Be the super self.
  </li><li>Be the super self or disappear like safety is
 and disappearing.
  </li><li>Right, withdraw, be invisible, keep the peace.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's what I try to do, I try to disappear.
  </li><li>Yeah, listen to this verse, Proverbs 27, 19 says,
 "As water reflects a face, so a man's heart reflects the man."
 And basically what the author of Proverbs is saying there,
 what's in your heart will come out.
 So the fallacy is that we think
 that we don't feel our feelings.
 The fallacy is you're like,
 I shouldn't feel angry.
 Magically, I'm no longer angry.
  </li><li>It's gone.
  </li><li>And yet your kids, your spouse,
 the way around you are then forced to feel the feelings
 you're refusing to feel.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>We can all tell when mom is in a good mood
 or when dad is in a bad mood
 or when this person in the office is upset.
 Without them doing or saying anything,
 we can feel everybody's feelings.
  </li><li>For sure.
 And it's true, like if your heart feels rejected, you will be somebody who comes across with
 a rejection identity.
 If your heart is in pain and you always move to defense because you don't want to feel
 your other people will experience you as a super defensive person.
 Yeah.
 There's no getting away for that.
 For me, my heart was resolutely shut down.
 I didn't know my heart was shut down.
 And it was, to clarify, it was shut down to all the negative emotions.
 Right.
 To say negative ones.
 Yeah.
 Which was not fun for anybody to be around, but it's not practical to live in a world that's
 filled with brokenness and not be prepared to receive anything negative.
 Yes.
 And here's what's important to know is I strive to be authentic.
 Like my whole, one of my 45, my whole 43 years of existence where I've learned various
 skills to not feel my feelings, I was being as authentic as I knew how to be.
 Wasn't like I was hiding.
 I was hiding for myself and didn't know I was hiding for my own feelings.
 So what we're talking about in learning to feel is learning to let our hearts feel
 what they need to feel in order that we can be fully alive.
 And I think too, if you, I think for me, I realized I, because I was, you know, I
 talked about this a little bit at the Ammonate Teaching, but if if you're not willing to feel
 your feelings, then you actually don't have something to give to Jesus to be to be comforted
 or even work it through. Right. You know, so I, I would say, you know, most of the time in my
 journaling, I was trying to be honest, but I was trying to be honest only about the things that I
 thought were appropriate to be feeling at the time. And you didn't know you were doing that?
 No, I had no idea.
 I thought, well, you know, I'm just being a positive person.
 I am a glass half full person and I am a glass half full person.
 And I do look at the world, world positively, but I would say part of that.
 Or I don't know if if this anyway, I would say I do definitely shut down the negative things quickly.
 What's the problem?
 You're being distracted by the Niagara Falls that's above us.
 Yeah, I think.
 We're recording this in our basement and up in the kitchen, our dear friend Kate is making us dinner.
 And I'm so excited. I'm not going to lie. I'm like, let's get her done.
 But also, this is a non-insulated room so we can hear every footstep and every door and every drawer and every sink.
 So hoping you can't hear it in the microphones, but that's why we're getting a little disoriented.
 We're giggling a little bit. Sorry about that.
 So over the next nine episodes, we're going to teach you to do three main things.
 The first thing we're going to teach you to do is feel your feelings.
 Yeah, you're feeling super important.
 Then we're going to learn to tell the truth about our feelings.
 Yep, that's the hard part.
 And then we're going to live out with the freedom that comes from those first two steps,
 which is basically realizing we're going to give up control or we're going to attempt to give up control.
 We're going to move towards giving up control.
 Yes, which is going to be difficult because we've spent a life trying to control everything.
 Grasp onto control, which is a fallacy.
 Yeah, I'm sorry.
 Itchy knows.
 All right.
 Here's where things get interesting.
 I know I said we're not going to talk about feelings.
 I'm just going to give you an introduction.
 In his book, Chip declares very, very boldly
 that you and I only have eight core feelings.
 My objection to this book, by the way, first of all,
 this book, I hate this book.
 I was like, oh, so many eye rolls when I read this book.
 Now I love the book.
 I felt the same.
 Now I don't think I agree with that.
 So Chip defines eight core feelings.
 And Chip is very clear that there's eight core feelings,
 just like there's seven musical notes,
 just like there's three primary colors.
 But out of those three primary colors,
 you get a breadth of a spectrum of colors.
 And I was those seven notes.
 You get harmonies and cords and the same thing with the eight core feelings.
 You get all of our emotions, but at the root, there's these eight core feelings,
 which are hurt, lonely, sad, angry, fear, shame, guilt, and glad.
 But why is there only one happy one or a good one?
 The most common question when we talk about this, people are like,
 "Well, there's only one good one and seven bad ones."
 Here's the thing.
 You'll see as we work through all of these feelings that actually all of them are positive.
 All of them are gifts from God to connect ourselves, to connect to others, to connect to him.
 All of those eight feelings, even the seven bad ones, all have a gift in them.
 And even the one that everybody jumps to, gladness.
 Like, "Why can't we just be glad all the time?"
 You can only be glad if you're prepared to experience all seven other feelings if we're prepared to feel those feelings.
 So that's the number one question we get.
 Why is there only like one positive one?
 Another question that's commonly asked is like, why is love not on there?
 Well, the thing is love has got feelings in it, but love is more than just a feeling.
 Yeah.
 I'm one that's often spotted that's not on there.
 People are like, why is depressed not on there?
 Like, I absolutely feel depressed.
 Well, depression is a physiological state that's got feelings in it.
 And actually, as we'll look, depression comes from actually the depressing of feelings,
 like not being prepared to feel your feelings, especially anger.
 So we'll talk about that.
 The thing I want to drill into you just now is the paradox of living fully is that
 in order to feel our feelings, we've got to be willing to experience feelings that
 we spent most of our life trying to avoid.
 Right.
 Running from as fast as we could.
 But I promise you, like I've been doing this work for two and a bit years and it is absolutely changed my life.
 And when people say, well, changed it how they don't like the answer I give.
 And so one of the answers I gave, I talked about this on Wednesday, it's like, I'm sadder than I've ever been.
 I'm lonelier than I've ever been.
 I'm more fearful than I've ever been, but none of those things are bad.
 It just means I was all those things before.
 I was just not prepared to be with myself in those feelings.
 And what I found is that when I sit in my feelings,
 when I welcome them, when I recognize their gift from God,
 God meets me in them and brings a gift out with it.
 And if that doesn't sound exciting
 or worth feeling your feelings for, just you wait.
 Like the next eight weeks that we go through this,
 you're gonna be amazed at the fruit
 that God brings from them.
  </li><li>Yeah, I would probably say,
 I mean, I haven't done as much work as Alan has.
 He's been in a group, what, for two years and whatnot.
 I did group for a bid and did the training course and stuff.
 But even for myself with what I have been processing with a Lord about feelings and stuff, I've
 realized I feel more connected to all of my emotions than I ever have in my whole life.
 And because of that, I actually feel more connected to God because I know what I want
 to talk about now.
 I feel more connected with Alan.
 I feel more connected with my kids.
 I just feel like, yeah, I'm definitely feeling more.
 But that's actually not bad because God's with me
 right in the midst of it.
 I would say through the gift of feeling my feelings,
 I've got more of me, which means all my loved ones
 get more of me.
 Yeah.
 Oh, I would say we get way more of you.
 Yeah.
 And again, it's important to understand
 there was not a cognitive refusal for me to feel.
 Like it wasn't like I just read a white paper,
 I read this book and was like, oh, that's what it is.
 It was, I didn't know I was living the way I was living.
 And I think if you tried to-
  </li><li>Me neither.
  </li><li>Part of my argument with my therapist was,
 I was like, why didn't you tell me this before?
 He's like, would you have had a grid for it?
 Would you have understood it?
 I was like, no, no.
 Actually, you need to journey in your curiosity
 till you realize what's not been working.
 there might be another answer that you don't particularly like.
 And for me it was group therapy.
 I remember when he said, do you want to go group therapy?
 And I was like, no.
 I remember when you came home and said, we'll suggest a group therapy.
 And I just started gofying.
 And I was like, you've got to be kidding.
 And I'm like, you know, I was literally like, you could not pay me enough money to do that.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 And who knew it turned out to be like one of the greatest gifts God's ever given me.
 Yeah. Amazing. Yeah.
 All right. Well, let me let me end this bit on field.
 Let me read another bit from chips books. This again from voice of the heart chips is this
 Feelings are the voice of the heart and you will not have fullness until you're adept at hearing and
 Experiencing all of them when you're not aware of your feelings your life is lived
 Incompletely whenever you don't feel you're blocked from living life to the fullest wherever you lack awareness of your heart
 No room exists for God Wow
  </li><li>Do you lack, what did it say, review?
  </li><li>Wherever you lack awareness of your heart,
 no room exists for God.
 Back to what you preached on Monday night.
  </li><li>Wow, yeah, but what a way to say it.
  </li><li>Oh, he's a wordsmith.
  </li><li>Dude.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I'd really encourage you to get the book and read it.
 Or listen to the podcast.
 So I'll put a link, there's tons of episodes,
 but just look for the series that it did on Feelings.
 It's absolutely excellent.
 So we just wanna excite you.
 This is where we're gonna be going in the next couple of weeks.
 We're going to take a feeling a week.
 We're going to talk about them.
 We're going to talk about the gift in each feeling.
 We're going to talk about the impairment as in, what happens
 if you're not prepared to feel that feeling?
 What then?
 We're going to talk all about that.
 We'll tell stories from our life and working with that.
 But for now, you've got questions.
 If you've got comments, you've got feedback, send them to us.
 We're on social media.
 Links below.
 Or you can just email us.
 Or what else?
 Carrier pigeon.
 Carrier pigeon.
 That would be great.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 We do want to do an Instagram Live like we talked about before.
 We're going to do it at Wednesday, the 15th, that's this coming Wednesday.
 That doesn't help because I don't know when you're listening to this, but Wednesday, the
 15th of April, Wednesday, the 15th of April at 12 noon, central standard time.
 That gives a chance, like I said, for listeners in Europe to join us as well.
 Really sorry.
 It was such a late night for some of you last time.
 Adi Jones, anything you want to say as we end?
 I think too, I don't know if we're going to do this.
 We had talked about doing little updates on, you know, basically the last four months as
 well, mixed in with our, uh, you with the teaching on feelings and stuff, just to kind
 of bring you up to date on a bunch of things that have happened in the last couple months,
 just for fun.
 So we'll probably do that as well.
 And I'm, I'm excited.
 I think this teaching or understanding these eight emotions and how they work and kind
 of where we're being robbed from by ourselves, like I'm robbing me.
 Yeah.
 I think it's super helpful.
 I think also in this crazy time where I'm watching people work really, really hard.
 I can feel myself working really hard not to feel certain feelings.
 It's so, so important that we are kind to ourselves and kind to our loved ones.
 hope you're doing okay. We realize that there's a huge variation of what people are feeling.
 Some people are just glad to be at home. Some people have lost their jobs. Some people are
 terrified that this is the end of the world it isn't. But you know, wherever you are today,
 I want you to know that the God of all comfort would love to be with you. We're happy to
