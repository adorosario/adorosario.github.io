<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to episode 200 of keeping up with the jones is with this week we're talking about building a history with God baby just 200 we should do something special to celebrate we should.
 Oh wait we are but you have to stay to the end of the episode to find out what it is.
 We had quite the fun this week. Last week we were talking about how we celebrated Canada Day.
 And this week we got to celebrate Happy Birthday America Day, otherwise known as July 4th.
 I was like okay that's not what they call it.
 I'm still getting used to the 4th of July and I know I need to read up on it. Oh by the way we
 We have followed up from last week.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 It was the British who burned on the White House, not Canada.
 No.<br/>
 But we did it on behalf of Canada.<br/>
 Well...<br/>
 No, no, no, no.<br/>
 Will Law, who is an expert in all things, especially any English.
 So I know that he had a vested interest and finally answered to this.
 So he did some research and provided me with a Wikipedia link, which I can send you later.
 And you're right that vertical is commonly misused as a fear of heights.
 And that's not what it is.<br/>
 It is what you said in a year imbalance because you're doing this nausea.
 Good.<br/>
 I'm also right about the Canadians burning down the White House because it's the well,
 technically they were still British at the time.
 That is true.<br/>
 However, then those people actually, you know, became Canada and stayed and they launched
 it from New York, which is the original name for the city of Toronto.
 So they're Canadians in my mind because they stayed in Canada.
 They were the original Canadians right there.
 Okay, Canadian pride will not die.<br/>
 They will not.<br/>
 What do we do for Fourth of July?<br/>
 We are not America's hat people.<br/>
 We are not America's hat.<br/>
 What do we do for the Fourth of July?<br/>
 We went to our neighbor's house and we narrowly miss being set on fire.
 Oh my gosh, we did.<br/>
 So this is what happened.<br/>
 We were doing the fireworks, which I'm not sure we were supposed to be doing those in
 the city limits, but that's another story altogether.
 And one of the fireworks was one of these ones that sends off like 16 rockets high into
 the sky, you know, all different colors.
 And it sent off the first one and then it fell over.
 Because the slope of our street is insane.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And so toppled over.<br/>
 toppled over and was pointing into the crowd of mostly moms and children and started firing
 rockets at us.<br/>
 We all went running, screaming into the garage, literally freaking out because, of course,
 we're being hit by rockets.<br/>
 Then Nick, who was one of the dads, ran into the flames, as it were, ran towards the rocket
 and set it back upright.<br/>
 What made the whole situation worse was MJ was freaking out way before this.
 MJ was freaking out our five rope.<br/>
 His was sound, yeah.<br/>
 He was freaking out with sparklers and he wanted nothing to do with it.
 We had this problem last year.<br/>
 Oh dear.<br/>
 And I was hoping that, oh no, this year should be good.
 And so I was doing everything I could to coax them outside.
 So he was behind the windows in the dining room and I said, look, buddy, let's go out
 and sit on the patio.<br/>
 And so I was going to sit out on the front porch.
 And so I just, I said, I'm going to leave the front door open.
 He's going to go out onto the front porch.
 You can come and join me if you want.<br/>
 And he was basically staring right behind me,
 but with a pane of glass behind him.<br/>
 And then the fireworks toppled before him.
 (laughing)<br/>
 And we all started screaming and running for our lives.
</p><ul>
  <li>Don't forget to run in.
 And that was it.
 He was done.
 He's having nothing to tell him.
  </li><li>So yeah, he's already told me he doesn't want
 to do the fireworks part next year.
 He's like, I'll just go home and go to bed.
  </li><li>I don't know why.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I had an interesting week this week.
 I went to prison.
  </li><li>You did?
  </li><li>Yeah, for three days.
 I know, but I let you back out.
 So that was nice.
 There is an amazing ministry in Nashville called
 send musicians to prison, which if I was going to start a
 ministry, I'm sad that that name's already taken, but it's
 genius.
 And the idea is that they take Christian artists into maximum
 security prisons and minister the gospel, do you know, usually
 do a show and then do Q&amp;A and preach the gospel.
 And they've been extending their reach.
 And Joanna Lampa, who is one of the ministers with send
 musician, reached out to us and said, "Would you guys be interested in coming into the
 women's prison in Nashville on a couple of these days to teach on boundaries? Or could
 we do your father heart course, the Finding Father book?" And we were like, "Yes!" And
 so that's what happened this week. I went up for three days. One of the days we couldn't
 get in because of a variety of reasons, but the other two days I got to spend a morning
 with several of the inmates in this prison and got to teach them on boundaries, which
 I was wondering how boundaries was going to work, but as they said in their own testimony,
 so it was like, wish we knew this before, but it was such a joy. It was a new experience for me.
 I had not been in an American prison before, but it was a real privilege. And I love that all
 these ladies are doing, finding father in prison and the videos that we have prepared that,
 yes, we're getting ready to make available to everybody else, but the videos that we've prepared,
 they're going through that 12-week course with the videos and the books.
 I just think that's amazing and I love that. So thank you, Joanna, for taking me in.
 That was a real treat and a real eye opener for me this week.
 How did it compare to an Icelandic prison? Because you went there. Was it similar-ish?
 Question mark?
 Being in Iceland was different because I mean, I had its own hurdles in that I couldn't connect
 with any of the prisoners on my own. I mean, they all spoke English but I didn't know that.
 And it was a men's prison. And I wasn't sure what we'd been set up for. You know,
 we went in with Baldur who used to run that prison. And so we don't know.
 From the inside as an inmate.
 Yeah, we don't know what Baldur had told them or what they were expecting. So I was just going
 with the flow and we ended up doing physical healing. And that was an amazing time. With this one,
 they'd already been primed, you know, it was a course and, you know, so they understood.
 So it was, it was amazing. The kingdom of God,
 I was going to say works best among the poor in spirit. And I don't mean that,
 I don't mean to limit it, but in my experience, they know they're missing something.
 Well, yeah, you have no pun intended a captive audience. And I loved it. It was a real privilege
 to be there. So great. We spent a lot of our free time this week doing something that I'm glad we
 only tend to do every 10 years is we're looking for another car. Yeah, it's true. We are.
 So many needs to be something. Yeah, for sure. And I don't want to get all negative,
 but I'm excited that the end of the process we will find an additional car, which we desperately
 need. But it's brand tiring, isn't it? It is trying to hold in your head. Who's got what?
 and at what price and what options and yeah, it's like, you know what I don't mind. We have,
 it's like buying mattresses. Yeah, I wish there was some sort of system where everybody
 named their cars the same way, which to some extent, do you mean the trim level? Not the models,
 but the trim levels, you know, you know, to some extent there is like, you know,
 Honda and Kia are pretty similar.
 But then, you know, Volkswagen isn't.
 And then Ford seems to have like 18 different term levels.
 And it's just like, but why does it have to be so difficult?
 God bless our kids.
 They've been very faithful and traipsing around all these dealers.
 Four little sweet things.
 And the, yeah, they're just, I want to enjoy.
 And then of course we're showing up at all these dealerships with two car seats
 to make sure that two car seats can fit in the back of whatever little four by four.
 We're drying out.
 which they don't.
 Some of them just don't and then we thought of it.
  </li><li>The kids get in and go, "We don't fit."
 We're like, "All right, we don't need to test drive this one."
 But anyway, so I think we've potentially frustrated
 a few dealers, but--
  </li><li>And we've narrowed it down to a very short list.
  </li><li>Yes, we have.
  </li><li>Then you spoke this morning on the goodness of God,
 how'd that go?
  </li><li>I think it went well.
 I still have that thing where I'm not sure.
 I think it went well.
 I mean, it felt good.
 I felt like people were connecting.
 So yeah.
  </li><li>I thought you looked really cute.
 Thanks.
 Yeah, you kept my attention.
 Oh, well.
 But what were you thinking?
 Were you thinking about the goodness of God or other things?
 Our main topic for this week is all about building a history with God.
 I think about this whole, this, I don't know if it's just because I've had a
 birthday or because a lot of what we teach is based on our lives.
 But I was thinking about the importance of having a history with God and, and now
 that I'm in my mid 40s and realizing I have a, you know, at least a meaningful 25 year
 relationship with God. And I love it. I wouldn't trade any of it. There's bits I wish I could
 fast forward through. But I love having built this, this history with God. I want to kind
 of set a context before we talk about why history with God is important. It is absolutely
 vital that our relationship with Christ must be current.
 Yes.
 It's not, it's not enough to bask on what you were.
 I noticed that most people's testament.
 No, I don't want to say most people.
 I have noticed that there's a danger that we confuse our testimony with our history.
 Our testimony is what God is doing now.
 Our history is what God has done.
 Both are vital, but you can't live out of years old experiences with God.
 That's not what we were designed to do.
 You're just sure.
 overlap. Yeah, I was thinking about manna, literally the bread of heaven, bread from heaven that came and how they weren't allowed
 to collect. They weren't allowed to store anything that they could use later, right, except on the Sabbath. It was made fresh daily. It was made fresh daily. And I think that's exactly what our relationship with the Lord is supposed to be like, I get crusty.
 When I let days go by that I haven't connected with the Lord in more than a passing prayer.
 Like it's, it's, I just don't like myself.
 I don't like my outlook.
 I don't like my attitude when that happens.
 The first point I want to make is we want to have a current relationship that is
 strengthened by the daily voice of God.
 But at the same time we're building and we can draw upon this rich history with God.
 I think too, when you're in current circumstances that you've been in similar ones before, you
 know, in your history and you saw God break through, that's where the two of them really
 work well together.
 You know, when you're in the midst of forming a new testimony, but you're actually looking
 back and going, okay, okay, I've navigated something that felt a lot like this before.
 And God got me through this or God did this or God broke through in this way.
 And so I can hang on to His faithfulness more easily because I have a history of breakthrough.
 But it's important that we keep our history refreshed.
 Yes.
 Otherwise.
 If everything is from five or 10 years ago, it's...
 I bet even if it is, you even got that amazing miracle 10 years ago, but you forget about
 it and you're not in the habit of calling it to mind or practicing thankfulness.
 I mean, that's what the Old Testament is about,
 who is watching Israel.
 Forget.
 Just repeatedly forget.
 And that's why we have all these encouragement.
 I was thinking, just as I was pondering
 what we're going to be sharing tonight about how important
 geography is to our history with God.
 I could literally drive you to Toronto.
 Well, that would take forever.
 But we could literally go to Toronto tonight.
 And I could show you the carpet where I had an encounter
 with a father.
 I could drive up to Marmock Drive and show you the exact spot on the floor where I had
 this revelation with God out at the Book of Exodus.
 I could take you in a room and show you journals that are 20 years old that are handwritten
 that in there are promises and prophecies about what our life looks like today.
 I love that we have that.
 I just think that's amazing.
 I love that on my phone I've got prophecies from David Campbell and from David Wagner
 from earlier this year or from Jamie Galloway from a couple of years ago, I could bring you
 to our house that was prophesied into existence. I love the...
 Yeah, it's amazing.
 It's not just esoteric thoughts, they're tangible, practical parts of our history with God.
 Yeah, it's amazing. I think too, what's also kind of fun about actually keeping track of and
 and recognizing your history with the Lord is that you end up with opportunities also
 to encourage other people with what God has done for you.
 And it's not theoretical.
 Right.
 It's like actually I totally get it.
 I've been there.
 Let me tell you what God does.
 I get real nervous when I listen to people who are speaking the truth, but it's theoretical
 in their own lives.
 Right.
 They haven't actually walked through that or whatever.
 different in the substance that people bring when they're actually talking about their own
 journey with a lot. Tia is in the stage where she always wants to hear our story of how we met.
 I was telling her the other day. Oh, she asked for it again today. She's a hard mom's perspective
 and she told me details that you forgot. I was like, no doubt she did. I tried to explain to her
 because she was like, "Daddy's never told me that part in this part." And when I was like,
 "Oh, well, honey, most girls, we fill in all the gray areas too and all the little details
 And she's like, oh, I liked the details, you know, so I was like, great.
 I was with her tonight.
 She just, you know, came into my room.
 I was lying down and she said, Daddy could have a cuddle.
 And I was like, of course, can so she climbs on at the bed with me.
 She's, I just love cuddles.
 And we just sat and talked about her future.
 She just, you know, I was just talking to her about how the most important
 thing is to keep her love for Jesus real and, and, you know, she was asking
 to, I think, is she'd be a good mom.
 And I was like, yeah.
 I'm just kind of talking to her, but helping her build her future, I guess, or just to
 have some godly expectations for what life is like.
 And I realized that actually all of what God does in our life is for the future.
 Yeah.
 Like he constantly equips us with what we need either through prophecy or encouragement
 or teaching.
 We think it's for today, but it's actually for the future.
 And like we were talking about earlier, all through the Old Testament, there's all these reminders to not forget.
 And it's not that God wants us to live in the past, but we use the past to fuel us forward.
 We're told to remember what God has done, we're told to remember who we are, and we're actually told to use the people of Israel as an example to not be like them in the way that they forgot.
 Yeah. When you look back on your life and you think about the richest parts of your history
 or the densest parts of your history, would you say that they occurred more in what we might
 classify as the difficult seasons of life or the easy seasons of life? Not easy, but the
 fruitful seasons of life. I think probably the more difficult seasons. I think because you're
 needing to be face to face with God to make it through.
 And so I think when I look back at some of the really, really hard things
 and just the way that the Lord, you know, I don't want to do the cheesy
 footprints in the sand thing, but the way, you know, God carried me
 and how close that felt and how secure that felt.
 And really, I didn't have the strength to go through it on my own.
 So it was like, carry me or leave me here, you know, kind of thing.
 But yeah, I think so much of the richness or the strength of the relationship that I have
 with the Lord now is because of hanging on to Him during those seasons and just deciding
 like, "Hey, there's so much I don't understand about what I'm currently going through, but
 I will not let go of God.
 I won't..."
 You know, I was talking about it this morning, "I won't let go of believing He's good.
 I won't let go of believing He's faithful."
 even if all my circumstances seem to be screaming something different, I won't let go.
 But that's because you've...
 That's exactly because you can look back on times where God did come through for you.
 Of course we've got the Bible, and of course we use the Bible, and of course that's vital.
 But there's something about having our own experience of who God is for us to pull forward.
 I've seen tonight about David's confidence in beating Goliath,
 And we know he says to King Saul when King Saul's like, I don't think this is the best
 Strategy and he's like actually no the same God that rescued me from the Paul the lion and the Paul of the bear
 Is the same God is gonna rescue me from this Philistine giant?
 He used his his previous history with God to write a new one with God and I
 I think it's Chris Valtin that says, you know, everybody wants to test him and he bit nobody wants to test
 Right.
 And the richness that we're looking for actually comes through walking with God in places we
 might never choose to go.
 And I think the trick is to not lose sight of that when inevitably we get into good times
 and human nature is that we forget God.
 And that's why I'm determined to not build our relationship with the Lord on need, but
 build our relationship with the Lord on life.
 Yeah, because once need goes away, which it will, because this is who years, because he loves to satisfy us.
 When that need vanishes, when that crisis fades away, when difficult times turn to good,
 are we going to be people who still remember God and still choose to be with him as much as we would in times of crisis?
 Yeah.
 I was also thinking, though, when you're talking about David and Saul and all of that, like, you know,
 when I was saying about how the Lord carried me and I knew we'd make it through and you're saying,
 yeah, that's because you had a history. But like the first time that I went through something hugely
 difficult, I would say very, very young in relationship with the Lord. And Dad had died and my whole
 world exploded. And I would say more than anything else, I borrowed on other people's history of the
 the Lord and that, you know, they had navigated storms with the Lord and they were still standing
 and not only that, they were thriving. I mean, to begin with, I really borrowed off of, okay,
 so I'm hearing you say I'm going to make it. I'm hearing you say he'll be faithful to
 me. I'm borrowing your history until I have a history of my own. And so I think there's
 some of both like if you're listening today and you're thinking, well, gosh, I don't really
 have this huge history with the Lord in terms of navigating tough spots and that kind of stuff.
 I think you can borrow off of the history of others and let that sort of bolster your faith
 that God is who he says he is as you write history together.
 That's beautiful. I think that's the purpose of testimony is to help other people write their
 history. Yeah. And that's what today's about today is tomorrow's history. So if you don't
 have, if you're thinking, I don't have great history, then guess what? You get to practice
 that every morning. It's amazing. Yeah. So yeah, those are thoughts on building history
 with God. We encourage you to do it. It's amazing. And the beautiful thing is the more
 you walk with God, the more history you have. Yeah, for sure. Would you like an interesting
 question? I would. Josh wrote in and he said, my wife and I are listening to back episodes
 and had a question. How different would your podcasts have been if you'd been doing them
 when your first child was four? As a bit of context, we have a four-year-old and a two-year-old
 now and find out a challenge to do anything else except keep up with them during the season.
 Yeah, I don't think we would have tried to start a podcast when they were four and two.
 I mean, it's not only that you're dropping to the couch at seven o'clock as soon as they're in bed,
 But it's all day long supervision when they're that age.
 And it's after they're four and heading into being five,
 they sort of skyrocket in their ability
 to follow instructions and play on their own
 and not touch things they're not supposed to be touching
 and all that kind of stuff.
 Where under four, it's kind of all hands on deck
 and you're getting them dressed as like trying to put
 an octopus and a mesh bag.
 I mean, everything is just more difficult.
 So, you know, I think if you tried to sell me on the idea of doing a podcast, then I would
 have been like, have fun.
 Hey, that got great idea.
 Because I ain't doing it.
 Yeah, like you forget like now all of our children, you're just like, hey, go get dressed.
 Hey, go have a bath.
 Hey, go have a shower.
 Yes, you can have a snack.
 Hey, tidy up after yourself.
 They can do all that to varying degrees.
 They don't need to need some help.
 Although he got dressed today on his own and puts his own shoes on.
 That sounds ridiculous, but if you've been doing that, I was watching our friend Sarah
 this morning, Sarah and Josh have just got this beautiful baby and she's on the front
 row by the flight.
 That's stunning.
 At that stage, you have, I've forgotten how much your attention has to be on a baby all
 of the time.
 You do everything.
 Like, I was just even thinking about today, you come downstairs and you cook dinner and
 you don't need to be thinking about where the kids are.
 Whereas at four and two, you need the kids in your eyesight while you're cooking dinner.
 Yeah, I don't think we would have done a podcast then, but that would that sounds mental. Yeah. I
 Was thinking when we started it they were what seven five and one
 But we had two above five. Yeah, we'd had practice as well and again the little one well all of them were always in bed
 Before we tried to do anything
 By the time you get to your third you kind of care less, you know and she's eating dog vid is mad
 What it's not gonna kill him?
 Do you know you're you're you're less I don't feel like I care less
 Totally do really yeah, okay, but by time
 Abby was fine. Well you didn't write and speak French and Italian
 MJ we don't worry that he hasn't learned his alphabet
 What I mean get there yeah, we tell you fine. He's so good as elder and that's all that man
 That's all that he's gonna need in kindergarten
 We mentioned last week that we are taking a break for the summer so this is going to be our last episode for a few months.
 While we take a much needed break and enjoy our late evening hangs with our kids by the way i'm loving summer so far it's a loving it and we're going vacation soon don't worry however we're looking forward to returning the fall.
 And we'd love to hear from you about how we can make the podcast better for the fourth year running babe we have our annual listeners survey.
 It's one of our favorite things to do.
 We love reading our listeners' feedback.
 We'd love to hear from you.
 We build the podcast for you.
 We don't do it for our entertainment, and we really want to know how we could serve you
 better.
 And so, while we're taking a break, we'd love it if you would fill in the survey.
 It's going to be available for the next couple of weeks.
 If you go to <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/survey, it won't take long.
 Do it today.
 You have a chance to win $100 worth of Amazon or iTunes gift vouchers.
