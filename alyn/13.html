<p> Hey, Jones here we are for another episode of keeping up with the Joneses. We are in fact here. I want to keep up with you
 Tell me how your week was best of luck
 My week was uh good<br/>
 It was a busy week, but there's not much fun stuff to report like
 You know kids starting school and doctor's appointments and kindergarten screenings and that kind of stuff
 And lots of little kid birthday parties with lots of screaming and running around
 Right busy week, but not the type of stuff that makes a podcast interesting
 No.<br/>
 Next.<br/>
 Tell me some funny stories.<br/>
 Tia, our five-year-old,<br/>
 had us in stitches today.<br/>
 There's a phrase that my mother used to say when we were kids that
 shoots, I love you so much I could eat you up, which if you think,
 taking literally is an absolutely horrible phrase to say to a child.
 But we say to our kids all the time, "Oh, you're so cute.
 I could eat you."<br/>
 So today, Tia made a startling case for why she should not be eating.
 She started with "But I have boogers in my nose."
 And we're like, what's your point darling?
 Well, if you ate me, you would eat my boogers and that's gross.
 And so I was like, of course, well, I love boogers.
 They're the best.<br/>
 She's like, but then I have blood.<br/>
 They have bone.<br/>
 And there's stuff in my ears, she said.
 And if you were to chew on my teeth, it would hurt your teeth.
 But the, the, and I rest my case.<br/>
 My lord was when she said, you can't eat me because I have a heart and Jesus lives in it.
 And so you'd have to eat Jesus too.<br/>
 And you don't want to eat Jesus.<br/>
 So clearly she's going to be a lawyer or something.
 More something for sure.<br/>
 It's quite funny.<br/>
 And my other favorite thing I tweeted this, we were, we haven't watched up
 in a while, certainly Michael John has never seen that up.
 So I was introduced to my kids as all good father should do to the Pixar
 movies and so we're watching up, but you know that beautiful scene, babe, where you know,
 there's no dialogue. It's the beautiful music. And it just basically tells the story of how they
 meet and they get married and they fall in love and they buy a house. Yeah, I really don't like it.
 I try to have kids and you know, go through through through through through. I'm watching this and
 I happen to say it low to nobody in particular. This is probably the most moving seven minutes in
 movie history. Tia, without skipping a beat, she goes, yeah, too bad she dies at the end.
 So I'm not a responder than Tia. So that was probably the highlight of my week, just
 assumed to my five year old be brilliant. We have a couple of readers questions that we didn't get to
 last week. I've got an anonymous question. I'm not sure how I feel about anonymous questions,
 But this question says, in a marriage, how do you manage your best friend and be married?
 What do you do if your spouse doesn't seem to understand?
 So I'm not quite sure I understand.<br/>
 But the question is.<br/>
 Right, I'm not quite sure I understand the question.
 So whoever's in the end, if you didn't think about a better way of writing that, sorry,
 that sounds terrible.<br/>
 If you can think, I'm owning that I don't understand the question rather than that you
 are a terrible question, right?<br/>
 That's not what I'm saying.<br/>
 But if you think of a way of helping me understand that a little bit better, we'll have a stab at answering that next week.
 Another question this time, not anonymous came from Amanda, and she said, "Hey, Ellen, and AJ. Hey, Amanda.
 I loved hearing your road to Nashville story, but I've always wondered what the transition was like when you arrived.
 Did Grayson already have a young adults ministry, or did you have to form one? And what was that process and time like, what did you all learn?"
 Well, we learned a ton to start with.<br/>
 Did it already have an young adults ministry sort of, but it hadn't really been operating
 for a while.<br/>
 So we formed one and we knew we were coming here to do three things.
 And one of them was to form a adult ministry.
 And I had been part of one in Toronto that was fairly successful.
 And we liked some of the stuff from that.
 We just started envisioning really what we wanted to happen.
 And so we formed one.<br/>
 Yeah, we had our first meeting, I think like January 19th or something like that, and sort
 of a preliminary, "Hey, we're going to do this if you want to join a school."
 Right, and that was just saying.<br/>
 We were just saying that the very first meeting, "Hey, this is who we are, and this is what
 we like."<br/>
 And we don't really know what we're doing, but we know that we love the presence of God
 more than anything else.<br/>
 And we're just going to follow the Holy Spirit.
 So if you want to come along, come along kind of thing.
 And people seem to.<br/>
 We're now fifth year, four years, fifth year.
 Well, we're past five now, aren't we?<br/>
 I don't know.<br/>
 I've asked.<br/>
 But we still do the same thing.<br/>
 We just, you know, want to spend a long time in the presence of God.
 And then we love practical teaching and impartation.
 But I think the most powerful thing is our ministry time at the end,
 where people can come in and experience and encounter God.
 in the prophetic ministry beforehand. I just love that there's no master plan because that way
 God gets to move probably more freely than if we had a master plan.
 Right. Now, there's an odd for us as people who love plans to not have a master plan.
 But yeah, I don't know if that helps answer your question, but the transition was very easy
 when we arrived. We loved it. We just kind of hit the road flying and I've never lived back.
 we really loved it. Awesome. Well, this week, AJ, we were talking about what we want to talk about.
 And there's a bunch of topics we could have talked about, but I want to talk about two
 my favorite people in the whole wide world. Yes, let's. And the reason for this is a number of
 reasons. We were talking last week about revival, and you were talking about your journey into
 revival in Toronto. And so the two people we want to talk about this week is John and Carol
 on it. I don't think there's any, I purply when I make this next statement that there's
 an awful lot in my life that I would not have if it was not for them. Yes. I would not have
 a revelation of the Holy Spirit and the Father and Jesus like I do now if it wasn't for John
 and Carol. Yes. And I wouldn't have you as my wife. No, most likely not. And as a result,
 I wouldn't have the children I have or the nice way I have.
 Sure.<br/>
 We wouldn't be here.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 So we owe them a huge debt.<br/>
 They've just been.<br/>
 Significant.<br/>
 Isn't that big enough word?<br/>
 Absolutely significant.<br/>
 I thank the Lord.<br/>
 I thank the Lord.<br/>
 That's right.<br/>
 I thank the Lord for them all the time for what they've done for us and what they've done for countless
 thousands of people all over the world.
 Yeah.<br/>
 They're.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Wonderful.<br/>
 Tell us how you first met them.<br/>
 Well, I first met them at the church.<br/>
 I think I can't remember if I've told that story.
 We've told the story many times.<br/>
 You mean on the podcast?<br/>
 Yeah, on the podcast.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 Well, even if you have, some people might not have heard it.
 So tell again, because it's so awesome.
 Give us the nutshell.<br/>
 The nutshell version is I got hijacked by a friend and brought to their church.
 And I didn't want to go and I was mad and I was staying in the back end protest and
 the worship started and<br/>
 At this particular time in my life my father had killed himself a few months before and I was an
 Absolute mess completely obsessed with killing myself
 and they started singing this song called father I want you to hold me and
 I remember hearing a horrific noise and it probably took me about 30 seconds
 which sounds really bizarre to figure out I was making it, but I howled.
 I mean, just how old is.<br/>
 I was sort of getting in touch with core pain.
 And which is unusual because at that point you were ridiculously shut down.
 Really shut down.<br/>
 I didn't, yeah, I didn't talk really.<br/>
 I never let anybody see me cry and I could not get it together.
 So here you are in a new church wailing on control.
 Wailing with one of the most shy people you've ever met in your life.
 sitting beside me poor Sandy should probably buy her something.
 But how many people are in the church?
 Oh, maybe 60 wasn't very many.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 So it's not like you could have got lost.
 You were.<br/>
 No, everybody looked at me at some point during the worship set.
 Cause I mean, I could be heard over top of any volume of worship.
 Um, and, uh, anyway, at the end of worship, I sat down only because
 Sandy pulled me down into my chair probably because she was dying a thousand deaths.
 And I don't think Sandy realized just how much was stored up within me.
 And at the end of the service, you know, John had spoken at the end of the service.
 He said, "There's somebody here that needs to know that Daddy loves them."
 And good guess, John.<br/>
 Good guess, John.<br/>
 Could it be the check losing it at the back?
 um, keen sense of the obvious.<br/>
 Uh, anyway, I remember thinking to myself, I'm not going up there.
 There's 60 people in this room watching me, but I seriously wonder if angels were pushing me.
 I remember my body getting up and walking up there and me thinking,
 what are we doing?<br/>
 Why are we going up there?<br/>
 You know, but anyway, walked up and John opened up his arms and I walked into his arms and I cried all over that man for about 40 minutes.
 It's not tears.<br/>
 The whole scenario.<br/>
 And they pretty much have had me since then,
 whether they wanted me or not.
</p><ul>
  <li>But you just, you sobbed and snarled all over that shirt.
 You never saw that shirt again.
  </li><li>No, and still to this day when we asked John
 about the shirt, he just smiles.
 He never says anything.
 So for a while there, we were buying him a new shirt
 every Christmas before we just to make sure that we...
  </li><li>Hey John, we owe you a shirt.
  </li><li>Hey John, since you're not gonna tell us,
 we're just gonna buy you another shirt.
  </li><li>So you met them as we discovered last week,
 way before revival ever hit.
 couple years before.
  </li><li>And then they just parented you back to life really.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, to begin with, it was just, you know,
 Sunday mornings, it was, you know, it was mostly John
 and John would see me and just love me or pray for me
 or give me a hug or, you know, stuff like that.
 And then a little later on, when I was doing things like
 hitting other youth leaders at church, Carol would call me
 aside and have little discussions about not punching
 people at church and, you know, hand--
 So old tassel.
 Handy tips like that.
 You know, so, yeah, and then, you know, when the renewal started, we basically all lived
 at the church.
 I mean, you just, you went every night.
 You didn't even have to talk to your friends about where you're going to be because you
 all knew you were coming back tomorrow night.
 See what God was going to do.
 I, um, I find it funny that, you know, before I'd ever met them, I'd read all this stuff
 on the internet about them.
 And you know, you can Google a whole lot of nonsense about them.
 And now knowing them for 10 plus years and having lived with them for four of those years
 and having been by their side traveling the world with them for over a year, it's so
 funny that people can come to the conclusions that they have about them.
 Because truth be told, they're, I don't know how to describe them.
 They're two of the most Jesus loving people I know.
 I mean, their love for Jesus is incredible and tangible.
 We're going to be.
 And they actually, the two of them, they have a lot in common with the Holy Spirit, you
 know, in their personalities.
 They're, they're ridiculously fun to be around.
 They're constantly emanating joy.
 Wouldn't you say?
 They're constantly pointing towards Jesus.
 They are.
 They're constantly pointing towards Jesus.
 That's a very good point.
 And they're very humble.
 they're, yeah, they're just incredibly joyful people to be around.
 I love them.
 They both have eyes of love.
 They're childlike.
 Oh, so childlike.
 Yeah, they really enjoy when God does something, even if it's new.
 And even if they don't know what he's doing, they're, they don't panic.
 They just sort of go, okay, God, they're constantly asking him questions and, you
 know,
 I wonder if I have a somewhat unique
 perspective on some facets of their life, you know, having traveled with them and been
 so close to them in the midst of ministry. I would be always be amazed at the consistency
 of the Holy Spirit honoring them. And what I mean by that is we'd go to so many different
 churches and different cultures and different countries. And the same thing would always
 happen you'd walk in and the atmosphere was pretty. It was either vibrant with excitement
 about God was going to do on the other end of the spectrum really stayed in full of
 unbelief. But the same thing always happened, the Holy Spirit would show up and just,
 just absolutely turn the place upside down so gloriously.
 And I think part of that was their utter confidence, yes, that the Holy Spirit was going to show up,
 but also utter dependence on the Holy Spirit. Knowing full well, Lord, if you don't show up,
 then it's just another meeting. And, you know, I remember being in Oxford University in the
 the theology department. So much in the Holy Spirit, just fall on these students and on
 these professors and just have an incredible time and then, you know, go to Japan and see
 the same thing, you know, people all over the floor. But both John and Carol, you know,
 I'd be beside them and I'd hear them praying just these wonderful, beautiful tender prayers
 of submission and honor to the Lord. And it's no wonder he'd...
 But not not wordy, just simple.
 Yeah.
 Wasn't bull.
 Tell me some funny stories about John and Carol.
 Um, well, when we live with them, we used to have quite a bit of fun.
 Carol and I used to have fun hiding chocolate from you and John.
 How well did that work?
 It worked very well.
 You know, we had a stash.
 Are you on drugs?
 Dude, we had a stash that was.
 Dude, dude, we had a stash that you were able to find.
 And we had the stash that we were actually hiding that you guys didn't find.
 So I always found chocolate was in about 15 seconds of being in a kitchen.
 That was the ones you're allowed to find.
 I think you're making it.
 Okay.
 I just asked for funny stories, not antagonistic stories.
 Oh, well, we always knew we could get Carol to come down for a visit by
 cooking popcorn and opening the door between our apartment and their house above us.
 and she would somehow come up.
 She'd come down like a make up some excuse
 why she'd come down.
  </li><li>As Kryptonite is the Superman,
 so popcorn is the carol.
  </li><li>That's true, that's true.
 I remember John is really funny.
 He's quite, well, he appears to be very random,
 but he's got a great track record
 in the midst of that randomness.
  </li><li>Let's clarify, he's absolutely random.
 There's no appearing.
 He is one of the most random people ever, but he bats about eight or nine out of 10 for the Holy Spirit on that randomness.
 Yeah.
 So I remember this one time I had been in the midst of studying God's generals and had become fascinated with Amy Semple McPherson and was reading all this stuff on her and talking to the Lord about her and stuff like that.
 And while I was right in the midst of, you know, all this study of her, I see John in
 the cafeteria church and he's, you know, just putting his dry away and I'm putting my dry
 away.
 And he says, "A.J., you think about Amy Semple McPherson then?"
 I was like, "Oh, John, you know, I'm studying her.
 Oh, so you know who she is.
 Yeah.
 Well, I just think you're so like her or something."
 And then he just like walked away.
 And for me, I mean, for him, it was just some random conversation.
 But for me, it was like this huge confirmation of like, okay, God, you're talking to me through
 this person and encouraging me.
 Um, and this was before I'd gone into ministry and anything like that.
 It was just a fascination with the woman of God.
 Yeah.
 I would, I would wonder how many decisions John has made and the ministry that John
 leads has made based on John's randomness that is actually the Holy Spirit.
 I remember once being at conference in Jack Frost was speaking and there are probably
 a thousand people at the conference and I'm on one side of the church hall just trying
 to get something done.
 Actually, I'm running an errand and I see John, John catches my eye, he's on the front
 row and he beckons me to come over and so it's kind of inconvenient because it means
 after walk in front of the whole auditorium.
 You know right in front of all TV cameras on to the front row where John is and so I you know try and be subtle as I can
 I sit next to John and John's like
 Alan
 you see that young man over there and
 I look to my right and you know while everybody else is seated on the other side of the auditor and there's this young
 Man standing at my said aha John says over and say hello to him
 I'm like oh
 Okay, so I get up and proceed to walk to the complete other side of the auditorium where I meet this young man
 I just introduced myself to him say hi. He's like hi. I'm Alan. He's like hi. My name is whatever his name is
 And I'm like are you new here? And he's like yeah, I was like are you in China conference? He's like yeah
 I was like are you understanding what he's saying? He's like not really so I just had this conversation with him in a couple of minutes later
 I
 You know lead them to the Lord and so we shake hands. It's really nice to meet you
 Make sure you get somebody to pray for you before you leave and I go by and sit next to John
 And John's like how did it go? I was like well, I let him to the Lord and got him saved and John's like very good
 But you know, it's just a classic
 John move
 But you'd see him do that at all stages, you know all stages of ministry making decisions that was just astonishing to me
 Including hiring people, the signing where to go.
 It's, try out record was amazing.
 Should I tell the story of me dating you?
 Yes.
 So when I started, I went to the school, I did five months of school.
 And then there's a whole story of how I ended up interning with John and Carol.
 But it's my first week interning with John and Carol.
 I haven't met them because they're somewhere on the road.
 And I fall in love with AJ.
 And I would like to date her, but I want to do it really honorably.
 I want to speak to John and ask his permission.
 And I want to speak to another man called Fred Wright and ask his permission.
 And Fred happens both John and Fred would travel internationally all the time.
 So I met Fred first and introduced myself to him and said, Hey, you know, I'm really
 interested in dating your spiritual daughter, AJ Jones.
 And so he grilled me for about four or five minutes in his office.
 I swear profusely.
 I quoted lots of scripture.
 So he knew I knew the Bible and then he gave him permission.
 He was like, "Well Alan, I think that would be good."
 That's my forever impersonation.
 But because John was away, I didn't get to speak to John.
 So we went out for lunch or we went on a date and I knew I was going to be seeing John the
 next couple of days.
 So my whole plan was to just say, "John, Carol, you don't know me, but I know that
 you love AJ.
 I know she's really important to you and I'm an honorable man.
 I'd really like to pursue her.
 Can I have your permission?"
 But you know, John the Trichster already knew all of this because our friend Stuart had
 given John a heads up that I liked you.
 Yeah.
 Well, I was in the car.
 Thanks, Stuart.
 Thanks, Stuart, for that.
 So when I am in Virginia Beach and meet John and Kyle for the first time, I'm already
 nervous.
 I'm already playing on my head what to say to them.
 And I'm, you know, John just turns the tables on me when I pick him up to the airport.
 I'm like, "Hello, John.
 Hello, Carol.
 It's great to see you.
 I'm Alan."
 And, you know, let me drive you to the airport.
 I brought in the first thing John says is,
 what have you done to R.A.J.?
 (laughs)
 So I was wanted to speak to you first
 and you know, and so I'm panicking.
 And he's like, "Well, why don't we speak
 "at the end of the conference?"
 And I'm doing the math going 'cause that's like five days
 away, you're gonna make me swear for five days.
 And of course he's gonna make me swear for five days.
 (laughs)
 Conference finishes and it's like midnight 1 a.m.
 And John's like, "Why don't we have breakfast tomorrow?"
 And you can talk to Carol and I about, you know,
 AJ and your interest in her.
 So I'm like, okay, I got a better 1 a.m.
 I'm up at like 6 a.m.
 I'm having a shower, I'm cleaning my teeth,
 having another shower, I'm going to do the game.
 I'm memorizing scripture,
 I am, you know, making sure that I, you know,
 can answer all those questions.
 And so I go to their room and they said,
 you know, come at eight o'clock,
 I go to the room at eight and knock on the door,
 there's no answer.
 I'm like, maybe they're downstairs.
 Like, what do I do?
 Do I knock again?
 I'd be terrified if I woke them up.
 So yeah, I wait anxiously, I knock on the door again.
 And after a couple of knocks on the door,
 Carol answers the door, you know,
 in her house called Yawn and like,
 "Yeah, oh, come on, come on in.
 "Oh, I didn't realize you were here.
 "Oh gosh, well, let's get John out of bed."
 And I'm thinking, "Oh God, this is horrible.
 "This is like the worst time ever."
 But there's Cheerios, but come on in!
 Lord of room service, we'll have breakfast together.
 So there I am,
 sitting in John and Carol's hotel room,
 and they're in their pajamas in their house coat.
 And as normal as can be, and I'm freaking out,
 'cause they're my two heroes,
 and I'm trying to create good impression on them.
 And so I just start speed talking.
 And what I haven't learned yet is John
 has a pretty short attention span.
 So you've got about less than a minute
 to convey your idea to John,
 He's working out.
 You might get a whole two minutes sometimes.
 Never.
 I would take China for Jesus.
 He's planning global outreaches and revival.
 Clearly, John has begun into two now as I start my 45-minute prepared speech.
 But Carol, she's a high responder.
 She's making eye contact with me.
 She thinks I'm just so endearing and sweet and earnest.
 She's being a real mama and she's nodding.
 Of course, she thinks it's lovely that I love you so much.
 And so I finished be talking for 45 minutes and as I finish I said, so you know, what
 do you think?
 Do I have permission to pursue aging?
 John pushes back from the table, he gets up and he walks off.
 Well, he had also been taking pictures of you the whole time.
 Yeah, he had snapping pictures of you in love with a flash, which is very helpful.
 But anyway, he pushes his chair back, walks off to the other side of the room and with
 his back turned to me out of these immortal words.
 well it's all very interesting.
 But you know,
 aj could probably do a lot better for herself.
 But she's pushing 30 she can't afford to be picky so
 sure go ahead. Now I don't know John at all so I'm like
 is he joking is he serious I think he's serious so I'm like okay sir and Carol
 scaldson she chides him from the other side of the room
 Sean and John says, oh, I'm just teasing the poor boy.
 I think it's awesome.
 And that was my introduction to John's
 peculiar sense of humor, is I?
  </li><li>And then he suggested we should get married
 in three months time.
  </li><li>Yes, he did.
 Which actually probably would have been a smart move,
 but Fred has had wait for four seasons.
 So we waited 11 months and then we got married.
  </li><li>Technically it was four seasons.
  </li><li>Yeah, technically it was.
 All right, give me three things you love
 about John and Carol.
 I love how consistent they are.
 I think they love very well.
 That's number one.
 Yeah.
 Consistent.
 You know they've been leading the longest running revival in church history.
 That's consistency for you.
 But even just consistent on a personal level, you know, we know if we need them, they would
 be available.
 Right. Yeah. Yeah. That's number one. Number one. Number two.
 Just really fun. They are so fun.
 They'll be up for anything fun and funny and adventurous. And yeah,
 and they like food.
 Number three.
 They say maybe not as much as we like food.
 But they like food.
 Number three, they're a great man on Papa for the kids.
 Oh, they are so good.
 I think because they've been fathers so well by having the daddy, they're a really
 good mom and dad, like they're amazing to us.
 And then they're amazing to their grandkids, to our kids.
 They just love them so well.
 And, you know, I love it.
 I think it's one of the sneakiest blessings God has ever given me that, you
 know, my children have multiple sets of grandparents, two of whom are John and Carol
 Arnett, just these amazing revivalists. I just think God, that is so amazing that they have
 that heritage. I just think it's wonderful. I also love that, you know, they often talk
 about the whole thing of their ceiling is our floor, like they really want their kids
 to go farther than they have. And I think I've heard that in tons of places, but they
 live it. I mean, they really mean it. They open doors for you and encourage you and really
 want to help make their ceiling your floor. Absolutely. And they're so earnest in that.
 If I was going to give you my top three things, probably my first one would be there.
 They manage to be humble and fun. Most people who try to be humble come across
 really earnest, but not much fun. But these guys are just so meek and yet so loving at the same
 time. And I just think that's incredible. So you're absolutely right. They have done more
 to help us prosper in ministry than we absolutely deserve. They're incredibly generous
 in sharing their platform with their kids. We just saw them do that all the time with Steve and
 Sandra and thanks and Kate and Stuart and then Lee and us and so many other people. They're just
 amazing at not having to have the limelight. I love that about them. I would say the second
 thing I absolutely love about them is that they have such a high value on the healing of the heart.
 As a result, the same people you see on a stage are the same people off the stage.
 They're exactly the same at home and they're pajamas.
 Yeah, I love that about them. They're absolutely the real deal, 100% genuine. And I just think
 that's remarkable. And then I think of the persecution that they've endured, the criticism,
 the slander, the backbiting, all the politics, and that they've come out with that,
 not offended, more in love with Jesus. I just think that's amazing what they have
 modeled for the world. So it's no wonder that one of the messages they're most known for is
 the importance of forgiveness because they model it and carry it so well.
 Yeah, yeah, they really do.
 So John and Carol, we love you. We love you. And we are so grateful that you have invested your
 lives into the kingdom and produced such amazing dividends. When we look around the globe,
 And when we see the people who are just impacting the kingdom, they all have in common is that they have been touched by your lives.
 And so we are so grateful for you guys.
 What an extravagant gift from God that you guys are to the body and to us personally.
 We feel so fortunate.
 You were saying earlier, Ajay, that again, no exaggeration, you probably wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for them.
 I'm pretty sure I would have successfully killed myself if it wasn't for showing up at their church where the love of God was so evident that it couldn't be ignored.
 You know the other thing I want to just throw in there one of the other things that absolutely changed my paradigm is their view on spiritual warfare.
 I love that they have such confidence in God's love that it leaves no room to worry about the devil.
 I remember us being at a conference and the intercessors panicking and freaking out because
 there was witches in the conference and John's reaction, I don't think I'll ever forget, he was
 like, "Oh, that's wonderful. Maybe they'll get saved." There was no sense that there might be turmoil
 or difficulty. They're just, they're a glorious hope and optimism just based on Jesus was just
 so refreshing. Absolutely amazing. They have an incredible conference coming up. They're
 catch-af-fire conference this year. It's the 24th, the 27th of September. And it's going
 to be an incredible conference. It's all about the miraculous. They have Benny Hinn, James
 Maloney and John and Carolyn, Stephen Sandro all going to be ministering. It's going to
 be an amazing conference. So if you are looking for a filling up a radicalization of your
 faith, you want to see signs and wonders, then I would really encourage you to head
 to Toronto 24th to 27th of September, you can find more information at catchthefire.com.
 And I would love to go to that. Let's see if we can get some time off working for the
 conference. You go to go January. Maybe I get to go in September. I'm sure that's
 Jesus works things.
 Oh no.
 Well, I do Jones any closing thoughts as we wrap up this week's podcast.
 Um, no, not that I can think of.
 I think I hear my pillow calling me.
 Hey, come over here.
 Hey, go listen, gentlemen.
 That was your wisdom.
 I will leave you with this thought.
 Don't fry bacon naked.
 Take a good tip.
