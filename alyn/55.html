<p> a.j. Jones. Yes sir. How are you? Well thank you. What's your favorite thing about today?
 About today. What I made for dinner was my favorite thing about today. Do tell. Well my
 spaghetti squash didn't turn out very well. It turned out kind of like sand. So I think it must be
 really old. So I made zucchini noodles instead and a cashew, creamy cashew sauce with garlic and
 basil and all things good and shrimp. I had an apple with some cashew butter.
 Show off.<br/>
 Just living the dream.<br/>
 Um, this week, I was looking through our week and basically all we did was be in meetings,
 but we did do some fun stuff this weekend.
 We did.<br/>
 What do you want to start with?<br/>
 You can start with what you did.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 This weekend, our church organized a dad and me camp out where all the dads take their
 kids away and they all go camping.<br/>
 The problem with this is I hate camping.
 our children are your children.<br/>
 And they don't really like camping.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 But God bless, Marti and Julie Curly are wonderful children's pastors.
 They said, Alan, if you would like to skip the camping part, we would make provision for
 you and you could just come up for the day.
 With the kids.<br/>
 And I was like, that's very kind of you.
 But in listening to the girls be super excited about this weekend, I realized once I got
 the plan that what they were excited about wouldn't happen because all the stuff they're
 excited about happened outside of the window of time that we were going to be there.
 Except for the zip lining.<br/>
 Except for the zip lining.<br/>
 Which is why we just set up a wire with a coat hanger and just let her go at it from
 the roof of the house.<br/>
 And it worked surprisingly well the first time.
 I mean, it was amazing.<br/>
 So glad you didn't let go.<br/>
 So we decided to set up a tent in the back garden and me and the two girls would sleep
 there.<br/>
 But what was the problem?<br/>
 You didn't fit.<br/>
 The problem was it was a two man tent, but I'm not sure what two men would fit in that
 place.<br/>
 Well, I thought one man and two little girls would probably work.
 But it didn't.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 So we didn't really try.<br/>
 What?<br/>
 No, I can even get in the tent.<br/>
 It was my like portaging tent, like it was a tiny tent so that you could take it places
 and it was fit in your backpack.<br/>
 Yeah, it would fit in my back pocket.<br/>
 Never mind my backpack.<br/>
 It's pretty small.<br/>
 So the girl slept in there.<br/>
 Yes. But as a responsible parent, I didn't just want to leave my children out the back garden overnight.
 In case the bunnies got them. So I slept and I say slept in the loosest of terms in our
 screened in porch in an upright chair. With the bugs. With the bugs. And the sprinklers.
 And the sprinklers and all our neighbors are conditioning units, which come on and all throughout
 the night. But they seem to have a great time. And then the next day, we did an extravaganza
 of daddy daughter date. Yes, you did. And I made a slight faux pas. A slight faux pas.
 Well, I took the kids to five guys for lunch. Well, first you fed them waffles.
 That was a stroke of genius. There was no faux pas there. I understand, but they have tiny
 tummy. Right. And then I took them to five guys, and then I took them to Sweet Cece.
 And in between that, they you took them swimming. And they all had chocolate. But it was Abigail's
 first time ever drinking a Coca-Cola and she was a chipmunk on speed. She wouldn't
 shut up. I'm not surprised. And she just talked and talked and talked and repeated herself.
 Meanwhile, back at the ranch, you were a women's self-defense class.
 I was. We hosted our second women's self-defense class and actually one of our guests today was
 referred to by the man who hosts the class as a ninja. Did you learn anything new at this women's
 defense class that you didn't learn last time?
 Um, it's, it was the same class.<br/>
 It was a good refresher of things that I had forgotten.
 Um, I just really like, uh, Ken's passion for women not, you know, being vulnerable
 or whatever.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 So he's, he just does an amazing job of teaching the class and also telling you what to look
 like so you never have to use the stuff you just taught you.
 I watched a bunch of the videos of the women kicking the living daylights out of the man
 and he takes a beating.
</p><ul>
  <li>20 women, that's why only 20 can do each class.
 20 women get to kick the tar out of him, basically.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>All right, let's jump into our main topic for this week.
 Last week on the podcast,
 we talked about destiny and walking into your destiny,
 the process of all of that.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And we looked at the life of Joseph
 and talked about like, how do you manage life
 while dreaming about what you think you're called to?
 And it was great, he said.
 Yeah, we were awesome.
 We were amazing.
 Perfound even.
 But then we went to church this morning and passage F preached an incredible message on
 exactly the same topic.
 Yes.
 But his message was all about the language of promise and he lived the life of Joseph.
 And as he was sharing and teaching and we'll put a link in the show notes because it's such
 a great message.
 I was thinking about our dear friends, Josh and Sarah Parsons.
 Yes.
 Josh and the ninja Sarah Parsons.
 Josh and the ninja Sarah as she's known around her office because their story just intertwined
 so brilliantly with everything we were talking about last week on the podcast and what Jeff
 was speaking about this morning. So we've asked them to come on the show. Welcome Josh
 and Sarah Parsons.
 Yeah.
 Hello.
 Wait, can we talk about why I'm a ninja? Did he really say that?
 He called you a ninja. He was talking about.
 I'm so honored.
 Beerseness.
 And he said, I think he called you scrappy first and he said she was in ninja.
 Scrappy.
 Mm hmm.
 Is it not because you're Asian?
 Pardon?
 If I am.
 I don't know.
 She's got gumption.
 And then he compared Michelle Vouterstee when Michelle was like kicking him and stuff
 because he was like, wow, I didn't expect you to be able to kick that hard.
 You're like last class is ninja.
 Oh, yeah.
 That's awesome.
 I'm going to add that to my Twitter profile. I think you should ninja ninja.
 Josh and Sarah are the worship and creative arts pastors at Grace Center. And before they were that,
 we worked very closely together at the School of Supernatural Life where they were the school
 pastors. And we've wanted to have you on the show for a long time. Like every time I sit here,
 like, why don't we ask Josh and Sarah on the show? And we could, I mean, I've got a list of questions
 running in my head about like arts and about, you know, the whole worship experience because it's
 It's just unbelievable.
 And so we're going to have to have you back on that because what I wanted to ask you about
 was if you could cover some of your story about how you ended up in Nashville, because
 I know you've only been here, what?
 Five years in September?
 Yeah, about four and a half years.
 But a lot has happened in five years.
 Yes.
 And it's a great story.
 And I'm always encouraged when I hear and I am sure our listeners are going to be super
 encouraged.
 So, Riddle me this, how long have you guys been married?
  </li><li>It'll be nine years in August, August 5th.
  </li><li>And you guys met in school?
  </li><li>We met in college, Sarah saw me from afar and--
  </li><li>Was it all over you like a rush?
  </li><li>Just admired me greatly.
  </li><li>Who could blame her really?
  </li><li>I asked her out, well, I asked her
 if she would wanna go see a movie with me,
 and we dated for a few months,
 and then she broke up with me.
  </li><li>Oh dear.
  </li><li>It was a riveting experience.
 And then 13 months later,
 after a lot of growth and time with the Lord,
 we got back together.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Yay.
  </li><li>And now we're married.
  </li><li>We're very glad that you did.
  </li><li>Yeah, me too.
  </li><li>Me too.
  </li><li>And you've been in Nashville close to five years.
 Tell us the story of how you came to Nashville,
 why you came to Nashville.
 Start there.
  </li><li>Well, after college,
 I had gotten hired to play guitar for a band that lived up near Chicago.
 And I played with them for about four or five years and met a lot of people from Nashville at that time.
 And during that time, we were touring with some people.
 And one of the guys on the bus had been telling us about podcasts from Grace Center.
 And we were familiar with Bethel and Bill Johnson's teachings and Jesus
 culture and all that. And so they said, it's kind of like that they're in Nashville. So we got a
 hold of some of the emanate podcasts of you and AJ teaching. And we would just listen to them in the
 van on the way to shows and stuff. And Sarah used to listen to them a lot.
 Yeah, I would, I was working as a studio manager at a photography studio at the time, and I would
 edit photos for hours and listen to your guys's teachings.
 Which is so surreal.
 I know it's so strange, isn't it?
 I never think about people listening to them in other places.
 Right.
 Yes.
 It was like amazing because I think we were still relatively new to the things of the Holy
 Spirit, but we're very curious.
 And you were teaching practical ways to grow in the prophetic.
 And I was curious about what is speaking in tongues?
 What is the Holy Spirit baptism?
 And then you had a teaching on curious about speaking in tongues.
 And so it was just really what I was looking for at the time.
 It was amazing.
 really life giving.
 So you were, you were, where were you?
 You were working in a photography studio.
 I was a photographer.
 We did mostly wedding photography and studio family portraits.
 And there's a some Valparaiso.
 Valparaiso and you know.
 But Josh was always on the road.
 Yeah, he was touring about 200 days a year.
 Just playing guitar.
 And that would have interesting dynamics on marriage.
 And driving a lot.
 Yes.
 It was very interesting.
 But the one thing you'd have in common is you're listening to the same podcast.
 Well, he's the one who told me about it because we had wondered why we were living in Indiana
 and not Nashville or just somewhere else.
 We were always intrigued about it, but never really considered moving here just because
 we thought, well, we'll just stay in Indiana for now.
 And then our jobs just kind of started changing.
 We were just wanting things, wanting more, wanting to do more.
 And I knew that, well, I knew that there was a good church in Nashville.
 And I was like, well, if anything, we'll know we could go to Grace Center and have kind
 of the same church that we had in Felparaiso.
 And we could just kind of figure things out.
 I knew that I wanted to keep playing guitar a lot more.
 And all that, honestly, it was just kind of like, well, maybe we should check it out.
 It was just kind of a hunch.
 Like...
 Yeah, we didn't really, we knew we didn't want to settle down in Indiana.
 I think our friends were on their second and third baby and buying homes.
 And we just felt that it wasn't a long term place for us.
 And the only other place we had considered was Nashville.
 And it was mostly because the winters were pretty brutal up in Indiana.
 So we knew Nashville would be warmer and we knew there was a good church.
 So you didn't know visitation of an angel.
 No word of the Lord.
 You were just like, no, we look, you know, it's like the weather she or sucks and let's go check it natural.
 It was really just a hey, that might be something. And then that's what we did. We thought, well, we could visit. Maybe if we, you know, we'll visit Gray Center, we'll visit the town and we'll just see if what it feels like.
 I mean, it really wasn't anything significant. It was just a hey, that might be the next step.
 Don't you just love those?
 Yeah, this probably isn't significant, but...
 Yeah, but actually it's probably the most significant.
 Yeah, so we came, we had two visits, we came down
 once in February and I think we both were like, well let's just pray for favor
 and see if there's any open doors.
 I see if it just feels like a good fit for us and we were excited to come to emanate
 to meet you guys or to at least hear you guys
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause he were like celebrities to us.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>We're real celebrities.
 (laughing)
 And M&amp;A was canceled because of like this sleet rain storm.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>They said snow storm.
 Now where we came from, it was like a dusting.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So we were very disappointed when it was canceled.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>And we were heading out of town.
 I remember it was Tuesday, it says,
  </li><li>Yeah, Tuesday after Monday and we stopped in Whole Foods
 and I heard this Scottish accent behind me at a table
 and I was like, "John, I think that sounds like Alan Jones."
 And I had no idea what you looked like
 but I had been listening to your podcast
 so you know, the past year.
 And I was like, "Okay, this feels like favor
 "or something significant."
  </li><li>I didn't think it felt like favor.
 I said, "I'm going to the men's room.
 Don't do anything weird."
 Because you were clearly in a meeting with someone already.
 You were meeting with someone,
 and I was just trying to be, you know,
 keep an appropriate distance.
 But then that meeting ended, and I was like,
 "Oh, wow, I think I should go meet him."
 If that is Alan Jones, I'm going to go over and just say hi.
 That's so funny.
 Because that's so random seemingly.
 So I walked over and introduced myself,
 said, we're thinking about moving here and great to meet you.
 And that was that.
 And that was actually, that was enough for me.
 I was like, Oh Lord, thank you for that.
 That seemed incredibly significant.
 I just wanted some kind of connection.
 And so that was the favor I think I was looking for.
 That's amazing what you saw that as favor.
 Well, it just seemed significant.
 I had prayed, you know, we were so excited for Emonee.
 And when it didn't happen, I just thought, Oh, I really thought we would have met Alan and
 and then when you were there, I just thought,
 oh, well, that's what I was looking for, great.
  </li><li>I have a vague memory of you.
 I think I was sitting on the left
 of that kind of the round part in the green hills.
 And I think I remember who I was meeting with,
 which is unusual, and they just left.
 And I think I remember that very brief interchange,
 "Hey, you know me, my husband, everything,
 "and moving here."
 And I was like, "Oh yeah, that's awesome."
 But I'd completely forgotten it until you told the story.
 But I remember that.
 I remember the second time we met.
 Do you want to talk about that?
  </li><li>So the second time we met was in April, we had,
 so by this point we had decided,
 okay, we're definitely gonna move to Nashville.
 And in April, I got asked to come down
 and play guitar for something.
 And so we came down and we thought,
 well, we'll make a little trip out of it.
 We'll look at apartments or at least check out
 some different areas of town.
 'Cause we didn't, other than I'd been here a few times,
 the time in February was the first time Sarah had ever visited.
 So I was like, we don't even know what Nashville is like
 in terms of the city.
 So let's just drive down, I'll do this little showcase thing
 and then we can look around
 and we wanted to come to church again.
 So we came to church and I believe it was communion Sunday
 and we went down to the front to get our elements
 and you guys were sitting right there
 And they said, "Just gather with some people near you.
 We're gonna kind of take this family style."
 And you guys, you kind of waved us over like,
 "Here, you guys can join us."
 'Cause we probably looked like loss.
 Well, we don't know anyone.
 We have no family, you know?
  </li><li>I don't know why you waved us over.
  </li><li>I know why.
 You know, I'm minding my own business in church.
 Everybody's coming forward for communion.
 And I just happen to see you guys walk past
 and I just think, "Hmm,
 I don't know who they are, but they fit here.
 So for me, whenever favor lights on somebody,
 I always go and inquire what that favor is.
 So like for whatever reason,
 I mean there's hundreds of people at Grace Center
 and there's lots of visitors,
 but out of everybody, you guys stand out.
 You didn't do anything,
 you just went forward and got communion
 and yet the Holy Spirit highlighted you guys
 and I didn't know what that meant,
 but a bit like the burning bush,
 I just went over and said,
 "I wonder what this thing is."
 And so that's why I went over to you guys and said, hey, come here to see what it was.
 Isn't that funny?
 That's amazing.
 And then we had lunch.
 You invited us for lunch.
 That's right.
 We went to Garcia's.
 Yes.
 We're eating lunch with Alan and Ete.
 We don't even live here yet.
 So what happened was we connected over communion, something as simple as communion.
 And I thought, gosh, I want to get to know them a little bit better.
 Again, just following that favor, like we see favor on you.
 So we go over and see what it is.
 We're still not sure what it is.
 So we go the next time, say, can we have lunch together?
 And we need to talk about favor at some point, continue.
 So we have lunch together.
 And have you moved it there at this point?
  </li><li>No, you guys were like, well, let us know
 when you move here, I guess.
 We just connected and we got to know each other more.
 We told you a little bit more about our story
 and that we were coming down in September.
 And that was that, we moved in September
 and everything in our life seemingly felt like
 it was falling apart.
  </li><li>Yeah. - After we came.
 Yeah, we got here feeling so favored.
 Which we were.
 We were at the church, but all of our job stuff,
 it just seemed to like.
 Well, talk about that.
 So you move, and presumably you have some expectations
 in your head of what it's gonna be like.
 Yeah, we had met with our pastor in Indiana,
 and there was just like a big yes,
 we believe in you, this feels right.
 And then after all of our visits to Nashville,
 and the favor just felt like, yeah, this is right.
 This isn't a good move for us.
 And while things were winding down in both of our jobs,
 at least in my mind, I thought, well, Shirley Lorde,
 you're just gonna take us on to bigger and better things.
 And I'm gonna get a better job doing what I love to do.
 And Josh will get an even better gig in music.
  </li><li>'Cause he's in the music city.
  </li><li>Yeah, of course.
 And we're moving to a really creative town.
 And you're saying yes, you're saying yes to go.
 So Shirley will all just be easy.
 Not so much.
 It was not easy.
 It was really hard actually those first six months when we came.
 Every door that was initially opened, Josh had had a couple interests in him coming out
 with some guys on the road and those doors closed and I had some photography possibilities
 in those doors closed and we started to run out of money.
 we were like looking at each other like, "What do we do?"
  </li><li>Yeah. - What if you said, "Yes,
 "I remember all of the words
 "and we had such peace about coming here.
 "What are we doing here?"
 And so we ended up getting jobs at coffee shops
 and just doing what we had to do to pay our bills
 and we're just feeling a little bit lost.
  </li><li>Like I'm sure in the middle of it,
 you don't have a clue what's going on.
 Now, looking back, do you have any insight
 into what was going on?
  </li><li>Oh yeah. - Yeah.
  </li><li>There was a moment, I think for me at least,
 where I was sitting on our couch in our living room,
 just crying, like, "Lord, why did we move here?
 "What are we even doing?
 "Do you even hear my prayers?"
 And then I was like, "Are you even real?"
 And then I was like, "Did I just ask that?"
 It's all the time that I've had the Lord,
 you know, powerfully move in our lives,
 and all, like, in my life, and all of the testimonies.
 I can't believe that my faith is so shaken
 because of our present circumstances.
 And I now, looking back,
 feel like it was really important for me to realize what my faith was built on and that it was
 pretty shaken by my circumstances and I needed to change some things which was incredible. I didn't
 think I knew what I believed until it was challenged. So I think it was really important for us to go
 through that and to make sure that we knew, yes, that the Lord's God has, yes, that his promises are
 true, even when it doesn't feel like it presently.
 What about you, Josh?
 Yeah, I just remember thinking, you know, it was kind of like the
 Israelites when they were led into the desert where they were
 kind of like, well, at least in Egypt, we had food.
 And I remember hitting a moment where we were like, well, let's
 just move back and ask for old jobs.
 And you know, even though we weren't feeling fulfilled and
 necessarily like wanting to settle down in Indiana, at least we
 had food, at least we had favor in those jobs. And oh, you know, I guess I could just do
 that. That'd be fine. You know, I guess I could, I could decide to be happy in that.
 And you know, I remember feeling kind of like Lord was like, well, that's it. That's all
 you want. And I just didn't know, I didn't know what else to do. And I remember we actually
 went back through Valparaiso over Christmas. We were driving up to Michigan to visit family.
 And I remember going through town and thinking, "This is it. We're going to reconnect with
 our friends and the town." And I just remember feeling like this doesn't feel right. We're
 not meant to be back here. And for the first time, that was when Nashville felt like home,
 though like our apartment, we still had boxes stacked up like in the corners like, you know,
 it just, I just thought. Was it the bat apartment? Yes, we, you know, we hadn't discovered that
 it was infested with bats yet, but yeah, that came later. So I just, but I remember thinking,
 even though like, yeah, the neighborhood we were in, it was pretty shady at the time, it's beautiful
 now, but at the time it was really shady. I was like, uh, this feels more like home than that did.
 but I'm still very uncomfortable.
  </li><li>And I'm not trying to put words in your mouth
 to make your story fit my narrative.
 But was there any sense that you guys were dying?
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
  </li><li>Like as in, you're just expecting,
 so you're both super skilled creatively.
 Like Sarah, you're a phenomenal painter
 and photographer, Josh, you're an exceptional guitarist.
 And of course you're in this city
 that really, really values and endorses those things.
 I wonder, was there a sense that you were thinking, okay, this is the avenue that's
 going to fulfill us.
 Just all those things just died.
 Oh yeah, absolutely.
 I think we both had expectations that it was like onto bigger and better things because
 we both left college and found favor immediately in both of our professions.
 So we just felt like, Lord, thank you, of course.
 Onward and upward and it was not happening.
 It's so funny because what you're doing now,
 I'm again, I'm just guessing here's a crime from wrong.
 What you're doing now, I would imagine isn't what you would have want to have done.
 For example, you know, you want to be a painter, you want to be a guitarist.
 And along comes Lawrence's, hey, why don't you guys be pastors?
 Like, yeah, that would just be like, no, no.
 No. So I remember thinking, so I had, I think I was confronted with the reality of maybe
 I'm not, maybe I'm not as good as I thought I was. You know what I mean? Like, I just
 thought, oh, we have all this favor. We have these opportunities. We're going to get there
 and it's going to be perfect. We're just going to walk right into these awesome jobs.
 And when they all fell through, you know, a lot of them fell through for just random
 different reasons that nothing we could even be mad about. It was just like, oh, that makes
 total sense. You guys canceled your tour because your singer's having a baby. You can't be mad
 about that. Random things like that. But then when nothing else would come along, like every
 connection or thing that seemed promising, I remember getting an audition for a really
 now incredible country band and thinking, "This is it. Here we go. This is two months in
 and never heard anything back. And I was just kind of shattered. I just thought,
 wow, I must have had like American Idol syndrome where I thought, yes, I am the next American Idol
 guitar player. And I was just completely wrong about myself. So the only thing we had going at the
 time was our coffee shop jobs. And there was plenty of church services to be at. So we would come every
 Sunday and Monday and take every free class that was available.
 And I remember even thinking, man, I'm probably not even good enough to play at church.
 Like boy, I went from I would love to tour stadiums to man, I would just like to be
 able to play at church.
 If somebody thought I was good enough to play at church, that would be cool.
 That was it.
 Correct me if I'm wrong, but you guys were getting promoted in your coffee shops.
 So we've got had you.
 He was promoting you, but it didn't feel like life at the time.
 That's true.
 Yeah, that was true.
 We did have a lot of favor there.
 And we looked at where we had favor, which was seemingly only the church.
 And so that's where we got involved, which is one of the following favor.
 And yeah, that is we signed up for everything we could.
 And it was the first time in our marriage that we were together that much.
 So we really grew a lot together, learned a lot.
 I wish people could see your faces.
 Oh my goodness.
 Life like we just course and changed our entire life.
 Took day Ramsey,
 by and it learned about our money.
 I mean, it was just a really challenging
 but good season for us in our marriage.
 And then the Lord started putting on my heart.
 Like, maybe we should do a school.
 We've never been together this long.
 You know, we considered Bethel
 or just some kind of ministry school.
 And then you announced the school of supernatural life
 and something just dropped in my spirit.
 And I was like, oh, yeah, that's why we're here.
 That's it.
 That's what I want to do.
 But we had no money.
 And I still thought that would be really great for Sarah
 to do that.
 I'm going to get a great gig and pay for her to do that.
 That would be great.
 It still wasn't on my radar.
 So funny.
 But we prayed about that.
 And then you guys asked us to dinner, I think,
 over at your house.
 And we didn't know why.
 We were still like, what?
 Why?
 And you asked us to help you be leaders in the first year of the school as you were launching it to attend for free and then to help lead and learn how to lead a small group.
 And I was just like, Oh, Lord, wow.
 Like I was trying to come up with a way for just me to go and then maybe Josh could come later and you just completely open the door for us both to go together and to learn together.
 And that was the beginning was indeed.
 I love listening to this story because when I listen to this story,
 I think of how it could have turned out.
 How do you guys made any other decisions, which the Lord would have honored?
 What advice or comfort or wisdom do you have for people who were,
 who are in the season of life we just described where you're gifted,
 you're talented, you have passion.
 And yet the only job you can get is serving people coffee,
 working in an environment you don't want to.
 Like, how do you balance that between, you know, what you hope for, what you thought
 God was going to do, and yet you find yourself, you know, not excelling in those areas?
 Like, what cancel would you give people?
 I would say that God's timing is always good and that.
 So in my experience, when I would pray or journal about God, these are the desires of
 my heart, get me out of this coffee shop, or any other thing that I felt like was killing
 me slowly.
 I felt like he kind of gave me a choice.
 He was like, "Okay, I know you want to do this.
 Would you do this?"
 And it was like, "I know you want to play guitar for a living.
 That's all you really want to do."
 Hey, but for now, would you consider doing this school?
 And every time I felt like the only thing I could do was just say,
 yeah, yeah, I guess I would do that.
 You know, and it was just kind of like these little choices.
 I know you really want to do that.
 Would you do this?
 Would you consider doing this?
 And it wasn't in the opposite of what I wanted to do.
 It was just kind of like a, Hey, that's really great that you love that.
 Look over here for a sec.
 Would you do this?
 And I felt like every time that I kind of felt frustrated
 or wanted to quit or whatever,
 he would just present me with another little,
 hey, would you try this?
  </li><li>And how ironic in a one sense
 that what he's asking you to do
 doesn't get you any closer to what you want to do.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Right?
 So like, you know, hey, I know you really wanna play guitar.
 I know you really wanna be a photographer,
 but would you just manage this coffee shop?
 Would you just do really, really well
 on your boss while pouring coffee
 for a really grumpy businessman, right?
 Or hey, would you go to school or whatever?
 And you're like, I will go do that Lord
 because you've asked me to, it's a bit like Peter, you know?
 Well, okay, carpenter boy, we have been fishing all night
 but because you say, well, and so you doing all those things,
 even saying yes, doesn't make it look like
 you're getting any closer to your goal.
 But suddenly God goes,
 Why don't you guys run the whole worship and creative arts of this church that's known
 around the nation for worship and creative arts?
 Or even before that, really, like coming on staff as the pastors at the school, like you'd
 learn how to manage people already, you know?
 And grumpy people who wanted their coffee and wanted their, what you're doing mean?
 Snickerdoodle.
 It was all training.
 It's just you had no idea you were actually in training.
 Yeah, I would absolutely agree with that.
 Nothing is wasted.
 Everything, exactly where you are right now,
 is used and useful.
 It's either building character or experience
 for what's to come.
 So I think my greatest thing I would tell people
 is to not quit to keep moving forward.
 Yeah, I think because the Lord is so faithful,
 like he's gonna work it all out if you keep saying yes.
 'cause there was so many moments where you could have been like,
 "We're done with this, this is too hard."
 But it's always better with the Lord.
 So I can't imagine not continually saying yes.
  </li><li>I think with that too, I was looking back.
 I'm really thankful that he didn't give me
 some of the things that I really wanted.
 'Cause I've talked to people that travel full time
 and they're gone seven months in a row before they,
 I talked to a friend who's like,
 I've been on the road for the last eight months and I've slept in my own bed with my wife six times.
 And the amount of time that we've been able to spend together over the last four and a half, five years,
 it's more than we've ever been able to spend together.
 And I wouldn't trade that for, you know, the best guitar playing job in the world.
 Oh, oh, let's hold hands.
 You can't see this right now, but we are embracing.
 I think to Josh when I reflect on you guys and just how the Lord has set you guys up,
 you know, in the last couple of years, like I keep thinking about how you even had, it
 wasn't just that you wanted to be a musician.
 You absolutely did not want to be a pastor.
 Yeah, not at all.
 You absolutely didn't want to be a small group leader, you know what I mean?
 And it was like, it was the kindness of God that he just sort of wooed you into, "No,
 look, see, see, I built you for this."
 You know what I mean?
 "Look, it's not as bad as you think it is."
 That kind of stuff.
 So I just, I love that about your story too.
 I love that you guys were obedient and followed,
 but I love God's heart towards you.
 In that he kind of wooed you into finding out
 what he actually made you for.
  </li><li>It's funny because my yes to him wasn't even a strong yes.
 We've talked about this before where I think
 it was the second year of the school
 and even asked us to come back and kind of help
 lead the other small group leaders.
 And literally, you know, I was journaling about it,
 God, should I do this?
 And I felt like the Lord was saying,
 would you do this?
 And all I wanted to do was to not do it anymore
 and just go play guitar some more.
 And, but I wasn't at a point yet where I could do that
 full time.
 So I was still like working at a coffee shop.
 And I remember like holding up my hands like,
 Do the school keep working at a coffee shop.
 I guess I'd rather keep doing the school.
 Okay, yeah, I'll do it.
 And it was like literally that much of a yes.
 Like I guess I'd rather do that.
 This is a worthy investment of my time
 at least serving their vision.
  </li><li>I think that's just so funny
 that God will use our feeble yeses.
 And I wonder if the reason you didn't get to go
 play more guitar is that thing hadn't died yet. Yeah. Yeah.
 You know, so he's, it's a bit like that whole Joseph thing of, you know, when he interprets
 the dreams of the cup bearer and the baker, like, Hey, remember me, you know, I'm still
 here, you know, he's still looking to rely on his gift, you know, and other people to
 promote him rather than letting God do it. Yeah. And so, you know, it's not that you
 want to play guitars bad at all. And you know, the Lord, you know, this is what you do.
 You know the Lord had to kill he's so good at killing off stuff that would would rob the
 Future that he has for us. That whole thing of good is often the worst enemy of best
 Mm-hmm, and yet we often don't agree with God's best. Mm-hmm. Like how is this best?
 Or we don't even know what his best is
 But God was so faithful like he was so gentle with us
 Because you guys asked us to come back and we were like I guess so and you had said we want you to try on being a pastor
 because of course you didn't know what you needed in the school.
 And then that second year was like, wait, are we pastors now?
 Lord, the only favor we've gotten in the church is in pastoring.
 And prophetic words now are coming in about pastoring.
 I want to pay attention to what you're saying, but now I'm really confused because my heart
 is still burning for things that are creative and Josh is still really wanting to play guitar.
 Then in his kindness, he sent another prophetic word from James Goll.
 Oh yeah.
 And we were so funny because it was nearing the end of that second year.
 And we were just like, wow, okay, Lord, we want to be obedient, but this is feeling hard.
 This is so not what we had planned.
 Are we even pastors?
 And James Goll came to emanate and had delivered, you know, a couple of prophetic words.
 And then at the end, I was like, actually, I had one more word.
 It was a dream.
 Last night, Charlie Brown came to me in a dream and said, "Find the Parsons.
 The Parsons are pastors."
 Yeah, that was pretty clear.
 I just felt like, like, the floor weeping because I knew, I knew, obviously, that word
 was for us.
 Oh, I was hoping my brother was there and it was for him.
 We were so funny, but what was the significance of the Charlie Brown thing?
 Because I remember that was significant for you.
 We just, my whole family.
 We just always loved Charlie Brown.
 We would watch, we'd start watching Charlie Brown Christmas
 in like October and put it, you know,
 the vinyl on the stereo and stuff.
 And we've just, oh, we had like all the movies,
 like it's Christmas, Charlie Brown, you know,
 it's Christmas again, Charlie Brown,
 Happy New Year, Charlie Brown,
 it's the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown.
 And we would read the comics
 and I had all these little, you know,
 woodstock and Snoopy Pez dispensers and stuff.
 like it was just this thing that we loved.
 And so for James Gull to say,
 Charlie Brown appeared to me in a dream
 and said, find the Parsons.
 And it's a play on words
 because the word "Parson" means pastors.
 The Parsons are pastors.
 And I just like,
 I would say that was the beginning
 of the real dying process.
 'Cause that was the first time I knew.
 Really the Lord was clearly saying.
  </li><li>I think we both were,
 I mean, we were both seeking the Lord,
 but we're still feeling really confused.
 Like if you've put these dreams and desires in us,
 but you're only opening doors here, are we missing it?
 And I actually prayed like, I journaled,
 "Lord, please take this other desire away
 "so that I can align myself with what you're calling us to do."
 I'm just so confused.
 And so after that word, it was such a loud, public,
 prophetic word that I was like,
 "Okay, well, we've got no other choice
 "than to just say yes to God."
 And like, we're all in.
 we're gonna, you know, we say yes to pastoring.
  </li><li>But here's the thing, you say we have no other choice.
 You could have walked away.
  </li><li>That's true.
  </li><li>You could have said no, that was for my brother.
  </li><li>We almost did walk away that summer
 because we were still like that summer,
 why I say it was like the most dying moment
 was because after that year of the school,
 I think James gave us the word in March or February,
 and we finished out that school year,
 And it was during that summer that we had more than four visits from bats in our apartment.
 We got Salmonella poisoning.
 I threw my back out and then I hit my face on a rocket bus and my tooth.
 That's true.
 I'm in a river.
 That's a little rock bottom.
 I literally hit rock bottom in a river and our car broke down and we were like, God, if you want us to be pastors, that's great.
 But we need a car that runs.
 we need, you know, we need health.
  </li><li>Can we talk about the saddest conversation
 that we've ever had?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>'Cause I wanna talk a little bit about the role
 of leaders.
 But before we do that, I think it's so important
 that just seeing you guys telling your story,
 one of the things I wanna tease out of it is
 favor isn't enough.
 Favor will show you the direction,
 but favor without obedience.
  </li><li>And faithfulness and hard work is diddly squat.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so, you know, I think a lot of people get disillusioned
 because there's favor, but then there's hard work.
 Everyone loves favor.
 Not everybody loves the hard work.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>And you guys worked hard everywhere.
 And that was one of the things we would just look at you.
 You were hard workers everywhere.
 You know, you're hard workers in the restaurant,
 in the coffee shops.
 You know, when you were with us, you were hard workers.
 And, you know, that's an incredible thing
 that I think people wanna overlook.
 Let me talk about the role of leaders in your life
 and that you guys can comment on this.
 So I remember, A.G. and I would meet with you,
 as your leaders at that point in the school.
 And we'd just meet and just talk about how are you doing.
 And I remember one time we were at Frothy Monkey
 in downtown Franklin.
 And we were out on the patio
 and you were just going through the season
 that you were just describing.
 You had bats, an infestation in your,
 I mean, it was just this comical list
 of desperate situations.
  </li><li>Ridiculous. - Oh my gosh.
 And yet what you didn't know was your leaders, me and AJ and Jeff and Tony and McGlaurin,
 had been speaking that very weak about recognizing the call of God that was on your life, like
 just recognizing like guys, like, you know, he is faithful and the small, you know, will
 be given much and we just watched you serve us so faithfully and we were about to officially
 make you pastors.
 We're about to put you on staff.
 We're about to give you like a salary you could live from because prior to this, we were
 just giving you like a step-end. And so you were, you know, you were being barely surviving.
 Like you were having to work really, really hard other jobs to come and work with us.
 And you know, we were like, okay, I think, you know, the school's doing well enough that we could
 afford full-time pastor salaries, but we didn't know when we were still praying about it. And so,
 you know, we're listening to you just go, you know, everything you just said, like, is this
 even going to work? You know, maybe it's at the point where we now need to just think about our
 family and you need to make a living and we can't say anything and you don't know that
 your pastors behind closed doors are planning your promotion literally.
 And I remember we went looking at houses together.
 Yeah, we went by apartment.
 Oh yeah.
 And you were just in despair because you're like, "How could we ever afford this?"
 And we're like, "We know what your salary is about to be.
 You will be able to...
 But we couldn't say anything."
 And so hard.
 And in the gap between what God's planning and where you are, how did you survive that?
 Well, we asked you, we asked for your wisdom.
 We got prophetic words that we held on to.
 And I think we just we believed them.
 So we kept moving forward.
 We were close to quitting.
 Oh, yeah.
 Once once I once I knocked my tooth out, that was really, I don't know why, but it
 was like if you could say hitting rock bottom, it was literally like, that's it.
 Now I don't have a tooth.
 And for some reason, that was the last straw.
 Like you don't have the money to fix your money.
 Exactly.
 There was, you know, there's bats in our apartment.
 We had bats, mice, roaches, all kinds of crazy stuff.
 And then our car started having issues and we were like, we were having real
 conversations like, so at what point do you kind of cut your losses?
 And, you know, we were talking about like moving back to Michigan and living in
 my parents basement and becoming substitute teachers or something just until we could
 figure out what to do next.
 And to be fair, you're trying to be,
 you really weren't running away from anything.
 You were just trying to be practical to the cards
 that life had dealt you.
 Like, we need to be responsible.
 We've done Dave Ramsey.
 Like, right, you know, this isn't,
 and we're just like, and what was interesting for us is
 we can't manipulate.
 We can't tell you, and we can, all we can do is pray.
 And our hearts going out to you going,
 I know that probably within three weeks,
 we can make you an offer, but right now I can't say a thing.
 right? I remember you guys being you were encouraging you were like, you were so gracious and so
 just hang in there. You know, it's unto something, all of these prophetic words. And I think,
 I think we did, we held on to that as long as we could. And I think the Lord knew that too. And
 then the seasons changed. And they changed significantly. You've had a suddenly. We did. It was,
 Well, I remember you gave a prophetic word.
 You were M seeing and it was August and it just turned to August.
 And you said, eight is new beginnings.
 And this is the eighth month.
 So this is the season of new beginnings.
 And I was like, yes, it is.
 That was for the whole group.
 It wasn't just for us.
 I am taking that, you know, as a personal word, though, God, let this be a new
 beginning.
 And then it was that week.
 It was all within the span of that week.
 You guys met with us.
 We were offered to be the school pastors to come on Grey Center staff.
 And then we went house shopping.
 Yeah, we were.
 Just another story.
 I don't know how many details you want, but it was just all of a sudden.
 The apartment that we thought we wanted didn't happen in Josh.
 We'd been researching and dreaming, you know, for months about things we
 was hoping for, but never seemed possible.
 All of a sudden felt possible.
 And we ended up looking at a house.
 Our offer was picked over the other offers.
 It all happened within like one day.
 We made an offer on a house and that day it got accepted and you got given a car and we got given a car.
 We yeah, because our car was still broken.
 So someone had called the church and I was saying, Hey, I've got three more weeks paid insurance on this car.
 We purchased a new one.
 Do you know if anyone who needs to use a car in Tony was like, Oh, there's a couple moving.
 Yeah, I'm sure they could use it.
 So we borrowed the car and then the next Sunday, he came with the other set of keys and said,
 we just feel like the Lord told us to give this to you.
 So it was like new job, new house, new car, all within the span of a week.
 It was amazing.
 Amazing.
 Everything changed in a week.
 Everything did change in a week.
 But last people, because the danger is, and we've taught, you know, the four of us have
 talked about this a lot, there's a danger that people listen to this and think, yeah, well,
 that's you or they just.
 what they don't see is behind the scenes, you were making declarations.
 Yeah.
 One of the things I just want to honor you for Sarah is you are the declaration queen.
 So you didn't just listen to a prophetic word and go, "Yeah, well, let's see if new
 beginnings happen." You were like, "Yes, before it happened, I declare that there will be new
 beginnings." And I declare that we're going to have this size. And I declare that we're going
 to have this car. And I've just seen time and time again. You guys declare things and they come to
 to pass. It's amazing. It's kind of crazy because we had coffee one time and because we just kind of,
 we knew that declaring things was a value. We valued that. So we would get coffee. We'd save up
 some money and get coffee. And I had this wish list right there. We'd save up money and get coffee.
 Well, I mean, Nashville. Right. I got to it. It's really good coffee. Okay.
 There's no Tim Hortons here.
 So we had this wish list on my phone,
 and it was like extravagant wishes.
 And we were sharing a computer at the time,
 which is difficult, sharing a computer, sharing a car.
 And Sarah was like, well, I want my own computer.
 Put that on the wish list.
 You know what, I want an iPad mini too.
 Put that on the wish list.
 And I want a three bedroom, two bath house,
 and I want a new car.
 And so we just wrote all these things down.
  </li><li>I mean, this was like pie in the sky dreaming
 of the time. - Oh yeah, everything.
  </li><li>I just felt, wow, maybe someday Lord.
  </li><li>And we were looking at it what, like a year ago,
 I was just flipping through notes on my phone
 and I found this wish list.
 And I'm like, babe, you have your own computer
 and you got an iPad mini and we live
 in a three bedroom, two-bath house
 and somebody gave us a car like, oh my gosh.
 And we made another one with other cars,
 with like specific models,
 'cause we do this all the time now.
 And we literally outside are those two
 exact specific models of cars
 that we just randomly got crazy deals and...
  </li><li>Can I speak into that for a second?
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>Because I can already hear some of the thoughts
 of the listeners, like thinking,
 "That's food, dude, that's witchcraft."
 That's just, you know.
  </li><li>Name it, claim it.
  </li><li>Name it, claim it.
  </li><li>You know, blab it and grab it.
 And the thing is that those principles are working
 whether you're making declarations or not.
 Exactly.
 If you're not making declarations, you really are,
 but you're just thinking in your head,
 I'm never gonna get a new car and you never get a new car.
 You're thinking, you know, probably the best
 I can ever afford is X and the best your level of forward
 is X.
 So you're actually partnering with those principles
 whether you know or not.
 So you may as well take authority over what your mind
 is thinking and actually speak things that are in accordance
 with God's will.
 We need to do a proper teaching on that.
 Yeah.
 And I love actually, I love how in staff meetings, often somebody will say something funny,
 whether it's like just joking around like, "Oh, I'm so stupid and Sarah will pipe up with
 your words are a verbal contract."
 You know.
 No, you're not.
 You're amazing.
 You're amazing.
 You're amazing.
 Well, I mean, if we believe the Bible, it says, "I love it though."
 It's made me think.
 Well, it always reminded me.
 So I read this Bible study years ago.
 about, was it the widow that went to the king demanding justice and she would go every day,
 every day? And eventually he was just like, fine, I'll give you what you want, just so you'll stop
 pestering me. And it says, how much more does the Lord love to answer the requests of his children?
 And basically, the premise of the Bible study was if you have, you know, if you have something
 that you are dreaming of that you want from the Lord, he wants to know what that is. And so to
 tell him and he talked about like, if a child goes to their parents and says, I really want
 this red bicycle for Christmas. Dad, I want this red bicycle for Christmas. Dad, I want,
 I really want this red bicycle for Christmas. Like when Christmas rolls around, they know
 exactly what to get him because he's been telling what he wants. So I don't know. So
 I just thought, well, you know, if God's a good dad, then let's try that. So I'm like,
 Lord, I want this car with and I have it.
 It's weird.
 I don't it sounds weird, but it's it happens.
 It is amazing.
 Guys can absolutely amazing.
 All right.
 Let's bring this to a close because we're only like a quarter of the way through your
 story.
 Yeah.
 Oh, right.
 Well, right.
 So you do the school.
 That's amazing.
 And we have the opportunity where we need somebody to help look after our worship
 team. And so guess, you know, Josh, you play on a worship team, probably more than anybody
 else on a consistent basis at that time. So we were like, Hey, and you're already pastors.
 And we saw the fruit that blossomed. You know, we put you, it's a bit like Joseph,
 we put you in charge of the school and things just blossomed and flourished. And so we're like,
 great. You know, whatever you're touching is flourishing. Would you just steward the worship
 team while we are interviewing for worship pastors? And what did you guys think?
 Well, I thought, wow, I'm really honored.
 And it kind of caught me off guard at first.
 I honestly have to be getting thought.
 Seriously, me, there's got to be somebody else who's way more qualified.
 Kind of what I thought every other thing that you've asked us.
 Would you guys be interested in doing this?
 There's got to be someone way more qualified.
 And when you and Jeff kind of explain like, well, you're already a pastor
 and you're here all the time and you play all the time and people know you.
 It kind of makes sense.
 I thought, great.
 Yeah, absolutely. I would love to help out until you guys find the right person for this job.
 And it was probably months that I would still think, man, I wonder who's going to be the new
 worship pastor. And it just never, it didn't dawn on me. I don't know. What do you think, Sarah?
 Oh, well, I think we were both a little like, okay, we, I mean, we're just helping out. We're
 running to serve however we can as there was some transition going on. We were really involved
 in the worship team. Josh was always playing and I had painted a couple times and many of our
 friends and community were already on the worship team. So it was fine. It was more just like,
 okay, we'll hold down the floor. We'll do what we can, but we also have this full-time job in the
 school. Right, but you'd never really wanted to be worship pastors. Oh, no. I don't think we'd ever
 considered that.
 Right. I remember, well, in my head too, because neither of us are singers, I thought,
 oh, that wouldn't make sense. Right.
 Because, yeah, I just kind of decided, I remember talking to you or Pastor Jeff, and I just thought,
 I just kind of had this fleeting thought, like, I wonder what it would be like if we had like
 a pastor who was kind of, you know, helping out all the worship leaders. So it wasn't like the
 the pastor was also the main worship leader.
 So they kind of had to do everything.
 I just remember thinking, oh, that could be cool.
 You know, I wonder who would be good for that job.
 And I remember the Lord kind of going, you might.
 Like just like that.
 And I immediately was like, no, no, no, I couldn't do that.
 You know, I don't know, not like, not like completely denying it
 or saying no, but just like, no, I don't think that.
 And I thought I was being prideful,
 like who are you to think you could be,
 the worship pastor at Grace Center?
 Like there are amazing people
 who have been the worship pastors at Grace Center.
  </li><li>For sure.
  </li><li>And honestly, that was one of the things
 that I was really intimidated by.
 I was like, you know, you have people like Luke Finch
 and Chris McLaurney and who are like--
  </li><li>Amazing people.
  </li><li>Arguably, you know, yeah,
 some of the most amazing people I've ever met
 and I just thought, oh, you know,
 I'm not worthy to string their guitars.
 Kind of, you know what I mean?
 Like I just thought this is so far out there.
  </li><li>But what happened because obviously you now do that.
 And obviously we came and offered you that job,
 but like how did your heart begin to percolate thinking
 this might be something you want to do?
 Because the difference when, you know,
 Jeff came and asked you guys,
 would you like to be the worship pastors?
 It was, we didn't get the sense that was,
 you were just being obedient like you had in the previous.
 It definitely felt like this fit.
 Your passions came online.
 Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
 At what point did that happen?
  </li><li>It was like six months or something.
 And during that time, the Lord had really been speaking
 to me about believing what he says about me.
 And 'cause when I would journal,
 I would, you know, when you journal
 and you ask the Lord, Lord,
 well, how do you feel about me?
 And he says these wonderful things
 and you write them down, but to, I don't know,
 to talk about those just feels weird.
 So there were things that I had,
 I felt like I had heard the Lord said
 and I had written down.
 But then going from that to like being asked,
 "Would you be willing to do this job?"
 The amount of work that it took the Lord to do on my heart
 between that time was crazy.
 And, but I feel like, I mean,
 I'm still kind of wrestling with it a little bit.
 Like, "Am I really doing this?
 "Am I really cut out for this?"
 And I'm still having to choose to say, God, I believe you.
 I believe what you say about me and that I can do this.
  </li><li>I think during that time, we both, we had one moment,
 I don't know if you remember this, Josh,
 but we both were standing in the kitchen.
 And I think it was just after you had had that thought,
 like, I wonder if there would be ever like a pastor
 that oversaw all of the worship people.
 And I was like, driving home from church,
 I was wondering if they would ever be a pastor that would like oversee all of the creatives
 and the musicians.
 Like you remember that.
 And we had this moment where we talked about it and we're like, okay, well, it's nothing
 that we could make happen.
 So we just let it go.
 And we just didn't talk about it.
 We, I think both didn't feel peace about bringing it up.
 And we trusted the Lord would talk to our leaders in the right time.
 So we actually, you know, we didn't know what you guys were thinking and I knew that many
 people were sending in applications and yeah, so we were just trying to be faithful with
 all of that.
 And then Jeff in November straight up asked like, what do you, what do you guys love?
 What do you really, really want?
 That's right.
 And we both were like, well, we're both worshipers.
 We love creativity and arts and music and that's what we would do.
 Even if we weren't paid, that's what we do in our spare time, that's what we do already.
 I don't know what that means, but that's our heart.
 Then that's the process of basically just creating this new role and position for us,
 which is so like I get emotional thinking back on it because we could have never done
 this on our own.
 And we couldn't have even known that this would have been what we wanted,
 but now because of this series of many yeses over and over and over,
 we're now in this role that feels like too good to be true and better than we
 could have ever imagined and perfectly fit for us.
 And we're just at the beginning of it.
 So.
 And what's crazy is I think the dying process made room for these new dreams.
 Yeah.
 You know, it had to die.
 The land had to be kind of scorched.
 Yeah.
 New plant seeds could be planted for this thing to blossom.
 I think too, like one of the things about your story, which is just a really good
 example is you guys didn't crowbar your way into anything.
 You just said yes, and then you waited until God opened the door.
 Yeah.
 And, you know, I think that that's a huge thing that people need to learn, you
 you know, as you're processing, moving forward with the Lord, that you don't make your own
 way forward, but you pray and you agree, and then you watch and you wait, you know, and
 in that process, you're going to learn patience and all the other stuff that you're going to
 need for where he's taking you.
 Yeah.
 But I think you guys have done so well at that.
 Thank you.
 Yeah.
 I was just laughing that in all the jobs you've had at Grace Center, you've never applied
 for any of them.
 Yeah.
 I remember when I was like,
 when you were thinking about making us the--
  </li><li>Small group leader.
  </li><li>Small group leader leaders.
 And you didn't even know that I had managed
 your experience or really had any idea.
 I was like, oh, well, I can help maybe
 with some organization.
  </li><li>But that's so funny to you.
  </li><li>That just tells you too.
 Like God, I mean, God was talking to us about you guys
 when we had no idea about that stuff.
 But just like the Lord was highlighting you guys again
 saying, hey, wait, wait, wait, look over here.
 like, you know, so he's so able to do that.
 Yeah.
 One of the things that so my brain works very, it's very linear, like a straight
 line. So I remember.
 So when James Gull gave us that word, that was actually, that was obviously like a
 life changing moment.
 And I remember thinking, I remember journaling with the Lord and him just kind
 asking me, what do you think? And I remember thinking, well, I feel like it's obvious that you want us to be pastors. And he was like, yeah.
 And he said, what kind of pastor do you want to be? And I just thought, well, I'd like to do, I like playing guitar still. That hasn't gone away.
 I'd love to do stuff with musicians and artists and things like that.
 And that was probably that was probably when James gave us the word.
 So a couple of years ago, but I still never, I never thought it was for any, you know what I mean?
 Like I just thought, oh, that was a nice question.
 You know, but I never in my wildest dreams did I ever think that we would be the
 worship and arts pastors at Gray Center because.
 But here's the crazy thing.
 And with this, I want to bring this to a close is once we've made you that offer,
 you start looking at all your old prophetic words from like five, six, seven years ago.
 And they all pointed to this.
 Yeah.
 Crazy.
 But you would never have interpreted them in those light.
 Mm hmm.
 You know, it's just, it's back to that prophetic words are easier on the student
 hindsight than they are in foresight.
 Yeah.
 You know, Jeff was speaking this morning and had some great lines,
 but one of the things he was talking about that verse in Psalms where it talked about how the word
 Tested Joseph, you know until you know a certain time and Jeff said this he said you want the you know
 Whenever you get a prophetic word what we want is we want the word to fit us
 But what God wants is for us to fit the word
 Yeah, and I thought that oh my gosh if that's not the whole summation of walking in the prophetic I
 I don't know what is right and so that whole five years that you've been here has been death for resurrections purpose.
 Yeah, and I love it.
 It's so good where can people find out more about you guys you guys are on instagram twitter your websites talk about that what if people want to find you follow you see what you look like.

  </li><li>Oh, I do.
  </li><li>Oh, I do.
 I do, but you actually helped me build.
 Thank you very much. - Oh, it's a beautiful website.
  </li><li>Yes, you can see all of my artwork at parsonstudio.com.
 dot com.
 Yes.
 Come or net?
 I think it's net.
 Oh, no.
 I'll put a link in the show notes.
 You think I should know that people can go have a look at her artwork is stunning.
 If you haven't seen it, it's remarkable.
 We have one in our front lobby as you come in her house.
 It's one of our prized possessions.
 All right, let's wrap this up.
 We are coming to the end of our window for you to apply for the School of Supernatural
 Life.
 If you go to schoolsupernaturallife.org, you can find that information about the grace
 in our school is an incredible eight month opportunity. You heard Josh and Sarah talk
 about doing that. They've done the school, they staff to school. Last question for you
 guys, what would you say people coming to the school would get in a sentence?
 I think the number one thing that people can expect to get from the school is eight months
 to completely devote their time and resources to the Lord and growing closer to him and
 just blowing their expectations out of the water of what he is capable of speaking to them about.
 I would say acceleration. I've seen just huge things that would take maybe others five years to
 achieve when you set aside eight months to go deeper with the Lord in all areas spiritually
 and practically. There's just been tremendous acceleration on the students and all in our alumni.
 All right. Well, we're done. If you would like to show notes for this episode, go to
 Alan and AJ.com/55 for the 55th episode. If you would like to ask us a question that we can answer
 on air, head over to Alan and AJ.com/ask and we'll do our best to answer your questions.
 Our great thanks to the wonderful Josh and Sarah Parsons. Thank you for giving up your
 evening to come and share your story. We love you guys and to our listeners. Thank you for
 tuning in once again. We will see you next week. See you next week. Buh-bye.
