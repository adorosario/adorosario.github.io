<p> a.j. Jones.<br/>
 Well,<br/>
 so Jones,<br/>
 you will have your jingle.<br/>
 One way or another.<br/>
 I really wanted jingle.<br/>
 I'm not going to joke about my jingle.
 My jam.<br/>
 You're somewhat scaring me.<br/>
 Let's talk about this week.<br/>
 OK, it was a highly relational week.<br/>
 It was.<br/>
 We just hung out with lots and lots of people.
 We did.<br/>
 We did.<br/>
 We did.<br/>
 You're not sure it took me a moment. Well, we had quin staying with us. We did have the mighty quin, but now he's gone. Yes, but we did get
 next for night with him because United Airlines screwed up his flights, which was very nice, but I was kind of hoping that somehow we could lock him in a closet and keep him.
 That's that was my full intent. But apparently that's against the law. Yes, well, and he's rather large to keep locked in a closet.
 But you know what the type of food that he eats would make it really, really easy to slip all that food underneath the door.
 That's true.<br/>
 Because a man does not eat vegetables.
 No.<br/>
 And he could roll out a hamburger easily, make it super thin.
 OK, we should try that later.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 Let's lure him back over here.<br/>
 We'll put on another conference and then we're keeping our coin.
 I hope he doesn't listen to our podcast.
 Well, there's the downfall.<br/>
 Um, our kids are out for summer.<br/>
 They are and they were so excited.<br/>
 They were.<br/>
 I'm slightly terrified.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Because it means we have to think about what to do with them.
 Yes, I was reading an email that Aline sent today with 70 things you can do around Nashville with kids.
 Most of them I don't think you're going to enjoy.
 I'm going to say a lot of them are outdoors.
 Are any of the 70 that you don't need parents?
 No, yeah, right. Well, kids, drive yourself in the leaf. It's a relatively small car.
 You should be able to reach the petals, Abby.
 The thing is we have jobs to go to, so how are we going to get those 70 things done?
 Well, on our off days really. Right. Yes. Speaking of our off days and children and great outdoors,
 we went for our annual walk outside. It's not our annual walk. We want to be going for walks
 more often so that our children are not the only children that are walking that are complaining
 about their legs hurting. Well, to be fair, we did do a hike for three miles.
 Yes. And they're not using it. Wait, you're not refuting that it's a hike?
 Well, it's not really a hike, but it's sort of hikish.
 How is it hikish?<br/>
 Well, it is a walk around Radner Lake.
 Half of it is slightly hilly.<br/>
 There's on the one side on the path, there's little tiny hills that for little tiny legs
 would might be termed a hike, definitely not for us.
 What I like about it is it's mostly in the shade.
 So even those outdoors, well, you don't have any cell phones like, well, that's the problem.
 probably the good thing about it in terms of the children feeling like we went for a hike with them.
 I'm going to park our car at the end like halfway so we can walk around and then jump in a car
 and drive back to the last part because the last part is super boring. But you have to get out
 of your car at the beginning. So you have to walk back to where your car is either way.
 Nice try though. I'm going to park my car and I'm going to wait in the cooler condition.
 Nice try. No. Just think of all the animals we got to see.
 i don't care about no there was an owl don't care there's a frog that we couldn't see what we did here
 there was a black snake of some sort that t is a daddy kill it kill it kill it
 i'm like get away from it get away from it i said i'd bite its head off with my teeth and then she
 was remarkably disappointed i didn't actually follow through on that and then you said well
 it wasn't really threatening you so i decided to let it live yeah and we saw a deer didn't we
 This is fascinating. Please continue up close. Well, MJ was convinced it was a cow, but then I
 think most things are cow to him, including his black bear that he sleeps with, which he calls cow.
 You know the highlight of my week was what? Mario Party 10. Really? Because it's kind of like
 the board games you wish I would play, but in video game format, I can play with the kids.
 And it's a sufficient pace that I can do other things while the kids are playing.
 Yes, and they feel like you've just played with them for the last hour some game.
 And it's incredibly engaging.<br/>
 It's not.<br/>
 I think the words incredibly engaging are stretch, but okay.
 You only played once with me and to be fair, you didn't really get into the swing of things.
 That's because you played the big demonic guy who comes and stomps on the car.
 Bowser is not demonic.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 No, he's really friendly.<br/>
 I'm trying to think of a witty comeback and I have none.
 MJ thinks that he is a dinosaur, an angry dinosaur.
 So he kind of is. Anyway, Mario Party 10, not a video game per se, but is.
 Okay.<br/>
 Spokey Church this morning.<br/>
 You did and it was awesome.<br/>
 Say that again, but louder.<br/>
 It was awesome.<br/>
 I actually mean louder. I spoke twice as a, I spoke at M&amp;A and it was the first time I've done so
 without a key note presentation i just say presentation presentation presentation or presentation either one in years yeah in a long time i don't actually remember speaking without a key note presentation.
 Okay i far prefer speaking with one i just ran out of time yeah i was crazy it was crazy and i spoke this morning absolutely with a presentation and i hope you noticed anybody who watched i up to my key note game.
 Your slides were amazing is that like a new program or something no just.
 Well kind of there's a few programs i'm using on the iPhone.
 The generate text really really beautifully and then i animate it in keynote.
 Okay i think you need to give a course on how to do this kind of stuff i do on our school you give one class on how to use keynote.
 Oh you want like an advanced nerdy yeah advanced nerdy on the topic.
 off school that's actually our main topic for this week. Oh good. I wanted to talk about the
 opportunities that we can have in life to take some time out to go get some training and equipping.
 One of my favorite quotes is Winston Churchill. He said the most important thing about education
 is appetite. And I just, you know, throughout my life, I have found that if you can carve out
 space in the midst of your daily responsibilities to feed yourself via podcasts or books or sermons
 or articles or whatever, there's an incredible joy in learning new things.
 Yeah. It's the only way you grow.<br/>
 I don't know who said this, but I saw David Campbell quote it on Twitter. He said,
 "If we're going to give ourselves to lifelong learning, then we must give ourselves to lifelong
 unlearning, which I thought was absolutely brilliant.
 Oh, yeah, that is really clever.<br/>
 Now, tell me about your schools.<br/>
 You went to YWAM.<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 How old were you and what was it like?
 Ah, goodness.<br/>
 How old was I?<br/>
 I guess I was about 22 and it was great.
 It was a five month school.<br/>
 I think it's like four months of classroom, community living
 scenario and six weeks of outreach.<br/>
 And where did you go to outreach?<br/>
 We went to Honduras for four weeks, I think.
 And then we were in Atlanta for two weeks
 during the storm of the century.<br/>
 Wow.<br/>
 And did you pay extra for the storm or that was just the bonus?
 We didn't have to pay extra.<br/>
 It was just the bonuses.<br/>
 Sure genius.<br/>
 Being freezing in Atlanta.<br/>
 What did you say were your biggest take away from being on school?
 I think anytime you do a school and you just give over a period of time to the Lord and
 say, "This is your time.<br/>
 I want to come out differently."<br/>
 You do.<br/>
 And so for me, there was lots of breakthrough in regards to fear and just different ways
 I made decisions and different ways I viewed both God and other people and what he could
 do with my life.<br/>
 So YWAM set me up perfectly for coming back and the renewal started when we were on our
 last week about Rachel, last two weeks about Rachel's something.
 It was awesome because I think if I hadn't done YWAM, my heart wouldn't have been open
 to.<br/>
 God can move in a way that you don't understand and it's still okay.
 Why?<br/>
 What was it that he did at YWAM that was new to you that would have not been okay?
 Had you not been in YWAM?<br/>
 I think, I think because I didn't grow up in the church.
 I got a lot of the basics at YM that I really didn't realize I didn't have.
 So even just stuff like prayer and, you know, how to pray and spiritual authority and all
 that kind of stuff.<br/>
 I didn't, I didn't really know that.<br/>
 And if you're just getting your information and bits and starts on Sunday mornings, I,
 I, I, I didn't realize how big the holes were.
 Right.<br/>
 And what I was missing.<br/>
 And so, but I remember in our last week at YWAM, and they didn't really teach on prophecy
 or any of the supernatural type stuff that we teach on our school.
 But at one point, we were praying and interceding over the nations, and I ended up singing prophetically
 for 40 minutes.<br/>
 And I'd never, ever done that.<br/>
 I'd never seen it done.<br/>
 I had almost no idea what was going on.
 It was almost like I was outside of myself watching myself do this thing and they recorded
 it and whatever.<br/>
 I remember afterwards I processed it for weeks like, "Lord, what was that?"
 How did that happen?<br/>
 It wasn't until all that incident happened that I started hearing a Lord a different
 way.<br/>
 That was when the prophetic started opening up to me was just after that.
 So the prophetic moving in the prophetic wasn't a thing until after that encounter.
 No, it wasn't a thing at all until after that encounter yet.
 Wow.<br/>
 Mm-hmm.<br/>
 I remember on YWAM there was one of our friends, one of my friends Scott, he and his wife
 had come over from the UK for YWAM.<br/>
 And he was quite prophetic and would get stuff for people and go and give them stuff.
 And I remember just sort of marveling at that, like thinking, gosh, how does he know what
 God's saying?<br/>
 So I know that I didn't hear God before that moment.
 And I don't remember praying to hear him.
 It's just, I think you spend five months or however many months on your school learning
 to be open to God and God goes, okay.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 So yeah, it was transformational for me.
 See, I'd say the same thing for me in coming to Toronto.
 Like I wanted to do the school in Toronto for so many years and I'd encounter the graduate
 who'd done the school and they all had something about them that I didn't have, I couldn't quantify
 what that was. But they all had this shared experience of going through and without any
 exaggeration being on school in Toronto for five months completely changed my life.
 And I would say I knew probably 20% of the teaching. I had a working knowledge of 20%
 of the teaching and the rest of it was revelation. And I remember some of the weeks going,
 this is so outside of my comfort zone. I'm not even sure I agree with this. And the Holy Spirit
 would say, Alan, you've paid all this money to be here. Why don't you listen to it and process it
 later? Because of the danger that if you're trying to, you know, if you're so occupied processing
 what you think is right or wrong without understanding the sum of the teaching that's trying to be
 given to you, you'll miss out on what God's trying to teach you. And I just think about the,
 the teaching that I got, well, you did our Father Heart Week.
 That was crazy.<br/>
 So could we?<br/>
 And then Ivan and Isabelle, Alum coming in and teaching on the prophetic.
 Oh, they're amazing.<br/>
 I mean, they are amazing.<br/>
 I mean, but I already knew how to prophesy, but they, I would say, I knew how, if, you
 know, if you're going to use an algae, I knew how to sketch with a paper and pencil.
 Right.<br/>
 They taught you, you know, watercolor, oil, sculpting, I mean, they just kind of blew
 up your frame of reference for, you know, the prophetic.
 And then everything else.<br/>
 And I also think, I was thinking about this earlier as we were preparing to record this
 about how you don't just come to the school for teaching.
 You come for the community and you come for the connections and you come for the experience.
 Yeah, the experience.<br/>
 And so sometimes people ask us, "Hey, would you make your school available online?"
 And I'm kind of wary of that because I'm thinking it isn't the teaching that changes you.
 Right.<br/>
 It's the whole package.<br/>
 Yeah, it really is.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And I think online you'd miss so much of the heart stuff like, yeah, we could get your
 head stuff.<br/>
 You know, you can get all that teaching and stuff, but it's the laying out of hands of
 all the different speakers.<br/>
 It's all the different moments where God just shows up and sort of moves all the head stuff
 to heart stuff.<br/>
 You know, talking about the school changing my life, I ended up marrying one of the teachers.
 You did, yes.<br/>
 Mm hmm.<br/>
 You know, I'm to this day still very, very good friends with the directors of the school.
 Yes.<br/>
 I moved in with the senior pastors of the church that ran the school.
 Now, I don't think we can expect everybody who goes in the school to have that scenario,
 but yes.<br/>
 No, no, that's true, but everybody has their own experience of what happens on school.
 Yeah.<br/>
 So those people I was on school with who are now on staff at that church.
 You know, so, you know, of course not everybody who goes there, but everybody who goes there
 will have their own experience of what God wants to do.
 Right.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 Totally.<br/>
 I always think it's interesting, babe, when we sometimes hear feedback from people like
 we'll say, "Hey, you know, are you into the school or we're talking to somebody?"
 And we'll hear feedback.<br/>
 Usually people don't tell us this to our face, but they'll tell their friends, "Well, I've
 been at Eminate for four years or I've been at the church for X many years and I've already
 heard all this stuff."<br/>
 And to me, that's so funny because the whole reason
 we started this school is we can't possibly download
 into you the fullness of each of those teachings
 and just emanate or just Sunday morning.
 So the whole reason we made this school
 is because we don't just want to teach one or two sermons
 on a topic, but we actually want to immerse you
 in it for a week until you live it<br/>
 and then get the next thing.<br/>
 I was at the church in Toronto for 20 years,
 but I'd still go and do the schools.<br/>
 Like I went and did the leader school,
 even though, I mean, by the time I did the leader school,
 I'd been there for, well, let me think I did it in 2002.
 So I'd been there for already 10 years.
</p><ul>
  <li>Right.
  </li><li>And I, you know, pretty much never missed a service, you know?
 So yeah, I heard a lot, but I still got so much out
 of that school, 'cause there's something about, again,
 setting the time aside and being able to sit under a teaching for, you know, let it,
 let it layer on top of each other and let it really get in deep.
 Right.
 I think, you know, back to what you said of, I've heard this already.
 The two thoughts on that one is like I taught this morning on, you know, living
 out of what we believe that was one session.
 We'd probably do a week on all of that plus all the supplementary weeks about
 identity.
 Yeah.
 And so that's just, you'd work it through in small group.
 Yes, you'd have exercises.
 Yeah.
 And so that's just art, you know, the staff teaching.
 But then we also have speakers from around the world coming and teach.
 And, you know, even if you come one Sunday and I don't know,
 Artie Kendall is speaking for one session.
 That's completely different from having Artie Kendall for six sessions.
 Right.
 So, you know, I, I do think there's something about setting aside time
 that the Lord really honors.
 When you diligently set aside time, just say, Lord, I'm actually
 humbling myself to learn, would you teach me? There's something amazing that happens.
 And I can testify to that first time being a student, but also testify as somebody who's
 watched people be transformed in the last four years of running our school. Can you
 believe we're about to start our fifth year of the school?
 I really can't believe it. It's amazing to me.
 What are some of your favorite things about running a school?
 I think I love getting to know the students, like getting to watch them transform over
 eight months getting to watch them really grasp how love they are and how called they
 are and all that.
 You know what I mean?
 Like seeing the transformation is fantastic.
 Right.
 It's just amazing.
 Hearing their testimonies, you know, every week about the different things that God's
 doing.
 I just, if there's, yeah, if there's one thing I don't want to miss on the weeks that I'm
 not teaching, it's the testimonies to hear what, what did God do this week?
 because you're not doing school in a bubble.
 You're still going to work.
 You're still interacting with people around you.
 You're still going to the grocery store.
 You're still maybe seeing your family,
 all that kind of stuff.
 So you get to walk it out now instead of being in a bubble
 and then returning home and seeing if you can walk it out.
 So yeah, I love that.
 And I love teaching.
 I just really enjoy teaching.
 Me too.
 I actually miss the students on the weeks
 that we're not teaching.
 So do I.
 I mean, I love that they're getting incredible teaching from, you know, the other staff and
 our visiting speakers, but I absolutely miss being in there and being able to be with them.
 And yeah, it's a huge privilege, isn't it, to be invited into lives of people to share?
 Yeah, it's amazing.
 You talk a little bit about the whole bubble effect.
 And can you talk a little bit about the intentionality of the way we designed our school?
 You know, we looked at a whole bunch of different schools and there's lots of amazing schools
 out there.
 So we were like, wow, okay, what do we want ours to look like?
 And it seemed to me that the challenge in doing this kind of school where it's not residential,
 where they're going to have to still be able to pay rent and buy food and all that kind
 of stuff is you have to have a way for people to keep their jobs or find, you know, have
 enough time to work and also be able to do school.
 Right.
 And so we've seen a couple of different examples of that.
 Some schools do, you know, part of each day or whatever.
 I used to work in restaurants and stuff like that.
 And I remember it just being a better scenario if you could say, these are the four days
 I can work rather than, you know, I can work this day in the morning and this day at night
 and you know that kind of stuff.
 So we decided to do Sunday, Monday, Tuesday because Sunday is just being part of a normal
 church body and it's where you get a lot of your service opportunities and that kind of
 thing.
 And then school all day Monday and Tuesday means you can still work Wednesday, Thursday,
 Friday, Saturday.
 Wow.
 So for most jobs, I mean, we didn't really realize even how well it was going to work
 out.
 Like we've even had business people like that have really high level jobs that their jobs
 have let them do their timing.
 However, they want to do it as long as they're getting their job done and they were able
 to come and do this whole Monday and Tuesday because it's not every day of the week for
 a little bit, you know, so you do have the rest of the week to make it work.
 So that was sort of the intentionality of that, to make it easier to be able to have a job,
 pay your bills, and do the school.
 Right, and talk about small groups.
 Well, you meet every Tuesday in small groups, and there are obviously gender-specific groups,
 so women with women, men with men.
 And you just talk about the week, and you process together, and you pray for each other, and
 sometimes they go out together, but they just, you know, they have time together, walking
 this out in a smaller group than the larger group that is the school. So they tend to
 form some pretty amazing friendships and stuff like that. But it's walking through a life
 transformational time together with a smaller group of people that are supporting you.
 That's amazing. What I love is there are schools all over the world that people can
 do. Yeah, there really are.
 We encourage those who come to saying, "Hey, I'm thinking about doing this school," to
 go do it because it's an incredible investment into your inheritance with God.
 And there's some excellent schools out there. The school that I went in Toronto is now all
 over the world. The Ketchup Fire School, they've got them, I'll put a link in the show notes,
 they've got schools everywhere. You've got the school in Reading, Bethel School of Supernatural
 Ministry. You've got Edinburgh School of Supernatural Transformation. All these different schools
 you've got YWAM everywhere and all these different schools with different flavors, different approaches
 to learning. I would just encourage you to pray about an opportunity for you to do a
 school that fits in with your life or maybe you change your life to do the school. We
 would certainly love to have you here. We have a family from Australia who are moving
 to come to school, which is just so exciting. We need really good accents on the school.
 That's what we're missing. Yeah. It brings like the cultural factor.
 in all seriousness. That's what I loved about our school in Toronto. You had all the nations
 there. Amazing.
 All right. Ready for some listeners questions? Yes. Okay. This one is from Nicole. Hi, Nicole.
 She says, "I wish I would have thought of this question a week or two earlier, but as I sat
 through the more conference, which was amazing, I started thinking about how I could have
 better prepared my spirit and my mind to receive. Then I started thinking about what it means
 to live life after a conference. So I think it would be amazing to hear a
 conferencing how to from some of the pros. What is the best way to open my heart to
 receive and how do I apply the things that happen in our hearts during a
 conference so we're not living conference to conference but rejoicing
 what God is doing in our hearts daily. That is an amazing question Nicole. Very
 wise of you to ask. And here was a brilliant answer is H.A. Jones. No
 No pressure, no pressure.
 I remember us going into this conference.
 And I mean, for us, it was great
 because we didn't have to minister at the conference.
 We just got to receive.
 But I remember on Friday, Allen and I stopping
 and praying and just saying,
 Lord, we want everything you have for us, this conference.
 Please give us open ears, open hearts,
 help us to not analyze.
 We can analyze later 'cause we both tend
 to be fairly analytical.
 So help us to sort of unseat the analytical side of it
 so that we can receive what you have for us.
 And you can always go back and analyze later.
 I don't ever want to encourage anybody to unseat their brain
 because God gave you a brain
 and you need to be able to check things out against scripture
 and all that kind of stuff.
 But I think sometimes we can get so locked into,
 this is actually different than anything I've ever heard before
 that we can no longer hear it
 because we want to filter it.
 We want to make everything match up.
 And sometimes we need to hear it
 so that we can process it to figure out
 if it needs to match up.
 And I think typically, like if you go into a conference
 with your heart open to hear
 and your spiritual ears open to hear
 and your mind open to hear,
 the Lord tends to build a platform
 that you can head forward on that level now
 after the conference is over, you know?
 So I think the key in not losing it
 is to return to what God just opened up
 and process it with him and ask him
 to help you make a part of your life.
 Okay, God, this was new for me.
 I didn't realize that you viewed me like this.
 Would you help me walk out in that revelation
 and not take steps backwards?
 And God's great at doing that.
 He's great at setting off an alarm.
 That's sort of how I explain when God sort of goes,
 Hey, hey, hey, we're not going there anymore.
 Do you remember?
 That's one of the things I ask you to do.
 Lord, set off an alarm when I do this
 or when I think this or when I'm partnering with that.
 Or if I'm stepping backwards,
 would you set off an alarm?
 And the Lord is so good to sort of tap you on the shoulder
 or tap you on the heart and go,
 hey, remember how we weren't gonna think that anymore?
 Hey, remember how, you know, right?
 Okay, good, yeah.
 God help me to hold on to what you did.
 And I'm still really processing a lot of stuff
 at Graham said at the more conference.
 I need to listen to the MP3s and just sort of go over them.
 But I'm really glad that we prayed that prayer going in
 because I really could have just gone in functional
 with the attitude of, yeah, prove it.
 And I didn't, which is great.
  </li><li>I also think, I didn't agree with everything
 you just said, babe.
 But I'd also encourage you to get with people
 who were at the conference and share what was important to you
 and also get with people who weren't at the conference,
 who are hungry because expression reinforces impression.
 The process of you sharing what God was doing
 actually helps you process what God was doing
 and actually reinforces what God was doing.
 And that's a very, very important thing.
 And I can't recommend highly enough getting
 the recordings of the conference
 because there is no way you're gonna remember
 everything that was said.
 You basically have an attention span of about 20 minutes.
 most conference sessions are about an hour if not longer.
 There's no way you can retain all that information.
 So listening to it, reprocessing,
 and spending time with the Lord in it is super important.
 And then I think applying what you heard.
 The parable of the sower has been just running around my head
 the last couple of weeks because I want to be one of the people
 who gets a harvest and I'm not content with 30 or 60,
 I want 100 fold.
 So I don't want the care of the world or the enemy
 to come and steal the thoughts that God's planted in me.
 So that's what I think about those things.
 Any other thoughts on conferences?
  </li><li>I just think you don't want a conference
 to be the only place where you're getting fed.
 You need to be feeding yourself at home,
 you need to be going, you know, go to church every week,
 get fed there, be part of a small group of ones available.
 You know, like have different places
 where you connect with God and connect with others
 and get filled and get encouraged.
 Don't just live conference to conference.
 again, experience is awesome.
 God wants us to experience him,
 but he also wants to experience us face-to-face
 every single day, you know?
 So stay in touch with God.
 Let him keep working on your life.
 And then conferences are like your boost forward
 instead of your lifeline, 'cause you're dying.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Right, let's wrap up.

 Have a great week.
 Hey, my name is Judo Lake and I am 25 years old and I have just completed my first year
 at the school of supernatural life here at Grace Center.
 Currently, I'm living in more freedom
 than I have ever experienced in my entire life.
 Freedom that I didn't even know was possible.
 School is amazing, hard to describe in words.
 Very, very focused on the heart,
 because the Bible says the heart is the wellspring of life.
 Until you get that in alignment, for me,
 everything else is just kind of head knowledge
 and information that might puff you up spiritually,
 that it really isn't transforming your life.
  </li><li>People would constantly tell me about the school
 they would always tell me about,
 "Oh, you'll know your destiny, you'll know your destiny."
 And to be honest, that kind of rubbed me
 the wrong way for a while.
 But now I realize what they meant.
 You can't really put it into words,
 but it's not that you're going after your destiny,
 is that the school points you to going after
 the heart of the Father and after Christ.
 And through that, just that the byproduct of that
 is finding out who he's called you to
 and what your identity is in him.
 That was the biggest thing for me that I realized,
 is that the focus is not on my destiny.
 The focus is unpriced, but he's focused on me.
  </li><li>The best way that I would describe the school
 is like P90X for your spirit.
 It's not four years of seminary.
 You're not having to sign away the rest of your life
 for a couple years, but it's literally eight months,
 two days a week.
 So it's this intense P90X for the spirit
 where it really kind of goes for the jugular
 in the most healthy sense of the word.
 My life has been completely turned upside down and inside out.
 I now have an understanding of who I am as a son.
 I have a father who loves me unconditionally.
 That I am worthy of honor.
 That I'm worthy of love.
 Every aspect of my life has been changed.
  </li><li>I was thinking I would go to this school
 so I could get all the answers to life
 and figure out like the what ifs
 and like what I'm gonna do in my life
 and how I'm gonna change the world.
 but it actually did something way better
 and it introduced me to the person
 who actually knows all the answers.
 So the school helped me cultivate
 a personal relationship with Father God,
 which is more than anything I could ever ask.
  </li><li>I came to school super natural life.
 It allowed me to take the theory in Bible,
 the spiritual and the practical,
 and join them all together,
 which in turn has allowed me to grow in places
 and to do things that I never thought
 that I would be able to do.
  </li><li>What was really cool about the school
 is that you have small groups. Everyone is just champions each other. Like they
 support you and you know they tell you what they love about you and how you're
 being brave even though I didn't feel brave or how you're being vulnerable
 even though I didn't feel vulnerable and so that was really awesome for me and
 also just with our small groups just being able to be personal and I think a
 lot of my walls have gone down. I'm able more to receive love.
 I've always been to different places and learn different things about the Bible and how to study and read.
 But I never had the safe environment in order to practice the things that I was learning.
 It really released me and gave me the confidence that I need to step out and do the things that I believe the Lord has called me to do.
 I've grown up in church my whole life. Really just church was all just because I should because the Bible tells me so and you know all that stuff.
 And I was never really out of love.
 And throughout this year, learning that he wants to talk to me,
 and that he genuinely loves me and desires
 relationship with me personally, just changed it all
 from where ministry standpoint is.
 It's like, I get to minister because I'm a daughter.
 And that he loves me so much.
 And I just want to share this love so everyone else can experience it.
 My first exposure to the school was about two years ago.
 One of my best friends went through the school.
 And I saw such a dramatic change in his life
 that I thought, man, I kind of need that in my life.
 Like, I know I'm okay, like I love the Lord.
 I'm in a career.
 I think I'm great, but what if God could do in my life
 what He just did in my friend's life?
  </li><li>It's given us tools that set us up for success
 because we're aware of so many things,
 internal dynamics that operate in relationships,
 any relationship, really.
  </li><li>Understanding each other more,
 accepting each other how we're different because we really are different.
 I fully recommend anybody that is even thinking about doing the school. If you just have an
 inkling of a desire, maybe just ask him, "Okay, I don't think I can do it, but if you want me to
 do it, then you need to make it happen and trust me, he will do it."
 It's really been one of the most incredible experiences I have ever made the choice to do
 and kind of partner with God. It's been so rewarding and my life has changed as a result of doing
 the school of supernatural life and it's hands down one of the best decisions I ever could have made
 for myself. Literally everything is different, everything is changed. I would highly encourage
 anybody to do the school. If they want a radical encounter with the Father, if they want a deeper
 understanding of the love that he has for us, if they want to know who the Holy Spirit is,
 I would encourage you to do this school.
 Because not only does it introduce you to you, the supernatural, but it introduces you to
 a lifelong relationship with a father who loves us relentlessly.
 I'm so thankful.
