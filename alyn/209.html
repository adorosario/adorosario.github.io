<p> Island and AJ's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Welcome to episode 209 of Keeping Up With Joneses where it's a
 drink day in Franklin, Tennessee.<br/>
 -Dreak. -Dreak.<br/>
 That's Scottish for blah.<br/>
 That's Scottish for normal weather.<br/>
 [laughs]<br/>
 But like, dreak is like rainy, sludgy.
 -Yeah. -Rae.<br/>
 As I look outside our studio windows today,
 it's, there's no leaves in the tree.<br/>
 It's a watercolor gray sky.<br/>
 Everything is damp and it's been drizzling all day.
 It is the textbook definition of dreak.
</p><ul>
  <li>I know, but in Raleigh, they got like 10 inches of snow.
  </li><li>Did my sister get 10 inches of snow?
  </li><li>I don't know what she got.
 Well, she's not in Raleigh, she's in Charlotte,
 but Raleigh, like I'm looking on Instagram
 and it looks like, it looks like Canada.
 I was like, has everybody gone to Canada?
  </li><li>Oh, 'cause the two people I follow there
 have lived in Canada, so I thought they were
 traveling at the same time.
 No, they just got snow.
  </li><li>Yeah, so well, maybe drink here,
 but at least we don't have snow.
 Is that what you're saying?
  </li><li>Yes, although I think I'd rather have snow than drink.
 I don't know, just thought.
  </li><li>Well, that's a weather update.
 (laughs)
 This week we're talking about physical healing,
 but before we get to that,
 Eddie Jones High was our week.
  </li><li>We had a really good week.
 It was a full week, lots of Christmas parties and such.
  </li><li>You're only saying we had a good week
 because you got a new llama.
 It's back from the grave.
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; The llama up from the grave, it arose &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 Yes, I have another llama balloon
 that looks exactly like the last one that you murdered.
  </li><li>Which again, freaked me out this morning.
 (laughing)
 Why was it in the kitchen?
  </li><li>I know, and I slept on the sofa last night
 so that you could sleep because my snoring
 and my congestion's been so bad.
 And so at 6 a.m. when I woke up, bleary-eyed,
 not remembering it was in the kitchen I walked in
 and the silhouette of this thing looming over me.
 So I stabbed it.
  </li><li>You did not, it's still there.
  </li><li>It's not there.
  </li><li>Where is it?
  </li><li>It's for me to know.
  </li><li>Where did you move my llama to?
  </li><li>You get to practice your prophetic gift
 and you can find it, but the llama lives.
 You're right, we had lots of Christmas parties.
  </li><li>Alan Jones, that llama came here from Ireland.
 It was ordered from Ireland.
  </li><li>Money well spent.
 We did, we had lots of Christmas parties this week.
 Well, I said lots with two for a highly introverted person.
 That's certainly a lot.
 Hey, they were back to back.
 They were.
 You know, that's pretty intense.
 Our kids were like, do we have babysitters again?
 We're like, yes, honey.
 Or you will see your parents at some point a promise.
 It's a good thing they love their sitters though.
 So really good thing.
 Yeah.
 Just as well.
 Ask me if I'm an electrical engineer.
 Are you an electrical engineer?
 No, but you'd be forgiven for thinking so
 because I did fix the sauna.
 You--
 Yes, you did.
 So last week I talked about that.
 However.
 Last week, I explained that I attempted to fix our sauna by rewiring it, but when I plugged
 it in, it blew a lot of the electrics, which were on the same circuit.
 Yes.
 So you might be wondering to yourself, how did you fix the sauna, Alan?
 How did you fix the sauna, Alan?
 It's interesting to know I had to bring in my electrician friend, Neil, who...
 Yes.
 Sweet Neil, who fixes all of our electrical issues.
 Where would we be without Neil?
 Well, we'd be in the dark in many ways.
 He basically pointed out that I need a separate circuit to run that thing on that sauna is pretty power heavy
 So we were running on a 15 amp circuit and so we were overloading it
 So he very kindly installed a brand new circuit a 20 amp circuit the only scary part
 Well, there's many scary parts electricity scares me
 But one of the scariest parts was there was no room on our breaker panel indoors
 So we had to use the main panel on the outside of the house. Yeah, and it was raining
 and it was in the dark and Neil was convinced we didn't need to shut off the electricity.
 So he's doing everything live with wet hands standing on wet grass.
 I'm like, "Should I just dial 9-1 and then wait to dial another one?"
 Things go perishable.
 But they did not go perishable.
 So you installed a brand new 20-amp circuit.
 He is a clever man, is our Neil?
 He is.
 Plugged in the sauna and he pressed it works.
 Yeah, and now it gets really hot.
 But my point is it works because...
 -Because you fixed the panels. -That's all I wanted to do.
 -Because Neil put in the right thing.
 -Yes. -Yes.
 -There are two completely separate issues. I leave indicated.
 -Okay. Good.
 -Your books arrived today?
 -Yesterday, yeah. -Oh, yeah.
 -Or maybe two days ago. Anyway, they arrived.
 -It's all a blur. -It is.
 It's all sort of... It's becoming December.
 You know, in December, when one day blurs into the next,
 all in a march towards the 25th,
 "Well, my mind is screaming, I'm not ready. I'm not ready."
 I'm not ready. Too late. There you go. Now you have that little view into my heart.
 We're recording this Sunday afternoon because you have the women's Christmas
 party evening extravaganza. I don't know what it's called. It's a women's evening,
 but we just go home from church. Yes, true.
 So we have a very short window of time to talk about something really important.
 It's funny that we're talking about physical healing because I didn't know
 anything about it for most of my Christian life. Yeah.
 Well, I would imagine a lot of people don't.
 Yeah, we just, I mean, you think about healing
 as something a doctor does,
 not necessarily something that God does.
  </li><li>And yet the Greek word that's used for saved,
 the evangelicals of which I am one,
 would use all the time, the Greek word,
 there is so-so, which means saved, healed and delivered.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And again, the evangelical tradition I grew up in,
 that Greek word just meant saved, period.
 We only used that word saved, like as in your sins are forgiven.
 That's all it was.
 Yeah.
 And now that I've been in the charismatic tradition, are we even a tradition?
 I don't know.
 Now I've been in more charismatic churches for, I don't know, half my life maybe.
 Yeah.
 I'm fascinated how much I missed out on and misunderstood.
 I was thinking earlier about Jesus, I think it's in Luke five where he says, he's with
 a paralytic and he's being questioned, I think by the Pharisees of my memory, search me correct.
 And he says, which is easier to say your sins are forgiven or rise up and walk.
 Right.
 And Jesus is his point is I have the power to do the same thing.
 I have the power to so's you have the power to save, I have the power to heal, right, which one's easier, right?
 And I never saw anyone get healed growing up.
 me neither. So I had no theology for healing because I guess I didn't have to.
 Right. So my answer to Jesus's question would be much harder to say rise up and walk.
 Right. Easy. Have your sins forgiven. Just pray this little prayer and you can come to Jesus.
 You can invite him to your heart. Done. And yet Jesus demonstrates, you know, rise up and walk,
 yeah, pick up, carry her mat and go. And that's exactly what happened.
 I hadn't really thought about that, babe, because I think, I mean, while I didn't certainly go to
 church anywhere near as much as you did as a child, my sporadic engagement with a couple of different
 kinds of denominations. We had no expectation of healing, basically. I mean, we would sort of
 throw a prayer that way, but it was like no expectation that God actually did still heal.
 Which is sad because that's what Jesus paid for. Yeah, it's super sad.
 And I think that's a bit that I'm angri-stew strong word, but most
 sad about is that the right emphasis on Jesus' death on the cross purchasing the forgiveness
 of our sins seemed to have come at the expense of preaching about Jesus' purchasing or healing
 on the cross. And it was only in later Christian life that I actually learned that, and I still
 even hotly debated, even by people who practice healing. But before we even get into that,
 I'm staying back when I was like a child.
 I knew that Jesus wanted to save.
 I didn't think Jesus wanted to heal because nobody even talked about it.
 Not like anybody said, hey, do you believe Jesus still heals today?
 That wasn't even a discussion.
 Wasn't a discussion because it wasn't visible.
 And I think if anybody had mentioned about Jesus healing somebody like this
 morning, Jeff just told the story of somebody who'd got healed of Crohn's
 disease.
 I think probably back then I would have just written that off as either foolish
 people being deceived or maybe some faith-healing scam, something like that.
 Or they must not really have had Crohn's.
 They just thought they did.
 They had a sore tummy.
 Exactly.
 Yeah.
 You know, they took some Advil and forgot about it.
 The sad part of that is what we do today, representing Jesus's ministry,
 doesn't look really like what Jesus's ministry actually was.
 Right.
 If you take the example, Dr. Luke wrote in Acts 10, verse 38, he says,
 "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit in power,
 and Jesus went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil
 because God was with him."
 Yes.
 And if you read the Gospels, you see the fullness of salvation in the life of Jesus.
 You see Jesus healing people.
 You see Jesus doing deliverance and freeing people from the torment of demonic spirits.
 and you see him preaching the gospel and seeing people saved,
 literally healing everyone who was under the power of the devil.
 And yet in my experience, we only did a third of those things.
 Right, for sure.
 We preached the gospel.
 Yeah, I was just thinking about my grandma who was Anglican.
 You know, I never, I didn't really hear about healing
 going to the Anglican church,
 But I remember she belonged to something called
 the Order of St. Luke, which is basically a bunch of
 accents, I believe that God was still healing today.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>And I remember saying to her,
 "Grandma, have you seen anybody healed?"
 And she said, "Not yet, but I'm going to."
 Like she was just, she was like,
 I remember her pointing to her Bible and saying,
 "It's in here, it's in here."
 Like, you know, and I thought,
 "Oh, that's interesting."
 But I didn't think about that until you were just talking
 about, you know, that's fairly unusual for her
 to have grasped a hold of that.
 I've realized now that so much time is wasted
 in debate regarding healing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I think you just need to be around people
 who are practicing it and most of your questions go away.
  </li><li>Or people who have been healed,
 a lot of your questions might go away.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Right.
 I remember the first time I hadn't met Steve Long.
 So this wasn't what I met him.
 I didn't know him at this point.
 I was in, I lived in Edinburgh
 and Steve was a church in Glasgow.
 I drove through it's been hour away for those of you don't know your Scottish geography
 Why would you and I turn up at this church and there's worship which is great leads to worship and after worship?
 They introduced Steve long and Steve stands up and you know Steve's just super laid back. He's like hi. My name Steve
 You know, I'm from Toronto. I'm so glad to be here tonight
 I want to preach on healing but before I preach on healing
 I think it'd be good to heal somebody and that way we were learning about what we've just seen rather than just teaching
 pine the sky. So I was just wondering, I think it would probably be easiest if we find the
 most difficult person to heal, the sickest person in the room, will let Jesus heal them
 and then everything else should be easy after that.
 Oh my gosh, I love Steve.
 And I was like, wait, what's happening? Like no academic discussion, no Bible study, just
 that announcement. So we all quickly agree that the woman in the wheelchair is probably
 the sixth person in the room. And then Steve says, "Hey, if I pray for her, you're all
 going to think it's something to do with me. So who's never healed anybody before?" And
 these two ladies put up their hand and they said, "Oh, you've never healed anybody?
 He's like, great. Okay, well, let me show you what to do." And so he talks him through
 how to minister healing. And so he does. And he says to the lady, "Well, actually, the
 two ladies who are praying, as soon as they lay hands on this woman in the wheelchair,
 they start shaking and kind of like screaming.
 They start making loud noises.
 And Steve says, "Look at that, isn't that odd?
 Isn't that weird?
 I guess that's a little bit off-putting if you've never seen that before.
 Why don't we ask the person who's being prayed for if it's off-putting?"
 So Steve said, "Hey, how are you doing in the wheelchair?"
 And the lady says, "Oh, I can feel heat going through my body."
 She's like, "Oh, oh, you're feeling heat going through, but do you feel better or worse?"
 She's like, "I feel better."
 the fact that these two ladies that are kind of like making some noises at bodies, you're
 like, "No, no, no, keep it going, something's happening."
 Cut long story short, this woman gets healed and Steve, rather nonchalantly, is just like,
 "Yay, that's great.
 Okay, well, now let's turn the scriptures and see what Jesus taught about healing."
 And I was like, "I have.
 Hey, I've never seen anything like that in my life."
 Right.
 And B, I've never seen that modeled before.
 And C, now I'm really interested in what you're saying, rather than just listen to something
 academically and ready to pick holes in it.
 Right.
 Right.
 I remember John, so that was Steve Long. He was one of the pastors in Toronto.
 I lived in Scotland at that point. Then I flew over to go to Steve Church in Toronto and to attend
 a school where I met you. Then I ended up meeting the founding pastor of that church, John and Carol
 Arnett, Steve's pastor, and I ended up traveling with John and Carol. I ended up traveling with John
 John and Carol and they between John and Carol and Steve, they pretty much solidified
 and not convinced me that God was healing because I was already convinced, but they taught
 me and explained a bunch of stuff I was so confused about.
 Well, and demonstrated, isn't they?
 Oh, demonstrated out the wazoo.
 It was unbelievable.
 But I remember John saying, "Alon, the more I preach about healing, the less people get
 healed.
 The more I heal people, the more people get healed."
 So, you know, do less preaching about healing and do more healing and you'll see better results.
 I was like, that is remarkably simple.
 But yes.
 What about you?
 What was your journey into healing?
 Well, I mean, I got healed.
 So that sort of helps.
 I grew up with asthma and pretty bad asthma.
 I end up in the hospital a lot.
 Define a lot.
 A lot, like hundreds and hundreds of times.
 I would end up being kept for weeks and weeks.
 I would get pneumonia every year.
 And because my asthma was so bad,
 they keep me in the hospital for weeks.
  </li><li>And the children's hospital in Toronto knew you by name.
  </li><li>By name, I literally would walk in,
 and this is a massive hospital.
 And as soon as they saw me, they would be like,
 right this way, Allison, we'll put you in here,
 'cause they knew how fast it could go badly with me.
 And--
  </li><li>Like you literally had like 400 and something hotel,
 bracelets, hospital bracelets.
  </li><li>Hospital bracelets, yeah.
 So, I mean, I went a lot.
 And right around the time I went to YWAM,
 which I guess was, I was like 22, I think.
 My asthma was getting worse.
 It had sort of taken a turn for the worse around the time
 that I was 18 and I started going to see this specialist
 on a regular basis and so I'd go several times a month
 and they would do pulmonary function tests.
 at one point, they had said, you know, to my mom, I don't know if she lives till she's
 20. Like it seemed that I was going downhill rather quickly. And I had gotten prayer. Gosh,
 I don't even know. 30 times. I mean, so many times.
 Where are you at the moment? Are you in the Anglican church?
 No, by this time I am, I was in the Anglican church, got prayer there. And then I was with
 The Baptist for about four years got lots of prayer there
 and then ended up at the church in Toronto
 and had gotten prayer there and I had done YWAM.
 And so, I mean, everywhere I was going,
 there was people praying, but just nothing was shifting.
  </li><li>Okay, then I guess God doesn't wanna heal you.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, that's what it was.
  </li><li>Okay, I'm being facetious.
 I didn't mean to be facetious.
 But my point is we draw really bad conclusions
 from our own experiences.
  </li><li>Right, but that's because we're so disappointed
 that we just can't hope seems to hurt at that point.
 I know it was being funny there, but did you at some point ever have that thought?
 Well, I guess I've been prayed for and I haven't got healed.
 So I guess it's not God's will to heal me.
 Yeah, I did think that.
 You know, and then you hear all those other arguments like, well, God is teaching you
 something through this.
 And I'm like, yeah, I'm learning what it feels like to drown because I can't get
 air, you know, like I'm like, okay, what is your character's refined as you
 asked for air?
 Seems like seems like exactly what a loving father would do.
 Anyway, I didn't realize the faulty argument at the time.
 I was just like, oh.
 So you were believing some of those things?
 Oh, yeah.
 Because it gives you temporary comfort.
 I just, it's not my time.
 Sure.
 And it's got to teaching me something through this.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And I just thought, well, you know,
 if this is the thing that takes me home, at least I'm going home,
 you know, kind of thing.
 Like, oh my god.
 I know.
 I know.
 But like, I had almost died so many times.
 my lungs would collapse, like just crazy stuff would happen.
 That that was sort of a reality for me.
 And Lord, anyway, I was I was going away with why I'm to go on
 outreach and we were going to Honduras.
 And so I'd gone home at Christmas to just, you know, see family
 and stuff and we would fly out, I think on the 28th or 29th of December.
 And so I went to go see my specialist because I haven't seen
 them in a few months because I'd been away with why I am.
 And I just said, "Hey, we're going to Honduras.
 I don't think I can bring any syringes
 because I would have to have stuff like adrenaline with me
 in case my lungs collapsed and different stuff."
 And so I just said, "Can you, is there anything you can give me
 to help me because my machine's not going to work down there
 because I had a ventilator machine
 that I would bring with me everywhere?
 So I need something."
 And so he begged me not to go.
  </li><li>This is your specialist.
 My specialist, my doctor, he was like, I'm begging you not to go.
 He said, I don't believe that you're going to live.
 And he said, I just, you know, there'll be dust.
 There'll be all the things that set you off.
 You won't be near hospital.
 Like please don't go.
 How old are you at this point?
 Um, well, it was 93.
 So I was 22.
 And so he's known you for a number of years.
 A couple of years.
 Yeah.
 So he's been your specialist that you've been seeing.
 So he knows your history.
 And he's the one that really didn't think I was going to live much past 20.
 And so here I am at 22.
 And he's a lovely, lovely Jewish guy and just sweet.
 And so I go, I just said, you know, I'm going,
 I really feel like I'm supposed to go.
 And actually, Dark Thomas, I'm okay if I die going to do
 what I feel like God asked me to do,
 which probably wasn't the most helpful thing to say to him.
 So he actually called mom, he's ulterior,
 he called mom with me sitting at his desk and said,
 "If you let her go, she comes back in a body bag.
 "Like, don't let her go."
  </li><li>Didn't your aunt buy extra travel insurance
 to make sure your body could give one back?
  </li><li>She did.
 She bought extra insurance to have my body shipped back.
 So, you know, everybody was full of faith
 that I was gonna be okay.
 So, anyway, I went home and of course,
 then had to deal with my mom's emotions on the subject.
 And I just said, I feel like I'm supposed to go
 when I'm going.
  </li><li>Oh babe, I continue.
 Anyway, I can't, I probably should go back and apologize to mom for that at some point.
 But anyway, went to, you know, why am they, they do everything as inexpensive as they
 can, right?
 So as inexpensive.
 Inexpensive, yeah.
 So, so we drove from Toronto to New Orleans in vans.
 And so I, you know, I brought all of my, my machines and my equipment with me to there,
 like my nebulizer and all that stuff.
 And then the plan was to leave it, New Orleans, fly from New Orleans into Honduras.
 And then, you know, assuming I was alive, it would be waiting for me in New Orleans when
 I got back.
 And so the final night before we're supposed to fly to Honduras, I was having this weird
 thing for a couple of years that had started when I was about 18 or 19, where my lungs
 would collapse or just part of my lungs would collapse.
 But that would start really bad attacks.
 And so I was, we were all having communion our whole YOM team.
 There's 52 on the team.
 And all of a sudden, one of my lungs went.
 And so I just left the group.
 I know what I need to do.
 I go in.
 I give myself a shot of adrenaline.
 I call the ambulance, you know, all that kind of stuff.
 And I'm thinking, well, I guess I'm not going, you know, because we're flying out at five
 o'clock the next morning.
 So I go in to where my bag is.
 I know where everything was.
 I have a medical bag that has a stripe on it that everybody knew it was going to be.
 mine. It always sat on top of my bag so I'd know where it was and it wasn't there. And I knew it
 had been there. So I went, and so I'm ripping open my bag and I'm having a hard time getting
 air. I'm in a lot of pain. I can't find it in my bag. So I ripped apart my cousin's bag and my
 friend Amber's bag. I couldn't find it anywhere. And then some friends of mine came in who were
 also on the school and they said, they looked at me and they said, "Well, first Jana came in and
 and she said, "Are you okay?"
 And I just looked at her and I sort of half gasped
 to call an ambulance.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
  </li><li>And so she ran out to call an ambulance,
 then the bass leaders came in with two friends of mine
 and just said, "Can we pray for you
 "while the ambulance is coming?"
 And I said, "Yes."
 And this one friend of mine had traveled with Derek Prince
 and they just started praying
 and he actually prayed a prayer of deliverance over me
 from a generational spirit of asthma and infirmity.
 And in an instant, my lung re-inflated,
 which was really painful actually,
 and the asthma attack just stopped,
 and I haven't had one since then.
 So it just, everything changed.
  </li><li>You got sozered.
  </li><li>I got sozered.
  </li><li>You got delivered and healed.
  </li><li>Delivered and healed.
  </li><li>So when you say you got healed,
 you went back to your doctor?
  </li><li>Well, first I went to Honduras.
  </li><li>Of course.
 weeks. And the, you know, there was other asthmatics on the trip, but they were what I call puffer
 asthmatics. Lightweights. Lightweights.
 Yeah, I'm a church. You know, but they just use little puffer's to manage their stuff.
 But they were, I mean, they were having a hard time. And I had promised my mom that I
 would call her every day. So, and it was a 45 minute walk to the phone that was in the
 village. So we'd like walk through the dust and all this, you know, monsoon season, and
 then it would dry out and get dusty again and just craziness to call her and tell her
 it was still alive today.
 But I did tell her mom I got healed, I'm gonna be fine.
 She was like, just call me.
 So when I got home, I went to go see my specialist.
 Same doctor.
 Same doctor.
 Yep.
 And I walked in and his, you know, I hadn't made an appointment or anything.
 I just wanted to show him I was okay, you know, because he was so concerned before I left.
 So I just walked in and said to the receptionist, "Can I see Dr. Thomas?"
 She looked at me like she was in shock and just nodded and didn't say anything.
 He had an office and then he had an exam room.
 So I just knocked on the door of the office and he opened the door and he looked at me
 and he was just totally in shock and he said, "You didn't go."
 I said, "No, I went.
 God healed me."
 He booked to do all the pulmonary function tests again.
 We did the whole round of tests and everything, and then I went back to meet with him.
 And he said, he actually wrote me a letter saying, "I cannot explain this as anything
 other than an act of God."
 He said, "My lungs on their very best day were a third the capacity that I have now."
 And he's like, "I never need to see you again.
 You are healed."
 And so that was that.
 But I mean, I had been prayed for so many times.
 Let's talk about that because I understand if you're in critical pain that there is comfort
 in holding to what I would call faulty theology, because at least it helps explain why you
 haven't been healed.
 Yeah.
 But the danger with that is it actually robs people of the very thing they need to get
 healed, which is encouragement, which is faith.
 Faith, hope.
 Yep.
 You know, all those sorts of things.
 Yep.
 So talk about like, obviously it was God's will to heal you.
 Yep.
 Obviously you were prayed for many times. Yes, but you didn't get healed. Do you have any clue why?
 Well, I think to the best of my knowledge nobody had ever tried the deliverance tracked which
 Asma did run in our family
 So my mom had like several cousins that had had very bad asthma and one that had died from it and all that kind of stuff so
 You know, I don't know nobody
 I think had ever gone the generational tract or anything like that and I certainly don't think it had anything to do with
 My faith because I had no faith for it. I was like as long as you phone the ambulance
 You guys can say your little prayer until it gets here. You know, I had no I mean when the ambulance came and
 And I was fine. I didn't even know how to explain it because it wasn't what I thought was gonna happen. Wow
 Yeah, I think about the story in the gospels where the disciples pray for the young boy that the demon possessed boy
 Yeah, and he doesn't get healed
 All right, and so that that's a conversation where the boy father goes to Jesus
 Hey, you're just a firefighter pray and and then and then Jesus prays for the boy and he gets healed now
 I sometimes like to do this for stories. I imagine this this father bringing this young boy
 So hey, would you pray for my son and the disciples pray for me doesn't get healed?
 What if he left that meeting and went home?
 He would conclude it. Oh, well, you know, perhaps he would conclude it wasn't God's will to heal my son
 Right.
 But all you need to do is wait and when actually God, you know, rather than coming up with
 your own theology, he actually introduced him to God, Jesus, God incarnate and just said,
 would you pray for my son?
 And then he gets healed.
 And I think there's such danger in refusing to say, I don't know and come up with our
 own theology is to explain our gap of experience and what's prescribed in scripture.
 Right.
 I think what's hard though is when you're really sick
 and it's really frustrating to be sick
 and not to beat it yet, it's hard to add to it.
 Could this, I mean, if we don't have a theology
 that says something like, which is totally false,
 but something like, God is teaching me through this,
 that's why I have it or it's, you know,
 it's not my time yet or whatever the thing is,
 then we can end up taking it on ourselves
 and saying there must be something wrong with me
 that God won't heal me.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So I don't have enough faith which is an ungodly.
  </li><li>Right, and that's unbearable.
  </li><li>That's unbearable.
 I remember speaking to John about that
 and he said, "own faith or lack thereof
 is rarely the problem."
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I said, "well what do you mean?"
 'Cause I was asking him, like,
 "why does some people not get healed when we pray for them?"
 And he said, "I don't know."
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>"What I do know is it's not because it's not God's will
 to heal them."
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I'll talk about that in a second,
 but he would say it's rarely, faith is rarely the issue.
 If I call out a word of knowledge
 and someone stands up in response sites,
 that's all the faith they need.
 If you think about it,
 faith the size of a mustard seed moves the mountain.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Everything else is easier after that.
  </li><li>Babe, I've just looked at the time
 and I need to go to the women's things.
 So can I just tell you a listeners question
 that you can answer?
  </li><li>Well, and then you're just gonna leave me on my own
 to finish this podcast.
  </li><li>I am, but just this time, not like on the usual.
  </li><li>I'm pretty sure I can wax lyrical on healing.
 I'm pretty sure you can for a very long time.
 (laughs)
 All right, I love you, have fun.
 Oh, yes.
  </li><li>Well, wait, you say the question
 and then I'll cut it in for the end
 so I can finish this segment.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Okay, so, ages left.
 I'm your solo host by the magic of editing.
 We'll hear her with a question in about five minutes or so.
 But we were talking about the danger
 of creating theology when we don't have answers.
 So you might say, well, Hannah and Alan, why is it faulty to say it's not God's timing or God's teaching me a lesson?
 Or, you know, I'm not good enough. Why are those not good reasons?
 For answering the question, why am I not healed?
 And I would simply say, I don't see that in the life of Jesus.
 Jesus has to be our benchmark for everything.
 If you can't see it in the life of Jesus, I'd be really, really reluctant to hold on to it as a theology.
 So for example, when the 10 lepers came to Jesus and has to be healed,
 He didn't amunar. He wasn't like, "Oh, I'd love to, but you know, you three, the father's really working on a character issue in you and you two.
 It's just really not your timing right now. And you, you know, you're not good enough to be healed."
 He just healed all ten of them. And we know from elsewhere in Scripture that Jesus said, "I don't do anything on the court.
 I only do what I see my father doing. I only say what I hear my father saying."
 So we realize that Jesus lived perfectly out of the will of God and with the number of people that he healed,
 I mean, in fact, everybody who came to Jesus for healing got healed. So you know it's God's will.
 You also know it's God's will because when the disciples ask Jesus to pray,
 the prayer that Jesus taught them was, "Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven."
 So you have to step back a bit. In heaven, God's will is done perfectly. There's no contest,
 there's no sin, there's no devil, there's no opposition. God's will is just carried
 out perfectly in heaven. In heaven, there's no sickness, there's no death, there's no sorrow.
 That's not an accident. It's because that's what God decrees. That's what God wills.
 And his instruction is that God's will would be done on earth as it is in heaven. So he
 wants the kingdom reality here on earth right now. And that's what Jesus demonstrated.
 back to that verse in Acts 10 verse 30 that he literally went around doing good and healing
 all those who were oppressed by the devil because God was with him. He was literally
 doing the mandate of his father. So, you know, people ask me, "How can you be so confident
 that God's will to heal?" And I would say the life of Jesus teaches me that and the
 instruction that Jesus gave his disciples in Matthew 10, he gives them a beginners list,
 going to the surrounding villages and do five things.
 Preach the gospel, cleans the leper, heal the sick,
 raise the dead, cast out demons.
 That was the beginner's list, five things.
 Just go do this.
 Matthew 28, he then says,
 hey, go make disciples of all nations,
 teaching them to do everything I taught you.
 So you see it's the will of God.
 Now, the problem is we've had,
 we being the church at large,
 have this spectacular track record of failure
 when it comes to healing.
 Sure, there are pockets of believers around the world
 who have got an incredible success ratio
 with healing the sick.
 But because of the lack of success that we've seen,
 we come up with clever sounding theologies
 that do more to explain our lack of anointing
 than they do accurately reflect the will of God.
 And that's where I get scared.
 I get scared when I'm around well-meaning Christians
 who try and talk us into having a lesser gospel
 the one that Jesus preached and the one that Jesus demonstrated. So when people ask me, hey, why
 why don't people get healed? My answer is, I don't know. I would be content to say it's a lack of
 anointing on our end. It could be unbelief our end. Often for me, when I've prayed for people and
 they haven't got healed, the very first thing I ask is how did it happen? And then the next question
 I ask is, did you forgive the people involved in how it happens? Because unforgiveness seems to be a
 big blockage in my own experience of ministering to people. But I'm never going to lay the blame
 of why people didn't get healed. I'm never going to lay it on one, it's not God's will to heal you.
 And two, it's because you don't have enough faith. If you've ever been prayed for somebody
 and you haven't been healed and you've been told the reason you didn't get healed is because you
 didn't have enough faith, that's biblically incorrect. Why do I say that? Well, there's plenty of
 examples where there wasn't faith on the behalf of the person who's being prayed for.
 You think about Lazarus, how much faith did Lazarus have? None. You think about the passage
 we were talking about earlier where the young man brings his son to be healed and he doesn't
 get healed. And so he goes to Jesus and Jesus asks him, "Anything's possible for those
 who believe." And he says, "I do believe, help me overcome my unbelief. Jesus is really
 good at helping us overcome our unbelief." So I feel bad that age is left and I feel
 bad that I'm just speaking to myself in a room. I think the thing that we wanted to
 raise is, in this series on back to basics, that healing is a basic foundational element
 of the kingdom of God, and I'm sad it's been elevated to a debate-worthy topic. It wasn't
 a debate-worthy topic in the life of Jesus, and it wasn't in the lives of the disciples
 or in the early church. The book of Acts is just filled with examples of believers falling
 on Jesus' model of demonstrating the Kingdom by preaching the Word and healing the sick.
 And I want to take a moment for those of you who are listening to this who are sick.
 I especially want to shout out to little Eva.
 One of my longest standing friends are a couple called Glennon on a quarter.
 I've known them for years and years and years.
 In fact, I've spent more of my life in friendship with them than I have not knowing them.
 And they have a daughter, her name is Eva, and she's been sick for now for 11, 12 weeks.
 So I want to pray for Eva, but also want to pray for everybody who's listening right now who is sick
 And I want to encourage you that is God's will that you would be well
 So if you would allow me to I want to pray for you
 And then I'm gonna give you some resources for anybody who's interested in growing in this area to help you grow and further
 your understanding of healing and the Kingdom of God
 So Lord Jesus
 I thank you that you died on the cross to pay the price for everything we need in life for the salvation of our sin
 for the healing of our bodies and for every provision that we're going to need in the natural and the spiritual realm and I
 Speak the healing bomb of Jesus Christ into everybody who's listening right now
 Lord I pray for deaf ears to open for blind eyes to be open for lame
 legs Lord to be straightened for diseases to leave for
 blood diseases to go for pain to vanish for healing to come into people's bodies and and even as people are listening to my
 words right now Lord I ask that the power of God would come into their bodies. I thank
 you that you taught us to pray your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is
 in heaven. And so Lord I ask for the grace of God, your most wonderful Holy Spirit to
 begin to flow through bodies right now, bringing healing and bringing change. Lord I thank
 you that it's your good pleasure to give us the kingdom. That healing is something we
 don't need to strive for or earn, it was purchased for us on the cross. And I ask right now,
 Lord Jesus, that your healing andointing would begin to flow into the lives of bodies, that
 there would be a marked change, that there would be healing, there would be demonstratable change
 in people's bodies, and the disease would go, that pain would go, and that healing would come
 in Jesus' name, Amen. You've been listening to this admittedly short and somewhat rushed
 talk on healing and you're like, man, I would love to learn a little bit more. There's a couple
 of resources I'd really recommend you get into. The first thing I would say is become a practitioner
 of healing. Don't get stuck in theory. A bigger waste of your time I cannot think of
 then going online and debating with people just stay away from that become a practitioner feeling just start healing the six start praying and asking the holy spirit for help and it's the fastest way i know how to grow your gift is to do your gift.
 Some authors I have really really been helped by in the past would be Randy Clark Bill Johnson John and Carol Arnett and Steve Long
 These are modern-day
 Practitioners of healing who are excellent at their craft that they've worked hard on the standing God's will
 Implementing healing I'll put some links in the show notes of some books. I really recommend Steve long has written an excellent book
 called this healing belongs to you and Steve
 is one of the best practitioners I've seen of healing.
 Every time he comes to Grace Center,
 we see incredible healings that happen,
 and he's got a way of making it super normal.
 Randy Clark and Bill Johnson sat down
 and kind of interviewed each other,
 and these guys have got like 10, 20, 30 years of ministry
 in watching God do miracles and heal the sick,
 and they talk about some fascinating things.
 I'll put the book that I'm thinking of,
 of the title that I can't remember in the show notes for you to read as well.
 And I encourage you, surround yourself by people who have a track record with healing,
 you will find that the number of miracles you see will increase.
 Every person I know that spends more time debating healing than praying for the sick
 to be healed see less miracles than those who spend time praying for people to be healed.
 It is hard for you and it's part of your inheritance.
 Right now by the magic of editing,
 AJ Jones, do you have a question for me?
  </li><li>All right, babe, here's the listeners question.
 This one's from Isaac.
 It says, "Hey, I love your podcast.
 "It's really fun to listen to
 "and I always get lots of interesting ideas from them."
 However, a couple of episodes ago,
 you said something that I'd love to hear more about
 as it's something I've not been able to figure out.
 I believe you said something along the lines of God
 not the author of our suffering. I really like the idea of this in premise, however,
 I find it difficult to reconcile this with the countless events in the Old Testament
 where God sends a famine or unleashes his fury. Also, in the New Testament, Jesus is
 asked why this person was sick, and he said it was so that the power could be seen in
 him from John 9 verse 3. Could you clarify what you meant when you said God is not the
 author of our suffering and what the Bible says on that.
 Thanks!
 Isaac, such a fantastic question.
 I want to start by telling you a little something I learned as a child and it goes like this.
 The old contains the new concealed, the new contains the old revealed.
 And basically what it's saying is that in order to understand the Old Testament properly,
 It is helpful to read it through a New Testament filter. All right, so your question
 relies upon there being two versions of God. And now you probably wouldn't agree with that,
 but hear me out on that. Yes, it's possible to read the Old Testament and see God bringing about the destruction of
 villages and
 countries and nations and judgments and sicknesses and plagues coming on people and conclude that well, this is what God is like.
 But you actually have to keep reading the story to get a fuller version of who God is and that's one of the reasons that God sent Jesus.
 Listen to what the writer of Hebrews says.
 This is this in the past, as in the Old Testament, in the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways.
 But in these last days, he is spoken to us by his son, that's Jesus, whom he appointed heir of all things and through whom he also made the universe.
 The Sun is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being.
 My point there is when we read the Old Testament we get a glimpse of the Lord.
 When we read the Gospels and we see Jesus, that's when we get to see the exact
 representation of his being. So so many Christians fall into the trap of having an Old Testament God and a New Testament God.
 They have one foot in the Old Testament and they have one foot in the New Testament.
 that if you get to read Old Testament scripture with a New Testament mindset.
 So Jesus came to reveal the heart of the Father.
 When you see Jesus walking around day by day, you understand that's exactly who God is.
 So any image of God that you have that cannot be found in the life of Jesus is an image of
 God that's worth questioning.
 Jeff Daller this morning, our senior pastor at Grace and I preached an amazing message
 this morning. And in it, he just threw out the statement, and let me read it to you.
 Does your God look like Jesus? If your view of God, of what God is like and how God thinks
 and how God behaves, can't be found in the life of Jesus, I'm highly suspicious that
 your view of God is faulty.
 A.W. Joseph said that what you think about God is the most important thing about you.
 So Isaac, when you asked this brilliant question, you know, because I said God is not the author
 of our suffering. There's a danger that we live in present-day reality and ascribe that
 what we're going through is God's plan. Often when I'm teaching this, I like to find something
 in the front row that I know and I like to walk up to them and I smack them across the
 head, right? So it makes a great loud noise. And I ask the congregation, "Was it God's
 desire that that happened?" And people would say, "No, it's not God's desire that I go
 around hitting people at the side of the head." And so people would say, "No, it's not God's
 desire that would happen and I say yet it happened anyway. There is lots of stuff that
 happens that is not what God wants. So it says elsewhere in Scripture that surely God
 desires none would perish and yet every day people are perishing by the vote load. What's
 going on right there? Well you have to make sure that you're attributing to God is consistent
 with what we know as character to be as revealed by Jesus. For example, many people attribute
 to God, what if we were to attribute to an earthly father that earthly father should
 be locked up for?
 Right?
 So you, you, I mean, I meet this all the time.
 People experience some sort of tragedy and say, you know, it's just, it's just God just
izing those he loves.
 And I'm like, wait, if I was an earthly father who like just broke my 11 year old daughter's
 arm, just a teacher, um, patience to teach her long suffering to teach her what it's
 like to write with her left hand instead of her right, I would rightly be locked up
 as a child abuser. And we would not believe that I'm a loving father. And yet routinely
 we use a faulty view of God from an Old Testament, partial understanding of God and his nature,
 gloss over all the revealed nature of Jesus and attribute that to God. Jesus in John 10
 10 talks about two completely different dynamics. He talks about the thief comes to steal, kill,
 and destroy. I've come that you may have life and have it abundantly. So if you take
 that verse you understand that stealing, killing and destruction is not the work of the Lord
 but is actually the work of the evil one.
 But life and life abundant comes from the Lord.
 We have this challenge, talks about in Romans 12, where we need to be transformed by the
 renewing of our mind.
 We have picked up old habits of attributing bad things to the heart of God that doesn't
 actually exist in his heart.
 You need to be people who are confident that God is good, that God is kind, that God is
 loving and not split hairs about what good, kind and loving is because I've heard theologians
 bend over backwards to fit mistreatment into the heart of God.
 And I'm like, that's just not what God is like.
 It's just not who God is.
 Every person that came to Jesus for help, for example, were not met with punishment.
 I can't find any record of Jesus in the life of Jesus, Jesus inflicting sickness on people.
 I only see Jesus removing sickness from people.
 That's why I'm confident Isaac that God is not the author of our suffering.
 Then you bring up this brilliant verse in John 9 verse 3.
 Let me read it for context.
 John 9 verse 1 says, "As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man who had been blind from
 birth.
 Rabbi, his disciples asked him, 'Why was this man born blind?
 Is it because of his own sins or his parent sins?
 John 9 verse 3, "It was not because of his sins or his parent sins."
 Jesus answered.
 This happened so that the power of God can be seen in him.
 You've got to remember when any of us read a passage of text, we bring something to the
 text with us.
 We bring our pre-understanding, we bring our own perspective, we bring our own upbringing,
 we bring our own bias.
 Everyone does that, myself included.
 But Isaac in the context of your question, you said this.
 I really like the idea of God not being the author of your suffering and premise.
 However, I find it difficult to reconcile this with the countless events in the Old Testament
 where God sent a famine or unleashes this fury.
 So I'm hearing you say, "Hey, this is my perspective of what God is like based on my
 reading of my Old Testament."
 And so it's not a big surprise for me that when you come to read this passage in John
 chapter 9 verse 3 that you're reading that is, "Ah, the reason that this man was blind
 was orchestrated by God so that he could demonstrate Jesus' power in healing.
 When I read that passage and I read that Jesus answered, "This happened so that the power of God can be seen in him."
 I'm reading what Jesus is about to do, which is heal him.
 And I refer you back to Acts 10, verse 38, that what Jesus did was he went around doing good
 and healing all who were under the power of the devil because God was with him.
 So when you take this verse on its own with a view that God is anger in the Old Testament,
 it's perfectly understandable how you read chapter 9 verse 3 of John's gospel that,
 "Oh yeah, God actually decided to blind this kid so that his power could be seen in him."
 But on closer inspection, it doesn't make much sense.
 One in the context of the Gospels, where you don't see an example of Jesus blinding anyone
 in the reverse, you see him opening eyes.
 So that's number one and number two when you take it in the greater context of the Gospels S summarized in Acts 10 verse 38
 That Jesus went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil
 So Luke's perspective and Luke would have been with the disciples arguably in this passage him being blind was an act of the power of the devil
 Then we take John 10 10 when the thief comes to steal kill and destroy
 But I've come to give them life and life abundant
 You see really really clearly here that that Jesus is actually doing the work of the kingdom and the work of the kingdom is restoring sight
 Not having him blinded the fourth thing I would throw in if Jesus only did the will of the father
 Which we know that's the case and your premise and it sounds like I'm trying to fight you Isaac
 And I'm not forgive me if it sounds like that
 But if your premise is that God actually blinded this young man
 Why would Jesus undo what his father had done?
 Right so when I take those four things together. I don't read John 9 verse 3 as
 God blinding this young man. I read this as Jesus healing this young man
 It comes back to that wonderful quote from AW toes of the what you think about God is the most important thing about you
 Everything you're gonna receive in this life stem from what you think of God and what you think God thinks of you
 It is so important that we have settled in our heart that God is good and that God is
 kind, that God is for us, that He's not against us.
 Otherwise, when we face seasons of our life that contain destruction or death or theft,
 there's a danger that if we don't have this settled in our heart, we will try and find
 God in the midst of our suffering rather than God as the solution to our suffering.
 So Isaac, it's a great question.
 I'm not sure how well I answered that.
 I really miss having my wife here to kind of explain
 what I'm saying or bounce things back,
 but I hope that made sense.
 If you have a question that you would like us to answer,

 and we will do our best to answer you.
 So there's our hop, skip and a jump
 through our teaching on healing
 with a brilliant question from Isaac.
 Thank you so much for listening.
 I mentioned earlier that we received copies of A.G.'s book
 that were back in stock.
 If you'd like to order a book for a loved one or for yourself,
 especially for Christmas this year, you might want to do that fairly quickly,
 because one, there's a high chance that they might sell out again.
 Number two, shipping in the US, domestic US cuts off December 20th.
 So if you want to book and you want it to arrive before Christmas,
 December 20th is the last day that we can ship it here.
 And that only works for the domestic US.
 If you're ordering from outside of the US, I'm afraid the cutoff to receive a book
 by Christmas happened last Saturday.
