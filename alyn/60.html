<p> AJ Jones. Yes, sir. You find piece of Canadian engineering. How are you? Better now that you're
 home. It feels we're taking a week off podcasting. It does. I don't know how we could have done
 it on us week anyway, though. No, it was pretty genius of us to decide we weren't going to do it.
 Yes. But nevertheless, when I sat down tonight, I was like, wait, how do we do this again?
 You've forgotten in two weeks time how to podcast? Well, I hope it still works.
 Okay. Everybody, welcome to episode 60 of Keeping Up With The Joneses.
 Wow. Those that follow us weekly or if you just listened to our little preamble,
 you know that we took last week off.<br/>
 And that was because we had a vacation in Florida.
 Just give us a vacation update.<br/>
 Well, it was awesome.<br/>
 We didn't actually find out we were going away on vacation until the evening
 before the morning that we left.<br/>
 That was very fun.<br/>
 Somebody called and said, Hey, I'd love to send you on vacation tomorrow.
 And we went, yeah.<br/>
 and we told Tia who'd been praying for a vacation.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah.
  </li><li>When we told her Tia, our six year old,
 that we were doing a staycation, she...
  </li><li>Squared mouth cried.
  </li><li>And just said, "But I prayed out loud three times
 "to Jesus."
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Probably prayed out loud.
  </li><li>She couldn't understand why it hadn't happened.
 So she was relieved when it had happened
 at the 11th hour.
  </li><li>And she'd made the, she totally made the connection.
 She's like, "Jesus heard me, he knew I wanted a beach."
 It was so cute.
  </li><li>So we drove seven hours to beach and it was fantastic.
  </li><li>It was lovely.
 And we discovered what we didn't discover.
 We're not the original discoverer.
 That's not like we're Marco Polo.
 No.
 Back with Tales of Adventure.
 Or Columbus.
 Whoever.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 But we happened upon the tiny little town of Seaside in Florida.
 I love it.
 I totally get it now.
 People around here, you see these stickers in the back of people's cars that say 30A.
 And I'd be like, get over it people.
 It's like a highway.
 No, 30A is a very specific strip of beaches, and I totally get it now.
 It was where the Truman Show was filmed with Jim Carrey. So we watched it.
 Yes. And then went and visited all the places, including his house and did the touristy thing
 of taking our foot in front of it. And we did. Our revelation was that our kid
 drew on the spectrum of swimming. T doesn't care. It has no interest in learning to swim.
 just wants to flow around her ring. Abby thinks she can swim, but really can't. And is a hazard to
 herself. Well, no, she by the end of the week, she was doing much, much better. Like I was much
 less, oh my gosh, I'm going to watch her drown. Right. But the thing is she can swim really well
 underwater now. But when she comes up for her, she can't tread water. So unless she's in water
 that she can put her foot down on, she is going to drown. Right. And then MJ is just leave me alone.
 I want in the water and we'll jump off.
 Which is why we have to leave him in like this floating life jacket thing because he just gets
 out jumps in doesn't care, no fear. Yeah, they're all different.
 Yeah, so we're like fantastic time.
 We did and we discovered the food trucks at seaside.
 And I had possibly the best grilled cheese of my entire existence.
 Oh, so good.
 I can't remember what it was.
 No, Texas tools.
 Turkey milk.
 Yeah, but what was on it?
 avocado, some sort of special spicy sauce. Turkey. Say Turkey again. Turkey. Are you from a foreign land?
 Turkey. That was very good. And then sadly, while we were on vacation, we found out my mum died.
 Yeah, on the second day there. Happy vacation.
 No, well, what we've been known, we've been known.
 We've known for a long time, my mum is dying.
 And in recent weeks, we knew that it was imminent.
 And so it wasn't like, you know,
 we could put our life on hold.
 So we knew full well that it was more than likely
 she was going to pass away while we were on vacation.
 Yeah, because we had two weeks off.
 But she did, she passed away,
 which is very, very sad, of course.
 But under the circumstances, the quality of life she had
 while dying from cancer.
 And there was somewhat of a relief.
 I mean, this season is a weird juxtaposition of feelings.
 So it feels weird to say it was a relief that your mum died,
 that you know, those words sound horribly calloused.
 But in the context of what she was going through, it was really, yeah.
 And it's amazing. She's in heaven.
 Yeah. It's very sad that she died.
 But if you're going to be given bad news, I'd much rather have that bad news
 in a beautiful place.
 Yeah, it was easier to distract the kids, but poor, poor Tia.
 When when grandpa called and said that she'd gone into a coma and would probably be a couple of hours, of course, they didn't understand what a coma was.
 So they thought she'd gone into a cocoon, like a caterpillar.
 So I was trying to explain that she's sleeping. Well, could we send letters? Could somebody read her letters and, you know, but they didn't, they didn't really get it.
 But Tia, she bald, didn't she?
 Well, once we told them that Nana had died.
 Yeah.
 She said, well, who's going to be my Nana now?
 And then she said, I don't want a new number.
 I love you.
 Just purchase them somewhere.
 Yeah.
 So, yeah, that was very sad, but we still managed to enjoy the rest of her vacation.
 Yeah.
 And then we drove home from Florida, Deere Laundry, and then I flew out again.
 Yeah.
 And in fact, have just flown back.
 I've just literally got off the plane.
 And so we haven't even caught up.
 How was your week while I was away before I tell you about my week?
 It was good.
 I had help from Miss Cindy Luhu.
 She came over Monday, Wednesday and Friday and helped me and then.
 And then you helped her in Star Wars education.
 I did. I, I educated her.
 I never seen.
 I don't think you educate her so much.
 I think you showed her the Star Wars movies and hoped that somehow,
 by osmosis, she would understand what was going on.
 That was not the case.
 No, she started, she started asking last questions and getting it more by
 the time I got to return to the Jedi.
 And then she said, do you have one, two, and three?
 And I said, I don't, but I could see if somebody does.
 We can borrow them.
 She's like, well, either that or we need to watch four, five, and six again.
 I thought, ah-ha, you've got the book.
 But I did have to answer lots of questions in episode one.
 So maybe, you know, she's, she's in process.
 You know, there's just lots of strange names and places.
 How did the kids survive without me?
 They, they did okay.
 There was moments of sadness.
 MJ struggled. Poor MJ had the runs three days this week and was cutting a tooth and daddy's gone.
 And so every morning he would, he calls for you, of course, every morning. And then he go,
 "Where daddy, where daddy?" Diarrhea in cutting your teeth is one of the side effects of not being
 close to me. Yeah. Be warned people the farther away you are from Alan.
 But he was very happy to see me when I arrived tonight. Oh, he was. Not least because
 Grandpa and I went and bought him a transformer.
 Yes.
 So I'm back.
 We just had Mexican food.
 We did.
 Which I missed for the six days that I was away.
 How was your week, babe?
 Well, you know, you know, given the circumstances.
 You know, we recorded a podcast with my mom earlier this year.
 I mean, we got to go over in February and February, the doctors
 basically called my dad and said, look, she's got 10 days to live.
 And so all our family flew from around the world to come and be with net.
 And that was an amazingly precious time to have that time and we all have to say goodbyes because we weren't quite sure how long she was going to live.
 Little did we know she was going to plan on living till July.
 And just last week the doctor came to see her told my dad she's got the constitution of somebody I've never seen before.
 And so it was really really good to be there for 10 days with the kids and she absolutely beat out all odds of expectation.
 you wouldn't have even known really in February other than she was using a walker
 because she was a little bit wobbly.
 She seemed like her normal self like she didn't she didn't look sick.
 And so going back this time obviously was a little more sober because mama
 isn't there.
 The interesting thing about the week was I was only there for six days.
 The momentum of the activity carries you through it without really any
 opportunity to process what's happening.
 Right.
 So I try to sleep on the way over because I was flying through the night and then you land,
 then you pick up your car, then you drive up, then I drove straight to the church to kind of
 rehearse for the following day. And then you, you know, you go to the burial and that was kind of
 surreal. I lowered my mum into her grave. That was just really weird. And then you go to the
 funeral and then you go to a big reception afterwards and I see lots of people I haven't seen in 30
 years. That was even more surreal. I catch up with some people I do know. And then the
 next day, because family's in town, you all have a big kind of family get together. And
 the next day you meet up with more family, didn't get a chance to see the day before.
 And then the next day you drive through to Edinburgh. And then the next day you're on
 a plane and you come home and you're just like, what just happened? So I think probably,
 I think it was Dan Fanner that said your head will lie to you, but your body will not.
 Yeah, so I think I'm not trying to lie to myself but I think in my head I'm like no I understand what's happened my mom has died.
 We've had a distinct advantage of having eighteen or so months.
 To come to terms with that and I think I'm getting on with life but here's what was interesting was the poor guy at customs and immigration when I flew back into.
 United States I'm in line and you know he stand for passports is where were you as in Scotland we said we there for business or pleasure.
 And I just blurted out right as if neither I was there burning my mother.
 And as soon as I said that I started welling up with tears and the poor man,
 you know, as I got this grown man, you know,
 just kind of tearing up being super blunt.
 He's like, I'm sorry for your loss.
 Welcome home.
 Stand my passport and let me in.
 And I'm just like, okay, that's interesting.
 My, my eyeballs are manifesting something that perhaps my head hasn't quite caught up with.
 Right.
 So grieving is a process, babe.
 It is.
 And I think all of our family were noticing it comes in waves, comes and goes.
 So that was what the week was like.
 It just took care of itself because there was so much to do.
 And every day there was a new activity.
 And I think that's the danger that you ride that thing out.
 So I'm trying to be kind to myself.
 I'm trying to be good to myself and give myself space and opportunity to grieve.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 And that's probably what the next little bit looks like.
 I think you're worried I'm going to milk it though. I'm sorry, babe. I don't want to empty dishwasher right now. I'm in the process of grieving.
 It's possible. I'm sorry. I need to have another cheeseburger.
 I can't change M. J's bum. I'm in the process of grieving. I could totally see this happening.
 Okay. Well, I'll try and be very honoring to the whole situation. But it was great to see my family.
 Strange circumstances, but nevertheless, good to see my family. But you know, this, the main topic that I wanted to talk about, and I presume you're okay with this.
 Yes.
 Is that I'd like to talk about my mom?
 Okay, I might cry.
 Oh, you can cry.
 Thanks.
 We already did a podcast with my mom.
 Mm-hmm.
 I don't know what episode number was, but I'll put it in the show notes.
 And I'm really, really glad that we did that.
 We've got my mom recorded and you can hear her talking in our lovely little Welsh accent.
 I'm glad we got these little mementos.
 Um, she's amazing.
 She was an amazing mother.
 and I did a little talk at the funeral, which was hard to do in one sense, but it was something I
 really wanted to do and a version of what I said, we already put up online, if you go to our show
 notes, you'll find a link to them. And in that talk, I talked about some of her qualities. I want to
 talk about three different qualities from the ones I already talked about, because she had so many
 of them. There's a little bit of overlap. I'm going to kind of cheat. The first I already talked about,
 but it was her compassion i told a story at the funeral that's completely true that illustrates the way my mom lives her life.
 The doctor who is discharging her from hospital basically sending her home to die basically had the conversation said we can't do anything more for you all the medical treatments available to you have not worked i'm so sorry you're not dying.
 just go home, put your affairs in order. And so that's terrible news to hear, but that's not
 what my mom picked up. My mom on the way home was like to my dad, oh, that poor man, like,
 can you imagine having a job like that? That must have been such a hard conversation for him to have.
 We should send him a card. And she did. But that's, that's how my mom lived. I remember being
 in primary school, which is elementary school for our North American audience.
 and there was a boy in my class who would bully me.
 I mean, you know, he would chase me home and beat me up and all that sort of stuff.
 My dad's response was very pragmatic.
 It was to come to school and have a word with this bully face to face, which was perfect.
 My mom's response was, I just still remember the conversation like, "Oh, the poor boy's from a broken home.
 He doesn't know who his dad is.
 He imagined how hard that would be.
 No wonder he's lashing out."
 And so here am I in the midst of being traumatized with this boy suddenly finding
 compassion for this boy because my mom has compassion for this boy.
 Contagious compassion contagious compassion.
 I think in our understanding of life languages and if you're familiar with life
 languages, we should do a podcast online.
 But anyway, I would say that she's a very high responder, very high influencer.
 So she just trips with compassion.
 I'm thinking even as remember meeting her the first time and she just love so well her heart just sort of goes out to everybody.
 I don't you know you know she I don't remember her saying judgmental things are you know she just sort of loved well.
 Mm hmm.
 Do you know my second thought yeah.
 She was she had this incredible confidence.
 And who she was and not only was she confident in who she was but she had this ability to import that confidence to others so i all i remember being told.
 Through my whole childhood was that i was brilliant that was amazing anything i i did that was an accomplish my mother some of my mother wasn't impressed by it but she was just like well of course you could do that you're brilliant you're amazing so all of us just grow up understanding.
 that we were brilliant and we all have this confidence that came from her and so she always told us that she loved us.
 There's never any doubt of us being supported.
 I'm not sure how she managed to do this but i don't know if this is related to your confidence but she was always interested in everyone and everything.
 Yeah.
 Like, I would watch it on thinking, are you putting this on?
 Is this like the social work side of you?
 But she was genuinely interested in everyone and everything.
 Well, and you see that with the grandkids and stuff, both the confidence thing and being
 genuinely interested.
 Like, I remember being there at one point and I think Allison's kids phoned and sometimes
 I have a hard time with the accents because I don't understand, you know what you're saying.
 And just watching her on the phone.
 And as far as I know they're saying, I made a mud pie today and she's like, aren't you
 brilliant?
 Oh, you're wonderful kind of thing.
 And they would tell her like in real time what had happened that day, each of the individual
 six children.
 And she would be totally interested in the whole thing.
 Like, you know, it's an hour long conversation and she's totally engaged.
 I don't know where she got that from.
 I certainly didn't pick that from her.
 I have a very narrow set of interests.
 That's true.
 But she didn't, she was encyclopedic in her fascination with people and topics.
 True?
 Or you too?
 What's your last one?
 My last one is the topic of devotion.
 When I look at my mum, when I remember the things that she did, she didn't just do things,
 she was devoted to doing things.
 So she was a devoted wife.
 who's a devoted mother.
 And boy, did I probably stretch her devotion.
 We were all swapping stories at the various hair colors I had
 and the various hairstyles I had
 that must have stretched my mother's grave.
  </li><li>Dreadlocks.
  </li><li>Yeah, must have driven her nuts.
 I remember a story that she told me years later,
 but some of you'll notice,
 'cause I've talked about it several times when I teach,
 I don't think I've talked about it in the podcast, maybe I have.
 When I was 21 years old, I had a breakdown and it was a horrible season of my life.
 And so my mother told me this years later, but she said when she discovered that I
 was going through all this mental anguish and this breakdown, she said, I took,
 she said, I took hold of myself and I said to myself, Lana, there is nothing
 you can do to fix your boy.
 There's nothing you can do.
 You cannot make this go away.
 So she said, "I decided there and then I wasn't going to waste time and anguish.
 I was going to be pragmatic."
 She said, "So I got myself an alarm clock, like a digital alarm,
 and I set the alarm for every hour and every hour when the alarm would go off,
 I would pray for you."
 And I was like, "That's incredible devotion."
 But that's the way she lived her life, just super intentional,
 though to the outside it may look, she was a little disorganized.
 There was always an intention, always a purpose in everything she was doing.
 Even, I talked a little bit about this at the funeral, but her devotion to what she
 read and understood in the scriptures was amazing.
 She had a reason for everything she did.
 There were areas of our theology where our beliefs didn't align, but she was not only
 devoted to her beliefs, but I think she respected my devotion to my beliefs even though she
 didn't necessarily believe in what in areas of what I believed, does that make sense?
 Right.
 But I think she kind of honored the devotion that I showed to those things.
 So there you go.
 There's three additional things in addition to what I talked about on the funeral about
 her compassion, her confidence and her devotion.
 I would add to your devotion thing too, that her devotion to her grandkids like once a month,
 we would get something in the mail.
 you know some sort of little coloring book or
 like tivity something rather even after she got diagnosed even when she was sick she was still sending us these little.
 Things in the mail in the kids with just like go crazy for them you know but she just remembered you know it's crazy is.
 In the last couple of weeks should save you magazine's yet you're magazine's yeah i went over to our house i found the one she hadn't shipped.
 she thought she'd mailed them. I brought them home for the kids.
 But yeah, even within the last couple of weeks of her life, she'd made sure that there was comic
 books to be shipped over. She's amazing. I wanted to stop and thank everybody for the cards and the
 Facebook messages and the emails and the prayers and the texts that people sent and many huge
 deal to me. And I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to do that. Even though we knew
 it was coming, it was still bewildering for it to happen, but the support of many of you
 really, really, really encouraged me and encouraged my family.
 And those of you that helped me as well, like Cindy, Molly, Kate, Julie, that came over
 and helped me with the kids and helped me make it through the week with my messed up shoulder
 and stuff.
 I'd super appreciate that.
 And then tomorrow we go back to work, everything.
 Yeah.
 about the normal, which I think I'm going to appreciate.
 Yeah.
 I think you're going to have to speak at Emily, because I'm
 going to be jet lag tomorrow night.
 Oh, I've already put something together.
 What do you speak on?
 Can you give us a sneak peek?
 Uh, I'm speaking on grabbing a hold of your destiny.
 Ooh.
 Out of second Kings.
 I love it.
 So I'm going to tell you.
 Do you want to list this question?
 Sure.
 All right.
 We've got a question from Patrick.
 Patrick asks, when you passed are lots of people.
 How do you not carry their burdens while still remaining sensitive to their needs?
 And how do you pass through people when you have trouble caring about their issues?
 Where is the balance?
 Methamphetamine is Patrick lots and lots of methamphetamine.
 I'm joking.
 Just kidding.
 I would say I tend to.
 I do carry people's burdens probably after I should have.
 Let them go like just to my heart and I pray, but I,
 I will get to the point eventually where I feel overwhelmed by it sometimes.
 And that's usually when the Holy Spirit is going, Hey,
 Hey, my job, you're trying to do my job and I have to go, Oh, right.
 You're big, you're huge.
 You know where they are.
 You know the deal, you know, me carrying anxiety for them is not going to
 change anything.
 Right.
 And, and let it go.
 And so, and sometimes that process happens really quickly.
 and sometimes it takes me longer to realize that the reason I'm feeling the way I'm feeling
 is because I'm carrying something he didn't ask me to carry.
 So I think you can love people, love them well, pray for them, give them good advice
 without actually carrying their stuff into the next day or into the next meeting.
 And I would say I'm still in process on doing that well, but I'm a lot better at it than
 I was six or seven years ago.
 I think also clarifying in your head that worry does not equal care.
 Right.
 So you can meet with somebody that you, they can tell you just,
 just the harshest things ever that's going on in their life.
 And I think especially early on in ministry, like I have very easy
 ability to compartmentalize, like I could leave that meeting and be absolutely
 connected in the moment.
 And then it's not that I don't care, but it just doesn't pop into my head again.
 And that.
 Yeah.
 I can't do that.
 No, no, no.
 But I think the absence of my worry doesn't mean I don't care.
 Right.
 That makes sense.
 I mean, I do care.
 It's just completely responsible to imagine that it's my job.
 Somewhere along the line, people think, "Oh, well, if you're not worrying about it, then
 you really don't care."
 You're like, "Well, no, Jesus himself said, 'Who have you by worrying about your life?'"
 I'm not saying I worry.
 I'm saying I carry it.
 I just think I constantly pray for people and you know, whatever.
 I'm not, I'm not worried that God's not going to break through for them.
 Right.
 I'm not worried that God hasn't got it.
 I just pray for them because I can understand how difficult it must be for
 their hearts in the midst of it.
 See, there's a different between age and I tell AJ your worries, not me.
 Oh dear.
 Then I think, I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm josting there, but there's some truth to that.
 I wonder if it's a guy girl thing though.
 probably. And to clarify, it's not that I don't care or I am disinterested. I think I learned a
 long time ago that who by worrying can add a single hour to your life, and by worry, I mean,
 you know, holding it, massaging it, you know, I just I've got such confidence in God to be God,
 and it's not my job to be God that makes it really, really easy for me to handle, you know,
 multiple things. And of course, there's been times and situations, of course, when you get
 extreme situations where it's overwhelming.
 But the other good thing is we're part of a team.
 There's a team of 20-something pastors at Grey Center.
 And so we help carry a load, which is great.
 So I'm not sure if I've answered your question, Patrick,
 but I think like everything,
 there's some aspects of our job that are a job.
 And so you, I think what we learned a long time ago
 is everybody's pain is unique to them.
 So we certainly don't, you know, sometimes this is danger
 that you meet with people and what they have to share
 seems really, really trivial,
 especially in light of maybe some of the other
 pastoral loads that you're carrying.
 But we never think like that
 because everybody's pain is unique to them.
  </li><li>And it's real.
  </li><li>And it's real.
 So there isn't an element that we don't care.
 And then I think the really, really, really big stuff
 is thankfully there's a team of people
 that can carry that load.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I think it kind of all works out in the wash.
 It's not a very helpful answer, but I don't know whether--
 I don't know whether.
 And to qualify, I think the only stuff that I ever get bogged down or overwhelmed by is
 typically the really, really big stuff.
 Right.
 Otherwise, I'm pretty good at releasing things back to the Lord a lot faster.
 I mean, not that I'm carrying the other ones, but they weigh on my heart a lot heavier.
 Pretty good.
 Yeah.
 Anything you want to say in wrap up?
 I'm happy to have you home.
 I miss your mom already.
 To you.
 Yeah, I do.
 was amazing. It was absolutely amazing. I mean, really, I'm so thankful that I did get to know her
 for like 11 years. She, just her being her brought a lot of healing to me. And I'm sure that was true
 for so many people. That was certainly the feedback we got at the funeral. Well, thanks guys for tuning
 in. I'm sorry that we missed you last week. Hope you are having an amazing time. Get in contact
