<p> I'll in an AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Welcome to episode 191 of Keeping Up with Joneses.
 Where this week we are talking about the joy of navigating transitions.
 Is it worth noting that you have a headache for this episode?
 It might be.<br/>
 And we'll have to speak quieter because you have a headache?
 Well, at least a little bit quieter.<br/>
 So I shouldn't be super excited.<br/>
 Not if you want to sleep well tonight, not worrying about being stabbed by a fork.
 Oh, oh, got real dangerous real quick.
 How are you, Mrs. Jones, apart from the headache?
 I'm good apart from the headache.<br/>
 I think it's just the, uh, is this a low pressure system or high pressure system that brings rain low, right?
 I find it interesting.<br/>
 You think I don't know the answer to that question.
 Okay.<br/>
 Well, whatever, the pressure system that brought rain brought me a headache, I think.
 It's easy.<br/>
 Not that I want to be kind of essentially boring and talk about the weather, but the weather this week.
 Just so annoying, warm and then cold and raining and then warm.
 It doesn't know what it is.<br/>
 It's like I'm back in Scotland, except for the warm parts.
 Right.<br/>
 I mean, yesterday was 82 degrees and sunny.
 It was beautiful.<br/>
 Now we're back in the 50s and raining.
 I'm so confused.<br/>
 Terrifying.<br/>
 Tell me about this week.<br/>
 It was a great week.<br/>
 Monday and Tuesday, we had two very wonderful teachers on the school, obviously you teaching
 on the importance of church. And Jeff teaching on, I don't know what Jeff taught on because I
 wasn't in there. Abundant living, I think. Jeff honors around and just emanates wisdom, I think.
 Yeah, they ask a lot of questions and stuff and draw stuff out of them, which is very fun.
 Becky comes in, you know, laser.<br/>
 A glittery.<br/>
 A floor.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah, Monday and Tuesday.<br/>
 Monday, I can remember what I spoke on.
 I think I spoke on God's willingness to answer prayer.
 Oh, you mean Monday night?<br/>
 Yeah, Monday night.<br/>
 I was at a middle school meeting for parents, so I wasn't there.
 Yeah, no, you weren't there to support me on.
 You weren't there to support me in a middle school meeting and cheer me on.
 We'll talk about that later.<br/>
 Wednesday was Abigail's 11th birthday, and she was so excited because she got her own
 iPhone.<br/>
 She is just a little bit excited about that phone.
 I spent all the weeks before doing research on how to lock down an iPhone for a teenager.
 And so it is locked, baby.<br/>
 And then we went to the Cheesecake Factory as is our family tradition.
 Yes.<br/>
 And it was so sweet.<br/>
 Your mom was still here.<br/>
 Yeah, she stayed an extra couple of days because it was so close to Abby's birthday.
 So she stayed on.<br/>
 And so she was there for the birthday, which was great.
 Which was a big deal because she's our only surviving grandparent.
 Yes.<br/>
 Thursday, we took the day off.
</p><ul>
  <li>We did.
  </li><li>You still managed to schedule meetings in your day off.
  </li><li>I did, but in fairness to me,
 those meetings were scheduled
 before I realized we were taking the day off.
  </li><li>Oh, I see.
  </li><li>And so they were difficult to unschedule.
  </li><li>Thursday, we also said goodbye to your mom.
  </li><li>We did, yeah.
 She headed out back for Canada.
  </li><li>And a treat for me, you came to my grief, counselor.
  </li><li>I did.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>I wanna talk about this for a little bit
 'cause I'd love to get your perspective.
 So for everybody who's listening,
 I've been seeing a grief counselor for, I don't know, a couple of months now, a lovely, lovely
 guy.
 And the weird thing about doing any sort of counseling, which I'm a big fan of, unsurprisingly,
 the weird thing about it is an entirely fabricated process.
 I mean, it's just, unlike any other part of your life, like you take an hour out of your
 day, you go somewhere you would normally do and you spend an hour talking about yourself.
 Too stranger.
 Too a stranger.
 Who, you know, is no longer a stranger, but it's just, it's a bizarre thing.
 And I said, you know, part of the problem, this whole process, I said to my grief counselors,
 you're getting a really unfair sample of what I'm like, because, you know, the only
 thing you've got to go on is what I'm telling you to.
 And so I want to make sure you have as enough accurate data as possible.
 So I said, can I bring my wife?
 And he was like, you're of course, you're welcome to bring your wife.
 What are you hoping to get out of bringing your wife?
 And I'm like, well, I just think it would be great.
 I think you'll understand me more by meeting AJ
 'cause I'm one half of Ellen and AJ.
 Plus, I think it'd be great for her to meet with you.
 So what was it like for you?
 I loved that you came.
 I felt super loved, super supported.
 What was your observations?
  </li><li>It was interesting 'cause I felt like the first 20 minutes
 was you trying to update me at mock speeds
 with high influencer about the entire process
 that's taking place for four months or something.
  </li><li>Because for whatever reason,
 we don't really talk about it
 'cause it's the pace of our life.
  </li><li>Right.
 If something major happens, I'll say, "Hey, this majorly happened," but generally speaking,
 it's just another event in our week.
 Right.
 So I wasn't sure if at the end of this I had to buy a car or what the deal was, but it
 was just like, "Wow, that was bad."
 And it's interesting because he doesn't really interject unless he's invited to.
 Right.
 So that was interesting.
 Also he looks a lot like your best friend in Scotland.
 Which I didn't realize until you've blamed that.
 like, "Oh my gosh, what was my subconscious doing?"
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Picking your best friend to talk to.
  </li><li>That's fascinating.
  </li><li>But he's lovely, like he's a lovely guy
 and it was interesting to observe.
 I've only ever had bad counseling experiences.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So it was, I've realized going in, I'm like,
 "Oh, I feel a little traumatized having to go in.
 The only thing that is nice for me is I know I don't have to talk.
 So it's, you know, but it was nice to see a safe counseling environment.
 Did you feel like I was me when you were observing me?
 Sort of sort of like a more playfully combative.
 I don't know how to explain how you were.
 I was sort of like, huh, like it felt like you were trying to analyze
 everything you're doing from both sides, which I thought was his job, not yours.
 Well, that's a dynamic we run up against in part because again, sitting, analyzing your feelings is
 all sort of official. So I'm trying to ensure that I give him the most reliable data possible.
 And because I'm quite a high verbal processor, I'll say something and I'll be like, I don't know
 if I agree with that. And then I'll talk about it left, right, and center. I know it's your idea
 of torture. Yeah, this sounds horrible to me. There's nothing about this. It sounds appealing.
 Well, I love that you came and it helped me get a sense of,
 am I being myself? And I think a slightly more playfully combative version of myself is myself.
 Thank you for coming. I felt super loved. You're super welcome.
 Friday, we had a little date with the boy. We did. Yeah, we only have a couple of Fridays left
 with just the boy before it's summer and it's all the kids.
 And then he goes to school in August, which I'm just trying to pretend this is not all
 happening this August.
 I'm looking forward to it because the amount of money that we'll save in childcare is unbelievable.
 That's true.
 We're talking a lot of money.
 I'm like, wow, I've been by so many more Nintendo games.
 I know.
 It's going to be amazing.
 You're adorable.
 Thanks.
 those feelings talk about Friday where we ate tacos and ice cream.
 We did. We had tacos and ice cream. I cannot wait for Mojo's to open.
 You know, not just the truck, but the actual restaurant.
 Absolutely. Yeah.
 We also bumped into Pete Nashley from Alabama, who I love when this happens.
 I'd love when we're just planning our own business and somebody comes up and says,
 "Are you Alan A.J.?" and, "Oh, we listened to podcasts." And, of course,
 you don't know what we look like because we don't really, you can't see us. You got a photo that
 that was taken, I don't know, eight years ago.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And we need to update that for.
  </li><li>We do.
 I think I'm pretty sure I'm pregnant in that photo.
  </li><li>You are.
  </li><li>And we're really dark brown here.
 I was kind of amazed that they could recognize us
 because honestly, we both looked like we had thrown
 on old clothes and not showered.
 I didn't have any makeup on.
 I was like, I don't care.
 It's my day off.
 But I'm like, oh, great.
 We're meeting people.
  </li><li>Oh, yeah.
 I did try to warn you.
 I was like, "Hey, baby, are you fleeing your homeland?"
  </li><li>You did.
 As I was heading out the door, you're like, "Is that?
 Are you really gonna wear that?"
 And I was like, "Yeah, why wouldn't I?
 It's my day off.
 I'm not doing my hair.
 I'm not doing my makeup.
 I'm not getting dressed practically.
 I mean, I was just one step better than pajamas."
 Yeah, lesson learned.
  </li><li>Let's talk about Saturday.
 Saturday, you made me do something.
 That sounds really powerless.
  </li><li>Yes, it does.
 It sounds very powerless.
 Saturday you made plans that I was made aware of and I came with you on those plans. Yes, you did.
 But you took me to a middle school production of the Lion King. Now, what made you think that I
 would enjoy that? I didn't really care if you enjoyed it, actually. I wanted you to come and see
 the middle school that our daughter's going to be going to and get an idea of the kind of stuff
 that she's likely to get excited about because she loves singing, she loves dancing and all that kind of stuff.
 And so they had this production on and I was actually really surprised that a middle school has a
 theater auditorium like that. It's not like they're using a gym, they're using an actual...
 No, granted. It was a hundred times better than what I was expecting.
 Yeah, it was really good.
 But still, that's not how I want to spend my Saturday afternoons.
 No, but I mean, I've just thought for me, I thought, oh, I'd love Abby to get an idea of the kind of stuff that they do. So she is interested.
 She knows what she's signing up for. Does that make sense?
 The kids love it. Two millions of dreams like, okay, forget family movie nights. Can we do family theater nights? And I'm like, oh, my gosh, you're adorable.
 Yeah, MJ loved it too. They were just in Ratchet. I'd love to take them to a Broadway show.
 Yeah, they would love it. How about Wicked? Just kidding.
 Sorry.
 Does is there a Harry Potter on ice?
 I hope not.
 Yeah, that'd be good.
 Well, it really shows like that in Nashville, though.
 Is it?
 No, I was thinking about going to Broadway in New York City.
 I think that could be tremendous fun.
 Oh, my gosh, they would love that.
 You would love that.
 Oh, yeah, I would love that.
 Forget them.
 I'm just kidding.
 Yeah.
 And then Sunday, which is today.
 It is.
 I spoke at church this morning.
 you did. I asked you, I was like, Hey, babe, I just think that went. And you were like, I think
 students are used to you like poking at them. The rest of the church knows about it.
 I think they did. I think that they took it really well. I think they did remarkably well.
 You know, it's not nice when there's somebody up there at the front talking about dynamics in
 in your life that you a might not be aware is going on and be if it is going on.
 You know, it shakes you a little bit.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I was talking about the drama triangle.
 Yes.
 And the roles that we play when we feel powerless.
 Yeah, which is, you know, never a fun topic, but we made it through it.
 Well done people.
 I think I've heard you teach it maybe three times in the last couple of weeks
 because you taught it at staff or at the pastors meeting anyway.
 Yep.
 And then you briefly touched on it with year two
 and then you sort of filled it out this morning.
 But this morning was great how much
 it's actually grounded in scripture
 and just your explanations were really, really good.
 And even being able to identify,
 this is what you get out of it if you're playing this role.
 I thought was super helpful in being able to identify
 am I the victim or am I the rescuer?
 Am I the persecutor?
 So I thought that was really good.
  </li><li>You're very sweet, thank you, Dary.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I came home and-
  </li><li>Crashed.
  </li><li>Crashed, I've discovered something
 that mildly motivates me to exercise.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Wait, why are you giving that look?
  </li><li>Because I just think it's really cute.
 Like you discovered it, like, you know,
 it's never been done before.
  </li><li>I have discovered something.
 It is the key to all things exercise.
 Behold, this is my discovery.
 Ta-da.
 Go ahead and answer your discovery.
 My discovery is if I can find a show
 that I binge watch on Netflix or Hulu or whatever.
 Yeah.
 If I take the iPad downstairs and put it into the treadmill,
 instead of sitting in the bed or sitting on a sofa
 and watching it, if I just walk while I'm watching it,
 before you know it, I've done an hour of exercise.
 Yeah.
 And I invented that.
 All right, let's leave my great inventions and talk about our main topic for this week.
 We're talking about the joy of navigating transitions.
 Yeah, most people don't find that joyful.
 What I was thinking was I started just thinking, but I don't know if I'm wired to change
 you, but I love transition.
 I love change.
 Really?
 Yeah, well, it's not surprising I get bored really easily.
 So whenever change comes about, I'm really happy to say goodbye to the old and I'm really
 excited about the new. And my experience of the Lord is all the transitions he's brought
 me through have been amazing. Yes. Would you say you even enjoy the work that it takes to get
 from one to the other? I remember when we were moving house the last time. Yes. That was a lot
 of work. Yes. Now, I want to qualify that. We were helped by an astonishing number of people.
 Yes. So I am not from suggesting that I did all this work at all. But nevertheless,
 It was a lot of work because we staged our house.
 I remember our realtor came around and said, if you do what I tell you, you'll sell your
 house in the day.
 So we're like, all right, we'll do what you tell us.
 And so she said, you need to trim down your house by what?
 Like you need to get rid of a third of the stuff in your house.
 And so we got a storage unit, but actually got a couple of storage units.
 And we just moved tons of extra boxes out of the garage, you know, furniture, you know,
 we're just trying to thin down the house.
 And she was right.
 The house looked much bigger.
 But that meant tons and tons and tons of moving boxes, which I'm not a fan of manual labor
 But I remember as a moving these boxes
 I was beginning to grumble and complain and the Lord said to me
 Would you move these boxes for a hundred thousand dollars?
 And I said I absolutely would and I said great, you know, that's what you're gonna get from your selling your house
 I was like I will move these boxes for a hundred thousand dollars without grumbling
 So it's not that I enjoy the process right there and then although I'm quite a high-doer
 like, if you can just give me a task and I can get it done, I feel good. And like I said,
 I had tons of help. So there was lots of camaraderie and fun. But no, I don't necessarily enjoy that,
 but do I love living in a new house, for example? Yes. Yeah, I do. I hate the red tape that's
 associated with moving. I've got permanent residency in three different nations.
 Well, the first one was easy because I was just born into it. But the other two,
 you know, there's a lot of money. There's a lot of time involved. And I don't enjoy the process,
 but I love what it's pointing to.
 Yeah, I gotcha.
 But then I was thinking about, you've had some transition that you haven't liked.
 I'm thinking about getting divorced.
 That kind of been a fun transition.
 It was not a great transition.
 You're probably not thinking, man, I can't wait to talk about the joy of navigating this transition
 in like 20 years.
 Yeah.
 But I think my point in it is if God's in the transition, which God always is,
 because he's in your life, then he's going to redeem something.
 No?
 Yeah.
 No, I agree. I agree is interesting.
 Like just out the blue here, like out of the two husbands that you've had, you know, which one of you like the most?
 Well, I am definitely more fond of you, babe.
 Oh, okay. See? Transition. When, when?
 Oh, my gosh. Yeah. I mean, I was thinking as reading through the notes and you referenced moving nine times, you know, in your life or something like that.
 Right.
 I remember a season where I moved 14 times in three years.
 So I didn't enjoy those ones as much.
 Were you on the run?
 Yes, I was on the run from the law.
 No, I just was sort of switching jobs.
 I moved, then I went to YWAM, so then you move again, then you move back from YWAM.
 Then I found a temporary place to live until I found a permanent place to live, and then
 that place only lasted.
 You know what I mean?
 So it was like one of those things.
 So I, yeah, I moved a lot.
 I didn't enjoy that that much,
 but each place was sort of an upgrade on the next.
 So.
  </li><li>The reason I was thinking about this topic is this week,
 we lead into our graduation,
 our School of Supernatural Life students graduate.
 We can't wait to celebrate with them on Tuesday night.
 And you know, typically when we head into a week like this,
 there's just a mix of emotions.
 And one of the things I want to remind the students
 when we see them tomorrow is,
 hey, you came to the school for this moment here.
 Yes.
 The purpose of the school was to leave the school.
 Yes.
 So this is a great opportunity.
 And I think that's what I love about transition.
 I love the potential of the transition.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Each moment, whether you're graduating high school, graduating university, or graduating
 a vocational school, it's an opportunity, isn't it, to start to shape your life with the Lord
 in a certain direction.
 So it's quite exciting.
 I've been reflecting on our transition and I don't think we could have planned our life here in Franklin.
 It's filled with people we didn't know and the place we'd never been doing things we never dreamed we'd love.
 And I'm like, "All of this is orchestrated by the Lord."
 Like, congratulations Lord, round of applause, you did an awesome job.
 And for sure it all followed scary change.
 You know, whether you found it scary or not, it was a big deal to move countries.
 It was a big deal to even sign up basically to leave to ACF for what we hope this is going
 to be good.
 Right.
 I mean, what you hear about people having nightmare transitions?
 Yeah.
 Imagine if we got to Grace and her and it was, you know, Jeff is super controlling or the
 culture was horrible or they didn't value the Holy Spirit.
 I mean, there could have been so many things wrong, but the Lord went before us and it's
 been amazing.
 Yeah.
 What would you say to people who are in transition right now and they hate it?
 Well, I think I would start with my life first. Are we allowed to have life versus?
 So Romans 828 says, "For God causes all things to come together for good for those that love God
 and are called according to His purpose." And I think for me, that's been something I've hung
 on to my whole life is okay, God, like no matter even what it looks like at this moment, you
 are going to cause it to come together for good because I love you. And I'm called to
 your purpose, which is to love others, you know, so I would say if you're in the middle
 of a tough place in your new place to just keep sticking it through knowing that God
 is going to see you through.
 Right, like how did you cope? I'm trying to think about you.
 Your husband leaves.
 I'm not a rifle scene for another eight years.
 Yes.
 What, and you don't know in eight years time you're going to meet a new husband.
 No, I thought I was staying safe.
 The body of a Greek god.
 And no, I had no idea.
 Right. So what, like, what did you do with yourself in that transition?
 How did you navigate that?
 Well, I would say in my heart, I sort of went up and down.
 I'd have moments where I'd be running from God because I didn't understand how I ended up here,
 you know, here being divorced and you know, just hurting. And then I'd have other moments
 where I was like, "God, I know you're going to make it and you know, you're going to do amazing
 things." And so it was sort of riding the roller coaster until it was more ups than downs and
 pursuing healing of the heart because I realized there was a whole bunch of stuff that came to the
 the surface during that time.
 We also had amazing community around you.
 I did.
 Amazing community that I could go to and say, hey, I'm not having a good day.
 And I also had amazing community that would come to me and say, why aren't you
 being honest with how you're feeling right now?
 Hey, why aren't you letting us help you?
 And you know, that kind of stuff.
 So yeah, I had great community.
 Um, and I went to a great church and I stayed plugged in even when I was tempted
 to just go and hide somewhere.
 What do you really?
 I don't think of you as a hider.
 But that was a temptation.
 It's always a temptation to hide.
 It's always easier to hide than it is to face stuff.
 And if you think about it, like for me,
 even though that was my home church,
 I now had all these shared memories
 with my first husband where we would lead worship together
 and all this kind of stuff.
 And so it was facing people that used to be our friends,
 but now they're, he's no longer part of the equation
 for any of us, but they just felt like there was a lot of pain.
 So did you have the ability to believe God for the best that you think I know God's
 going to redeem us?
 I know God's going to redeem us.
 Or were you just managing day by day?
 I was really believing that the Lord was going to restore that marriage for the first three
 years.
 Right.
 And then I had a dream and the Lord told me I'm going to restore this a different way
 and to let him go.
 And he called the next dance that I wanted divorce and, you know, that was sort of it.
 But I would say I, in many ways, I shut down my emotions.
 Like I just sort of went, I have hope, I have hope.
 And then after a couple more years, I was like, I don't have hope anymore.
 Hope's painful.
 I'm going to shut down to hope and I am just going to power through with faith, you know.
 And so I sort of got to the place, you know, just before I met you that I was like, I'm
 going to stay single.
 I'm probably never going to have kids.
 I'm just going to work for the Lord.
 And, you know, and none of those things are bad things except that they were all
 choices made out of pain, which I couldn't really recognize at the time.
 I was going to say, how did that life plan work out?
 Yeah.
 Well, I'm glad it didn't work out to be honest with you.
 Because, you know, now I've married this man with the body of a Greek God.
 Isn't that what we just said?
 I don't like talking about it, but let's talk about my body.
 I think that one of the things I've heard Jeff say, which I really love is, you know,
 your story isn't written yet. It's not even the end of the chapter.
 And I think about, that's what I love about the Lord. He's always onward and upward.
 He's always taken us from glory to glory. The transition has to be part of that.
 And I love when the seasons change. I love, I'm not talking about in the natural,
 I of course I love when the season changed the natural because I love the outdoors now, but I'm more mean in the spirit realm
 I love when there's this growing season. I love when there's this growing anticipation of the seasons changing that God's doing something that
 Mard by upgrade and I think if I could encourage anybody who's finding the process of transition hard is to not give up
 Yeah, I think one of the things you know
 We we have this cute saying in Christendom that oh, you know, just feels like the grace is lifted. Have you heard people say that?
 Yeah. And what they mean is, oh, it's actually getting tough.
 Yeah. And I'm like, yeah, but tough isn't an indicator that the Lord's no longer in it.
 Yeah. Like if the grace is lifted, that's when character is required. Yeah.
 So I've watched, in my opinion, many people shortcut, bow out of the transition,
 I'm never getting to the next level because they quit before they saw what was coming on the horizon.
 Right. Because I think the grace lifting is actually the thing that means,
 "Oh, you can move on," rather than the thing that says, "Hey, push in,"
 because there's actually a victory on the other side of this.
 Yeah. Well, we talked about Romans 828, which made me smile because that was your email when I first met you.
 You had a Hotmail account. I can't believe that I pushed through.
 You had a Hotmail account and you were a Dell user. Clearly, you needed me in your life.
 You were a silver aeroplane member. That's true.
 I was in orange when I met you.
 (laughing)
 I wasn't silver.
 Have we told that story?
 So when I met AJ, of course,
 she'd been traveling around the world on her own for four years.
 Yes.
 And so, she was an elite frequent flyer with her calendar.
 And when I started, I hadn't flown anywhere.
 So I got the website and I sign up and I'm an orange,
 which is basically nothing.
 And then I think by the time we got married,
 I had accumulated enough miles to get silver.
 And I think one of our early trips when we checked in together,
 the, you know, the checking agent, just, and so I would ride on your goodness.
 Like as a Sylvia weren't allowed into airport lounges,
 she weren't eligible for any upgrades.
 But you would be my tag of, like, I would be your plus one.
 So wherever we'd go, you know, you would get me into the priority check in lane.
 You get me through security.
 You know, we'd go sit in the lounge and when we go in, I really miss those days.
 I still have all our cards, by the way.
 And when we go in, I remember this.
 I have no doubt that you do.
 remember this lady at the Maple Leaf Lounge, the air counter frequent flyer lounge.
 She checked us both in and she looked at our names and she looked at my card, she looked at your card and she looked at you and she said,
 you married a silver.
 And she literally, and I was like, hey, it really sounded confused.
 Silver, silver people have feelings too.
 Yeah, it was funny. Yeah. So there you go. I may have had a Dell, but I married a silver.
 Yeah. All right. These are the Lord so good at redeeming both things in our lives.
  </li><li>They don't need them.
  </li><li>So we've got, I was thinking about a list of things
 that would be helpful for people in transition.
 You talked about the goodness of God, Romans 8 28.
 I talked about when the grace lifts.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>What else we want to talk about?
 Oh, that whole thing of, if it's hard,
 you've got to, like Jeff says,
 you know, the book isn't written yet.
 You've got to trust that in hindsight, everything makes sense.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like God's in it.
 So wherever you are, if you're on your own
 transitioning. If you are transitioning from one job to another, if you're moving house,
 if you're feeling lost, know that you're in the right place at the right time, that the hand of
 the Lord is upon you. And this is the season that's going to bring about amazingness. But it just
 takes hindsight for a proper perspective to happen.
 Yeah. I think I get what you're saying about being excited about change now. I would say,
 When the Lord brings change now, I understand that it's for upgrade.
 I didn't feel that way before because I didn't fully understand how good he was.
 Yeah, I think that's really interesting. You say that. I just think that my modern history with the
 Lord, it feels like, I don't know if this is right, it feels like there was a season of my life where
 all I went through was an opportunity to sacrifice. Yeah. And that lasted many years.
 And once that season happened, I feel like all I've had is reward. Like if you think about it, I
 even going so just even to change a career going from being a computer techno kid to a school teacher
 was sacrifice of sacrifice of all my dreams. And I don't want to labor this because I'm not trying
 I'm like, my sacrifice is nothing.
 You know, I'm a white middle class person
 who lives in luxury.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know, there's really no sacrifice,
 but at the time it cost me everything I had.
 So, you know, I sacrificed those dreams
 and then I go be a school teacher
 and I thought that's what I was gonna do
 for the rest of my life.
 And then the Lord invites me to Toronto
 and on the one hand, I sell everything I had.
 And honestly, I didn't have much to sell,
 but I sold everything I had
 and I moved to Toronto to live in a warehouse.
 That wasn't sacrifice for me.
 That was delight.
 Like kidding me, that's all I ever wanted to do was come to Toronto.
 But then once I go to Toronto, it just feels like I've been on this onward,
 an upward cycle of favor.
 Like I don't see sacrificing anything we've ever done.
 It's all been reward, wouldn't you say?
 I think that's an interesting hindsight perspective, but I think we've definitely
 experienced the sacrifice end of some things.
 I'm I'm racking my brain trying to think I feel like everything is being utter reward.
 I feel like everything we have today is is is just glorious.
 I do think everything we have today is glorious.
 I'm just thinking like, you know, when we talk about, hey, when it gets hard in the
 grace lifts, does that necessarily mean that you move?
 Like when we the first year that we were here, it was really hard, babe.
 I mean, I don't know if you remember, but there was times we didn't have food.
 So of course, selective memory.
 You really do because I'm like, dude, I mean, the first year that we were here,
 I needed to know that we had heard from the Lord because the people were amazing,
 you know, but just other circumstances were difficult.
 And, you know, we rented a house that had spiders and, you know, there was all kinds of stuff that I was like, oh,
 just brand recluse spiders, babe.
 I know. No big deal. No big deal.
 So I think, I think, yeah, when you look back overall, yeah, no big deal, no big sacrifice.
 But in the moment, some seasons were pretty tough.
 Grim Cook has these brilliant questions.
 He says that whenever you're in a season of life that you don't understand, the two best
 questions to ask is, what does this mean and what must I do?
 Right.
 So whenever you're facing change, whenever you're facing conflict, whenever you're facing
 transition, you get to ask, Lord, what does this mean for our relationship? Lord, who are you trying
 to be in this season? Who are you wanting to be for me in this season that you couldn't be in any
 other? And what must I do from my end for our relationship? What is it you want me to think? How
 do you want me to approach you? And I think those two questions are marvelous. One of the questions
 that's never helpful is the why question. Why is this happening to me? The why question is rarely
 answered this side of eternity. But I found tremendous comfort in praying through those
 questions of like, "Okay, Lord, what does this mean?" So when you think about those
 seasons that were hard and you think about what did that mean for your relationship with
 the Lord, what do you see now?
 Well, I see that even though there was scary moments, God came through in spades time and
 time and time again. And I think I thought, you know, we had moved from living by faith
 with which I was really comfortable with, to having a salary, which I think then I thought,
 oh, well, we removed God from the equation once we have a salary, but we needed God in
 the equation to make it. Does that make sense? Yeah. And so I would say the first year of
 being here was learning a lesson of it doesn't matter if you have a salary or not, you need
 God in the equation still, and that he's still there to answer.
 So yeah, I mean, I would say we probably learned a lot during that season if, you know, think
 I learned a lot about who I am and who you are, like who we are as people in terms of,
 you know, that first year we're launching M&amp;A, we're starting to dream about the school.
 And for the first time in our married lives, we're envisioning building a ministry as opposed
 to just traveling.
 And so you get to take stock of Lord, what have you put in me that's to give away?
 So I think it was a great season of first, a great first year, a couple of first years
 here of learning what's in us to give away and what has God put in us to build something
 different.
 chuckling over here because I guess I really am just a forward looking person.
 You know, I, when you say that stuff and I think, oh yeah, I forgot about that.
 Oh, yeah. No, no, I remember. I remember that. Oh, yeah. Like, but don't you remember the day
 that we were like Becky and Jeff had called us and said, Hey, do you want to come over to the house?
 And I had just finished texting you and saying, okay, I fed the kids, but there's no food left for us.
 and then came over to Becky and Jeff's house and Becky said,
 "The Lord told me to give you this."
 And it was like, I don't even remember $40.
 And I started crying because I was like,
 "We can buy groceries."
 You know, I was so excited.
  </li><li>I remember that.
  </li><li>And then somebody paid off our minivan.
  </li><li>The same night.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, I just, I don't know, I think the miracle's
 overshadows the misery.
  </li><li>Maybe I have the mom perspective
 of looking in the cupboard and going, "Well."
 (laughs)
 I want to be careful because like, you know, we live such an amazing life.
 I don't want to ever paint it.
 Like I just used the word misery there.
 We don't know misery.
 No.
 And but anyway, yeah, I am, I am giggling to myself that I'm my perspective is somewhat skewed.
 I think just always forward, always, always excited.
 Do you think that's true?
 Well, I, I do.
 Yeah.
 I just think like, and I, when I'm, I'm trying to think from the perspective of
 listeners who are having a hard time or have stepped out for the Lord.
 And I know we say stuff like, Hey, if God asks you to do it, then he writes the
 checks. He does. But sometimes they come right at the last second.
 Do you know what I mean?
 And so I just didn't want to leave people with their perspective of when you follow
 God, it's all hunky dory and roses and nothing's ever challenging.
 And therefore you can just back out if things get challenging.
 I don't think that's it. I think sometimes things are challenging.
 Oh yeah.
 And it's a matter of just going, okay, Lord,
 this is what I heard you say.
 I haven't heard anything different.
 So I'm gonna keep being faithful in the midst of this
 and trust that you're gonna meet me here.
 And I think that's what we did.
 And again, it was a short season
 in terms of the span of our lives
 or even the span of amount of time we've been here
 that was difficult like that.
 But I think I learned to stick through something
 even though it might have been easier to run.
 Right. I'm now remembering some of those events.
 I'm remembering arriving in the United States with a social security number that's
 like five days old.
 Yeah.
 So you don't exist in any credit bureau.
 Right.
 So trying to get utilities turned on in your house.
 Do you remember that?
 Right.
 And, and so just, yeah, like all the things that were everything was
 seemed impossible.
 Yeah. It was like pushing water uphill with a rake.
 I mean, it was just like, oh, wow, this is so hard.
 And then we had a baby and then we had a baby.
 And we're like, how much does that cost?
 28,000 dollars.
 We're like, okay, so where's that money coming from?
 I'm putting me.
 I thought we had health insurance.
 How does this work?
 Yeah.
 I mean, it was a shocking year.
 Good.
 All right.
 Well, if you're in transition, we're not trying to press you.
 We're trying to say, listen, we get it that it's hard.
 God is good.
 And he's so good.
 And in a number of years, you'll be looking back on this event.
 And maybe you'll have forgotten about it like me.
 Or maybe like AJ you'll have remembered it, but the kindness of the Lord will just soften the sting of what you're feeling today.
 Yeah.
 If the Lord is anyone like I know he is.
 And so that's what we pray for you.
 Yeah.
 So wherever you are, whatever you're doing, whatever transition you're facing in your life, we bless you today to be encouraged to press through, to continue to not give up, to not withdraw, to understand that you're called to go from glory to glory.
 and you have to believe that this is part of your journey
 to the next level of God's goodness in your life.
  </li><li>Yeah.
