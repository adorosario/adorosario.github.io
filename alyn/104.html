<p> I live in a j's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Good evening, Mr. Jones.<br/>
 Good evening, Mrs. Jones.<br/>
 You look fantastic.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 As most people who listen to podcasts know, we've been on this weight loss program.
 Yes.<br/>
 And what's funny is it feels like in the last two days, I've had more comments about our weight loss than since February.
 Yeah, I've had a lot of comments as well.
 this. But it feels like in the last five days, we must have lost a dramatic amount of weight
 based on people's reactions. Yeah, or maybe we're just, I mean, as you said to me on Friday, babe,
 you're wearing big baggy clothing and you've lost almost 40 pounds. Could you change?
 Well, let's not tell the world that's my wife. I'm sure I said to slide them more
 delicate later than that. Yes, you did. You said it nicer than that.
 Yeah. But it was a good point. It was a good point.
 I put on my new skin jeans and voila all of a sudden people noticed that I've lost some way to
 voila is a very good way of describing my reaction and then of course I shaved you did and so I guess I now look baby face
 out you look like a pup very cute my pup yeah your pup let's right keep wearing those jeans and I'll be
 anything you want me to be you know what you know I completely forgot to do last week we better go
 You know, I completely forgot to do last week.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I forgot to say congrats to Kazaya or Kaz.
 She was the person that won the hundred dollars from the feedback.
 So we went through the whole thing about summarizing our feedback and what we'd
 learned and we actually forgot to congratulate the winner.
 Sorry about that.<br/>
 So sorry.<br/>
 I wanted to do that.<br/>
 And some people want some books and stuff to do, didn't they?
 Yeah, we didn't just want to do one winner.
 So there was a bunch of runner up prizes as well.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Let's catch up on our week because we've got a lot to talk about.
 OK.<br/>
 Give us an update on the band book printing,
 Palava.<br/>
 That was lovely.<br/>
 The printing, Palava.<br/>
 Well, the printing, Palava has been escalated up the food chain as it were.
 So I'm now waiting to hear back from a supervisor.
 Very good.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 Apologies again to people who are trying to order them,
 we're trying to resolve the printing issue as quickly as possible.
 Yes.<br/>
 Can I talk about going to the dentist?
 You sure can.<br/>
 I mean, I'm sure everybody wants to hear about the dentist.
 Well, you will when you want to hear me on nitrous oxide.
 So I haven't ever had nitrous oxide.<br/>
 I don't think it's laughing gas.<br/>
 So I get there and they're going to be doing about two and a half hours of dental work.
 They're going to be drilling into some teeth, removing fillings, taking molds.
 And I'm getting, I think they're called on lays, I guess, are partial crowns.
 He just said, sir, you've got so many fillings that if we remove them, we'll be
 surprised if you have any tooth left.<br/>
 So I was every two and a half hours.<br/>
 And I didn't sleep much the night before because I was working very hard on a bunch of stuff with more conference.
 And so I said, guys, I'm super tired.<br/>
 Do you mind if I just fall asleep?<br/>
 And they were like, no, not at all.<br/>
 So they have this little, you know, when you take your car into the mechanic, they have a jack that lifts up the car.
 Yes.<br/>
 Well, they have a jack they put in your mouth.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And then I guess they just turned up the nitrous oxide and I fell asleep while they were drilling in my mouth.
 I could have gotten valuable information out of you.
 I've been there.<br/>
 But the worst thing that happened is I woke up or maybe not woke up.
 I kind of came to at some point, but I was as dizzy as it all could be.
 So I'm trying to communicate to them that I'm dizzy, but of course I've got this
 dental jack in my mouth.<br/>
 So they eventually take it out.<br/>
 They, they filtered down, but for about two and a half hours, I floated my way through
 Um, being drilled pieces.<br/>
 I don't like that stuff.<br/>
 I, I, uh, well, it makes your feet feel heavy.
 Well, I don't think I'd breathe it for long enough to know that.
 I just didn't like that.<br/>
 It made you feel dizzy at all.<br/>
 So I think I breathe it for all of about two or three minutes and went, yeah,
 I'm going to do it without this.<br/>
 He said I was a lightweight.<br/>
 They said, we only started you on what the average human, you know, manages and we have to lower you down to a one.
 So like toddler level.<br/>
 Complete at the level, but I guess that's a lightweight and I just, oh, you're so cute.
 You like weight.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 Meanwhile, we've been potty training the last child.
 It is so glorious.<br/>
 It's a chance with me.<br/>
 No more diapers, no more diapers.<br/>
 No more.<br/>
 He's been quite good.<br/>
 He's been great.<br/>
 He's had like one accident since we started.
 That's right.<br/>
 And we have, believe it or not, a video produced by Sesame Street called "Almos Party Time,"
 which talks about all the delicacies of peeing and pooing, which he loves to say, "Axtons
 Happen," which is an in one of these songs.
 Yes.<br/>
 But the one accident that he actually almost broke into song over wasn't an accident,
 because he said, "Well, I'm still wearing my pull-up, and so I'm allowed to poop in a pull-up."
 So that wasn't an accident.<br/>
 That wasn't intentional pooping.<br/>
 Yes, but the one in a Superman underwear that was an accident.
 That was gross.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Do you want to talk about anything else that happened this week?
 Oh, we bought a house.<br/>
 Well, yeah, I guess we did.<br/>
 Well, we put in a contract on a house.
 We haven't technically bought it yet.<br/>
 True.<br/>
 We just have to sell our house before.
 Yeah, no big deal.<br/>
 You had a proof for financing.<br/>
 You know, there's a bunch of contingencies in there, but.
 But yes, we decided to move.<br/>
 Which is strange because we love our house.
 We do love our house, but we can see how with the kids getting bigger and
 separating Abby and Tia into separate rooms because of their ages and Abby
 being therefore able to stay up later and stuff.
 It was just a we're going to run out of room real fast because of course we use
 the bonus room or what would have been a playroom as a podcast studio.
 We do.<br/>
 So so pray for us this week.<br/>
 If you think about it, we're putting our house on the market on Friday,
 which means between now and Friday, we've got an awful lot to do.
 Oh, you have so much to do.<br/>
 You might want to declutter your house.
 So we're doing all that this weekend.<br/>
 We're praying for a bidding war on our house.
 That's the way we like it.<br/>
 Our big news, of course, though, we just finished the more conference.
 We did.<br/>
 And what a conference it was.<br/>
 It was so good.<br/>
 And so our main topic this week is I thought it would be fun to talk through the highlights
 of each of the sessions that Danny did at the more conference.
 OK.<br/>
 So we had a conference here at Grace Anderson Annual Conference happens every year so far for the last five years, six years, something like that.
 And this year's speaker was Danny Silk from Jesus Culture, I guess Bethel Church is where he's most known to be, actually lives in Sacramento now.
 And Chris McLawney was in leading worship.
 Both of them just did a phenomenal job.
 Yeah, it was really, really good.<br/>
 And Danny taught four sessions at the conference plus two extra sessions on a Sunday morning, which was a real thrill.
 Yeah, it was awesome.<br/>
 So we got six sessions.<br/>
 We got six sessions.<br/>
 Do you remember what he talked about on Friday night?
 Yes, on Friday night, he spoke on connections.
 Give us a brief synopsis of the importance of connection when it comes to relationships.
 Yeah, he was talking about the value of connection over, for example, being right.
 It made me think of Jeff's statement that he makes.
 Would you rather be right or have relationship?
 I'd rather be both.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 But it doesn't usually work out like that.
 That's right.<br/>
 So essentially was sort of talking about the kind of stuff that we've also heard from Chip
 Judd and stuff like that about marriage. It wasn't only speaking about marriage,
 it was talking about all kinds of relationships. But the marriage is really about who can out
 serve one another. There was a lot in his discussion about
 valuing, maintaining connection over, yeah, needing to be right or needing to have the
 last word or that kind of thing.<br/>
 Yeah, I love the points he made about the importance of connection and how if we're not
 careful in our relationship, not just marriage relationships, we, we start off in our relationships,
 prioritizing connection with another person, finding that spark that delight in having a
 relationship. But we don't realize that that took effort. And if we're not careful, we can lull
 ourselves into thinking we have what we had, but we haven't preserved or maintained the connection.
 Right. And that's when you end up falling out of love. Yeah. He told some humor stories from his
 years of course counseling. Yeah. That were really hard hitting. I was like, oh, he's a phenomenal
 teacher.<br/>
 Yes, he's a very gifted communicator for sure.
 And he uses slides, so you know we're going to like him.
 He uses videos, so you know we're going to like him even more.
 What was funny is we've almost got a podcast episode for every session he taught on.
 So we recorded a podcast episode all about connection.
 If you want to hear more about that in depth, go to ln&amp;ag.com/69 and you can listen to that
 podcast about connection.<br/>
 Saturday morning, he talked all about how to preserve and strengthen that connection
 using love languages. Which the danger is you're like, "Oh, I've already heard love
 languages. I don't need to hear this." But he gave a description of them that I hadn't
 heard before. What was that?<br/>
 That really clarified things. Well, what was really helpful and you're going to laugh
 because you are a very high quality time person was he was explaining. I think part of the
 dynamic that I've had is it doesn't feel integrous for me to pretend to be interested
 something I'm not. And he managed to clear up that misconception. It's not that you care about
 what they're saying. You're caring about the person who the words are coming out of.
 And I was like, oh, that makes so much more sense. Because when you have kids, you have plenty of
 opportunity to practice being interested in something that you have no interest in.
 Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Everything they talk about.
 That was his example, wasn't it? We were like, oh, we can totally relate. They get off the bus,
 and they're talking about the boy that you threw through the this and that. And you're just like,
 You're still talking and i don't know who these people are but you know the importance of being heard.
 He had some examples about my what am i am physical time and quality touch.
 I'm sure i don't think that's right baby no i also like to stuff about gifts which of course is your either your first or your second my first is actually acts of service can you know i know you so well some believe.
 But don't they change, don't you?<br/>
 No, I, I, uh, it's the same three that are within like, I think they were like 11, 11 and 10.
 Right.<br/>
 And so it was, uh, but it's acts of service and then quality time and then guess.
 Access service, quality time and then.
 And then I have almost no need whatsoever for affirmation, words of affirmation or touch.
 I've noticed both those things.<br/>
 And then there's you who's words of affirmation and touch.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Are you your number ones?<br/>
 But I'm fairly adept at making my needs known.
 Yes, you are.<br/>
 You may have noticed that.<br/>
 I have experienced that.<br/>
 Yeah, I wrote myself a letter because you sign it.
 It basically tells me how awesome I am.
 It tells me I'm amazing.<br/>
 Could you just like kiss it or something?
 But the other revelation that I had heard before, but I'd forgotten.
 And I think the way he explained it was so good was all of us have different
 drain rates of our.<br/>
 Oh, yeah.<br/>
 That was so good.<br/>
 Yeah. And so even if you're not, for example, you're not a physical touch person, right,
 or you're not a high words of affirmation. No. But if you don't get words of affirmation,
 which is fairly rare because I'm constantly speaking at you with positive tones. But if you
 don't get a consistent amount of positive feedback, you can tell that your love tank
 drains in that area. Yeah, but the whole idea was he was saying the ones that are your primary
 languages drain a lot faster than your other languages. Right. So that to me made so much sense
 because I thought I do want words of affirmation. I do want encouragement and I do want touch,
 but they're not the primary ways that I experience love. Right. So that made a lot of sense to me.
 Also, we've come to realize that if you take care of the primary needs, the other needs that aren't
 "as important" come online a lot faster.
 Yeah. I also had a moment where when he was talking, he was using the example of the teenager that
 comes home and is talking about youth group and what happened at school and this boy and this,
 you know, blah, blah. I actually started tearing up because I started having all these memories.
 That was something my dad did really well when I lived with him is shut off the TV,
 give me eye contact and let me talk for however long I wanted to about whatever drama I was
 experiencing, you know, at youth group or at school or whatever and he didn't rush me,
 he didn't cut me off or anything like that. And he would, like, if I got really excited,
 he would get excited with me, he would cry with me, you know, he was really great at that and I
 I didn't really think about it until Danny was talking.
 And so I kind of had a moment where I teared up a bit,
 just like, oh, my dad was really good at that.
 It's nice to be able to celebrate that about him.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah.
 It's hard to listen to that and not then evaluate yourself,
 especially if you've got kids.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But it was funny because obviously Abigail
 is high quality time.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like all she wants to do is share her heart with you
 all of the time.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Which is amazing.
 She has changed.
 She's very, very high physical touch now.
 She's very low quality time.
 She was all over you at a during church.
 Well, that's what the day it was.
 It was so crazy today.
 She didn't want to go to kids' church and she just wanted to...
 She literally cuddled me for an hour and then just sat next to me and laughed as Danny preached.
 I said, "George and I," and I was like, "because she said, 'Mommy, I haven't had a cuddle
 all day, so we laid in bed and had a little cuddle.'
 And I said, 'Well, I tried to get a cuddle at church today, but you wouldn't get off
 of daddy's laugh and she goes, "Well, I didn't want to hurt his feelings, so I just decided
 to stay with daddy."
 I was like, "Okay, he probably could have used the circulation of having you move somewhere
 else, but you're cute."
 True that.
 So cute.
 The final revelation, unless you've got one on love languages, he was explaining gifts,
 which has been an enigma to me.
 Not an enigma.
 Well, yeah, an enigma.
 one of the things he was saying is it doesn't have to be an expensive gift and I thought he hasn't met you.
 Well that's not true it doesn't have to be an expensive gift as long as it says I know you.
 So just a random gift, whether expensive or not expensive doesn't meet the mark for a gift's
 love language. It has to be a gift that says I know I knew you well enough to think of this.
 Can you think of a gift i bought you that hasn't been expensive that's told you i know you i mean probably not at the top of my head i can't that's right because all the gifts that let you know that i know you tend to be fairly expensive which isn't a criticism because.
 Anybody looks at my amazon wishlist will see we both have fairly expensive days right i mean like i've.
 Somebody's come back from the UK and just giving me a bag of minstrels.
 But because minstrels is my favorite chocolate, that to me is a great gift.
 Where if somebody were just give me, um, well, no, I like dairy milk too.
 If somebody were to give me, I don't know what you like, like milk bottles.
 I would be like, Oh, thanks, but it doesn't hit anything for me because it
 doesn't say you know me.
 Right.
 Does that make sense?
 But it was funny too, because he said about cash.
 She's like, "Don't give gifts, people cash or gift cards."
 And I'm like, and I'm looking over it to other friends of mine
 who are also gift people and they're like,
 "No, give us gift cards."
 Like to me, if somebody gets me a Williams and Sonoma gift card
 that says, "You know me and I get to go spend it on what I want."
 That's awesome.
 It's like a double, you know, not whammy,
 but you know what I mean.
  </li><li>Double bonus. - Yeah.
  </li><li>If you wanna hear us expound more on Love Languages,
 We actually recorded episode 74.
 It's all about love languages.
 Again, go to alanadio.com/74.
  </li><li>I think it's really funny that we've recorded those.
 I hadn't thought of it.
  </li><li>Yeah, we've covered quite a bit of ground.
  </li><li>Well, we've been talking a lot.
  </li><li>I think what I loved, especially about having Danny,
 is one getting to meet him,
 I don't think I'd met Danny before.
 Maybe I'd met him in passing at a conference
 when he was in Toronto,
 but I hadn't got any sit-down time with him.
 I loved listening to his teaching.
 I thought he was an excellent communicator,
 but he's also a lovely person.
  </li><li>Yeah, he's just a lovely man.
  </li><li>And he's got a wealth of wisdom,
 especially about government.
 And I gotta just throw a few questions at him.
 And say, "Hey, I was wondering about this.
 "I was thinking about this."
 And I really appreciated the insights
 and the wisdom that he gave.
 But I think, especially for me seeing
 as some of these messages, messages that we've carried
 for a long, long time,
 it's nice to hear somebody else championing things
 that are so close to my heart,
 who has greater authority.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And--
  </li><li>Makes you feel like less of a weirdo.
 It does. Well, I tweeted out last night, listening to Danny Silk makes me feel normal,
 because there's times, especially when you're bringing new concepts to a new community,
 the first pass is full of misunderstandings. So you're saying X, no, no. Yeah, but you
 said Y, yeah, but, and I remember, I remember the first time I heard teaching on boundaries.
 I remember the first time I heard teaching on, it didn't make any sense because it was
 so countercultural. So I think listening to a skilled practitioner of not only the topic,
 but the teaching explained things that are super close to my heart and value to my community
 was just wonderful. And to watch people's reaction be like, "Oh, this is amazing. We love this.
 This makes so much sense." So that was a kiss from God for me this weekend.
 Yeah, very cool.
 Saturday afternoon, Danny did question and answers. I loved what he did. He has an app,
 and you can submit your questions via an app.
 And I was like, okay, we need that for question.
 And that's a time.
 That is super clever.
 And then you don't end up with all the strange questions either.
 Oh, yeah.
 We've had some doozies.
 Yeah.
 But so I loved it.
 But before we did the question, as you talked about,
 this distinction between being a powerful person
 and being a powerless person.
 Right.
 And unless you clarify those terms,
 they sound fairly obnoxious terms or very divisive terms.
 And to be sure the terms we use all the time.
 But I understand how if you don't understand what he's meaning by that, it's offensive.
 Yeah, it can be it can be offensive.
 So a powerful person is somebody who takes full responsibility for the quality of life that they're living.
 Yes, they understand that they're in charge of their reaction, that the only person they can manage in life is themselves.
 And they're not looking to blame other people for the quality of relationships are in.
 Right.
 Conversely, a powerless person is embraced a victim mindset has no real grasp of their
 own sense of power.
 Yeah, they're outsourcing responsibility for their lives.
 Oh, all the time.
 Yeah.
 I thought obviously he explained that really, really well.
 But I think for me, the piesta resistance of the whole weekend was Saturday night when
 he talked about boundaries.
 Yeah, it was amazing.
 he came at it from an angle or a lens looking at some of the passages in scripture I had
 never considered as demonstrations of boundaries and they were profound.
 Yeah, really, really good.
 Yeah.
 So I'm going to switch over to my notes.
 I took a bunch of notes when I was teaching on boundaries.
 One of the things I thought was brilliant is he said, you know, there is no end to the
 problems of others that you may have a solution for.
 So you better find a way real fast to help maintain priorities in your life, or actually
 you will be a victim of other people's demands.
 Right.
 Actually, let me quote what he said, because I paraphrase that, and it was way more powerful
 when he said it.
 He said, "If you don't have boundaries, you're just the recipient of what other people
 want to take from you."
 Wow.
 Yeah.
 He's like basically you're subject to the whims of other people.
 Right.
 If you haven't learned to say no.
 Yeah.
 He went through scripture just breaking down examples of boundaries at work.
 So, for example, in Luke chapter 8, he read this passage in Luke chapter 8 verse 40 to
 42, where we know that Jesus has got this amazing healing ministry that every single
 person that he's prayed for has been healed.
 And there is a crowd of people who are wanting to touch Jesus, who are wanting to touch from
 him who are wanting a healing and somehow Jairus gets to the front of the queue and says,
 "Would you heal my daughter?"
 And so the passage says that Jesus left to follow Jairus and the crowd were pressing
 in against him.
 Right.
 And Danny's point was for Jesus to say yes to going with Jairus, he had to say no to all
 the other people who were wanting something from him.
 Right.
 And I never considered that in the narrative.
 Right.
 So good.
 Yeah, it was, well, it backs up the whole thing that Jesus said, you know, the sun can do
 nothing of himself, only what he sees his father doing.
 And so I just loved him unpacking that.
 And of course, along the way, this is where the woman with the issue of blood touches
 him and draws up the anointing from him.
 What about Jesus walking on the water?
 In the passage, and I think which God's believe read from, he was saying that Jesus was going
 to pass them by.
 Yeah, they're in distress.
 They're in distress.
 Yeah, they're these thorough fishermen at work, struggling with the waves and he was just going to pass them by.
 Yeah. I know so many pastors that would be totally distressed at the thought.
 Like if somebody's in distress, you need to jump in their boat with them and help them fix them.
 Yeah. That actually made me think about the statement you just made a second ago about a powerless person,
 then you're just, how did you say it? You're just open to whatever somebody wants to take from you?
 Well, yeah, I'm calling Danny. He said, if you don't have boundaries, you're just a recipient of what other people want to take.
 Right. So my thought was, if you don't have boundaries and you're the parent in a household or the head of a household,
 then actually your whole family are the recipients of anything anybody wants to take from your whole family.
 That's right. Your kids aren't safe. You know, nobody's safe because somebody can come eat you for lunch.
 Right well it's also if i'm so busy saying yes to the needs of random people right then you're saying no to your own two comes of the expense of me being with my kids right and i think one of the reasons we love our life.
 One of the reasons that we've.
 Enjoy our jobs is we have a revelation of how much we're loved which empowers us to say no really really easily without squirming without excuse to actually be able to prioritize.
 that which is most important to us while still getting our job done.
 Yeah.
 And yeah, I am so grateful for the message of boundaries.
 I think one of the greatest examples I'd heard which I'd never considered it was the healing of blind Bartimaeus.
 I love the whole way he did that, the whole story.
 He said, "I'm going to ruin it." He said, "What hurt to me is so blind his first name was blind."
 It was awesome.
 But anyway, his point was, here's this blind man.
 We already know Jesus has got a hundred percent track record and healing blind eyes.
 And the blind man calls to Jesus and says, son of David, do not pass me by.
 And Jesus says to him, what do you want me to do for you?
 And Danny's point was that the Lord will not violate your boundaries, your boundaries
 are where you end and other people begin or where other people end and you begin.
 And Jesus didn't automatically just jump across his boundary line and just say,
 "Oh, you want your sight?"
 He said, "What is it that you want?"
 And I thought, "Oh, that's...
 That explains so much about walking with God that you don't have because you don't ask."
 Right.
 Because, you know, I've heard people, in fact, I've had conversations with people who say,
 "I don't have the testimonies that you have."
 And I think some of it is people think that some of what the Lord has done for us over the years is just because God's this benevolent benefactor and somehow he's got favorites and we just happen to pull the spiritual lottery.
 So he sprinkles happy joy dust on us.
 When actually the opposite is true, he's no respecter of persons.
 So what he's done for one, he'll do for another.
 But usually when I find people saying, I don't have testimonies like yours.
 As my first question is, have you asked for testimonies like those?
 Right.
 Like, have you asked for those experiences?
 And the second thing I ask is, have you built an expectation in your life for those
 experiences?
 Right.
 Because actually God's looking for open spaces to land on.
 And he's actually inquiring of you.
 What is it you want me to do for you?
 Which, you know, is a radical concept.
 So thinking about boundaries from that side, I was like, God, I'm just getting this
 other download about your heart and your revelation. He talked about the, and he had some brilliant
 videos for these, but he talked about, well, let me quote him because he, again, he said this thing.
 He said, you don't control the other side of a boundary. He talked a little bit about what
 happens when you set a boundary. And the reason that we're often reluctant to set a boundary is
 how the other person will react. Right. And he just distilled our one hour teaching on how to set
 boundaries into you actually can't control the other side of a boundary. So don't let that be...
 The reason you don't set it.
 Right.
 I thought it was interesting. He talked about how anger, being angry, is not a boundary,
 it's just an overreaction.
 Yeah, that was really good.
 Because what most powerless people do is when they experience somebody who is
 violating one of their boundaries, taking them for granted, for example, or abusing them in some
 level of the relationship. They said, we'll use anger to defend themselves. We'll just rage.
 The reason that's not helpful is once the anger subsides, the boundary vanishes.
 We usually go and say, "I shouldn't have, I think I'll react to the shouldn't be.
 And actually, no boundary was ever put there. And so the person's learned to realize,
 "Oh, you didn't mean what you said. You just fleshed out. So now I can come back and
 you've never set limits for me. So I can plunder your resources."
 The last thing i want to add about the boundary thing was he said boundaries are something that keeps in your life what you want in your life.
 And equally something that keeps out of your life that which you don't want in your life right and use the example of the toddler in the dog didn't right you said yeah you know if you have a toddler.
 you're going to put up a fence to prevent your toddler walking out of your life and onto a row
 and hitting it. He said, "But the benefit of that fence that you've put up doesn't just keep the
 toddler in, but it also keeps the neighbors wrought while out." I thought, "Oh, gosh, that's really,
 really, really good." I think it's one of the things that I would encourage anybody in ministry
 or that knows that they're a high responder to get our boundaries teaching and just sort of work
 through that because when we used to travel, you know, we spent eight years traveling full-time
 going to many, many churches and saw a lot of pastors that were trying to jump into everybody's
 boat because they thought that's what they had to do because they were pastors or because
 they were responders or because this is what you do when you love people.
 And they were paying the price, their family was paying the price, they were exhausted,
 They don't want to be in ministry anymore.
 And a lot of that could be avoided with an understanding
 of boundaries.
 So yeah, if that's you,
 I would encourage you to just check that out
 and download it or whatever and start to work that through
 with the Lord because I think it will be life to you.
  </li><li>And if you'd like a sampler
 or you want more information about boundaries,
 shock, we recorded a podcast episode about boundaries.
  </li><li>Of course we did.
  </li><li>Yeah, go to allen and AJ.com/25 to listen to that episode.
 Now, not only was Danny with us for the whole weekend for the conference, but he also stayed over spoke on Sunday morning at Gray Center.
 Yeah.
 And I should note, we can't provide any links on the show notes to the stream of the conference because we didn't record them.
 Yeah.
 But what we did do is we did record our Sunday services and output links on the show notes so you can watch both those messages.
 Oh, great.
 Both were incredible.
 A.J.
 Talk about the messages that Danny spoke on Sunday morning.
 Well, the first service he spoke on making a room for more of God in your life.
 And it was excellent.
 It was just really good and really encouraging.
 And he was talking about, I mean, he talked through David and Saul and basically what it looks like
 in the moment isn't necessarily what it's going to look like in the end, if you're just staying the process.
 Right.
 He was, he was encouraging.
 Well, he spoke at, I think of Isaiah 54, wasn't it, about single-baron woman?
 Yeah.
 And then in a larger tent, and he said, "How cruel is it to tell somebody who wants children
 that doesn't have children to rejoice?"
 And not only that, but actually prepare their accommodation for more children.
 Right.
 And he said, "But actually, the kindness of God is that He's doing something now and preparing
 you for your future."
 Yeah.
 And the danger is that we disqualify our future by grumbling about our present.
 Right.
 do what needs to be done today for tomorrow to look like how God wants it to look.
 It was so good. It was so full of richness and encouragement that I'm going to go download
 it and I'm going to listen to it again because I think there was some sauce on it for everyone,
 but especially for us, I'm just being selfish here thinking I want to listen to it again.
 It's really good. And his point was that we don't determine what grows, we just determine
 whether we sow or not. Because what you sow today is storing up a dividend for what you're
 going to reap later in life. And often there's limited correlation in our earthly view between
 what we're doing now and what we're going to do later. It was also talking about in the same
 message about how our dreams are too small. And God is so good at having larger dreams for us.
 Yeah, it's really good.
 So are you willing to trade the dreams that you have now, betting against the dreams that God
  </li><li>That was funny, that was one of the things
 that I thought of, I can't remember sometimes Saturday
 when I was MCing and I was just during worship
 and I felt like, I can't remember what song
 we were even singing, but basically it was talking
 about how God kind of blows you away with his goodness
 and I remember thinking, gosh, like, if I'm so glad
 I didn't end up with the best I could have imagined
 for my life when I was 20.
  </li><li>'Cause it didn't include us, hunky Scotsman.
  </li><li>It didn't include a hunky Scotsman or Franklin, Tennessee,
 or being in full-time ministry or podcast,
 or any of the things that are such life to me that I love,
 the best I could hope for was like,
 oh, I'm just gonna continue to be a professional photographer
 and maybe I'll have my own studio one day.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so I look back on that and I just think,
 God, I'm so glad that you're smarter than I am
 and I'm so glad that you don't give up people
 when we give up.
  </li><li>Right.
 And to all our friends who are professional photographers,
 AJ is not--
  </li><li>No goodness, no.
 I mean, I think you get it,
 but I mean, that wasn't what I was built for.
 This is, you know, and I could have done that,
 but this is what I'm built for.
 And I think that's the genius of God is,
 you know, you're his kid and he doesn't want you to miss out
 on what he actually made you for.
 even if you think this thing would be awesome.
 He's always, I mean, like we would, like good parents,
 you're gonna go, "Yeah, buddy, I totally get it
 "that a cookie's good, but have you tried a molten
 "law of a cake?"
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And until the child tries a molten lava cake,
 well, a cookie is a known thing
 that I can grip, get my head around, you know?
 So I just, I'm thankful that God is the way that he is
 and he doesn't give up on us.
  </li><li>I would say if you're in a season of discouragement
 or if you're in a season of waiting for things to look like
 you're dreaming and they're really not,
 that you would do yourself great service
 by listening to Danny's message from the first server.
  </li><li>Yeah, it'd be so good.
  </li><li>I'll put a link in our show notes.
 And then the second service he talked all about
 covenant relationships.
  </li><li>He did, and it was awesome.
 It was so good.
 And a lot of the examples that he was using and stuff
 was from all the Bethel leadership,
 'cause they've all been together over 35 years.
 and how they interact and whatever,
 but he was basically summarizing by saying,
 covenant relationship is I would take a bullet
 for that person.
 Or they would take a bullet for me.
 And that doesn't necessarily mean that you always agree,
 but it just does mean that you're gonna
 prioritize relationship.
  </li><li>Well, it also brought the whole thing full circle back
 to prioritizing connection.
 Like being in relationship doesn't mean you have to agree.
 It just means you choose me and I choose you.
 that that choice isn't based on agreement. Right.
 It's based on something different. Bill explains it like this. It's a father has two sons and one son is a
 Republican and the other son is a Democrat and when they get together as a family, they just bicker over politics
 But actually they're not bond. They're not driven away because of their differing views are joined together because of whose children they are
 Right. Yeah, and I thought oh
 I loved it anyway a full weekend
 So good if you haven't heard Danny silk I'd really encourage you to pick up some of his resources. He's got some excellent books one of my favorites is keep your love on it's a book that.
 Required reading on our school.
 You would be a great place to start his book culture of honor is also excellent.
 If you've got kids is loving your kids on purpose is excellent and any of his resources. I'll put a link in the show but if you're loving on purpose dot com that is his website that says ministry and.
 Just a great material.
 Yeah.
 Baby, are you ready for a listener's question?
 I believe I am.
 Well, I've got one right here from a Sarah.
 Hit me with it.
 All right.
 Sarah says this, I've learned so much through your teaching on leadership and
 walking under authority and have been in a season where God is now having me
 practice what I've learned.
 It's funny how that works, isn't it?
 My question is, how can you tell when you need to be obedient and walking
 underneath the leadership that you are currently under and when do you need to flee?
 For instance, I've had a mentor for many years that has recently made some decisions
 that have been a disappointment to me and disrupted the peace in my spirit.
 I want to proceed with this relationship in the right way, but many facets of trust have
 been broken and I don't see this mentorship continuing in a healthy way.
 How did you guys know when to stay underneath some of your leadership roles that have challenged
 you in the past and how did you know when to seek other leadership?
 amazing question. Such a great question. I guess my first answer would be talk to the Holy Spirit a lot about it
 because I've definitely had seasons where I've been under leaders where I didn't agree with what they were doing or the
 decisions that we were making, but the Holy Spirit asked me to stay and so I did.
 And it was great and it was a learning process, but it was really super hard. And I've also had times
 where the Holy Spirit is just said, and you're free to move on.
 Right.
 So my first thing would be you want to talk to the Holy Spirit about it because the thing
 is you don't really know what's going on with that other person.
 You don't know what's going on with the person that's mentoring you.
 And as I don't know who says it, Bill Johnson, whoever we're at our dumbest when we think
 we know the motives of another person's heart.
 So you don't know what's going on, but hopefully if they're mentoring you, you have the kind
 relationship where you could actually talk to them about, you know, what is disturbing
 your heart and have a real conversation.
 Like, this is what I'm experiencing.
 Can you talk to me about what's going on here?
 I don't feel safe.
 I feel like trust has been broken.
 Yeah.
 I'd also encourage you to look for a wider response than just a binary state of stay
 or go.
 And the reason I would suggest that is you've got years in this relationship.
 So it seems strange to me that your only two options are stay or go.
 So I would encourage you to sit down and say, can I share how I'm experiencing you?
 Or can I share how I'm experiencing some of your choices?
 Could you help me with this?
 And doing that will actually open up a dialogue that may actually serve your heart well.
 The other thing I want to encourage you is it's likely, and I'm certainly not cursing
 you here, but it's likely that most mentors in your life, most leaders in your life,
 are going to make decisions that will in some way disappoint you.
 Because actually they're generally speaking, not serving your vision,
 you're serving their vision. And sometimes we're fine following our leaders
 so long as they're leading us where we already want to go.
 And that's best case scenario. Let's go worst case scenario. Let's say that they screw up,
 they make a failure or they're not performing at their best or their actions or betraying what
 what you know they're hard to be. All of that still has valuable lessons for you in it,
 because God will use the weaknesses of others to refine the weaknesses in you. So God's
 actually more interested in our heart response to the mistakes of our leaders when he's talking
 to us than he is interested in talking to us about the mistakes that they've made.
 And the danger is that we confuse the anxiety in our heart as an indicator that we should
 correct our leaders rather than an indicator that the Lord wants to help us mature in our
 response to other people not succeeding.
 So I would encourage you that one of the key areas that you want to say I'm leaving and
 I'm done is when you veer into the area of spiritual abuse.
 And one of the healthiest ways that you can identify that is find other safe leaders to
 get their perspective on.
 Because usually when you're the person in a difficult season, you're not the best determinator
 of whether it's abuse or not.
 Because either it isn't and you're like, they're especially abusing me and I'm leaving, or
 it is.
 And you're like, I just need to learn something more.
 I just need to die more and both extremes aren't healthy.
 So finding other people that know you, that know them and in a way that isn't uncovering,
 just say, "Hey, I need some help.
 I'm out to lunch on this.
 This is how I'm experiencing this.
 Is my reaction good or do I need a break?"
 Yeah.
 And the only thing I would say to qualify that is just to make it really clear because I think
 this is what you're saying is whoever that person is that you talk to, make sure that
 there's somebody that can be part of the solution. So it's not just randomly talking
 to a bunch of different people or randomly talking to people that aren't actually part
 of the solution. It's talking to somebody who could actually help bring resolution and
 who knows you both.
 Right. There is a wonderful thing about praying the prayer like, "Lord, I am dying
 here. If that is the plan, give me the energy to die quietly. If it's not, would you open
 a door and either let me leave or shove them out? And I've read those prayers and seen
 amazing response to both of those.
 The lever shove prayer, there it is.
