<p> I'll in an age is but got more Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Jones is.
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode two hundred and seventy six of keeping up with the Jones is Mrs.
 AJ Jones. How are you?<br/>
 I am good.<br/>
 I think we should let the listeners know what's different about this week.
 Well, we've moved to doing just audio.
 So we're in your very messy office surrounded by horrible clutter.
 And I am sitting in a lounge chair while recording in a house.
 AJ looks like she's been waiting for an airplane for about 10 hours, has given up hope of life.
 And is just wanting to get on a plane and go home.
 You smooth tongue devil.<br/>
 So if Adeja sounds particularly soparific,
 it's because she's nearly passed out.
</p><ul>
  <li>It's Sunday night.
  </li><li>It is Sunday night. - We're recording
 on Sunday night, yeah.
  </li><li>Which this episode will be released tomorrow morning.
  </li><li>Yes. - God willing.
  </li><li>Yes, and I'm not staying up.
 Will you edit?
  </li><li>No, you're not.
  </li><li>I'm gonna have a bath.
  </li><li>Oh, there you go.
 What happened was last week, there was no episode.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And our members know this,
 'cause I reached out to our members and said,
 "Hey everybody, there's gonna be no episode this week."
 And here's why, one, I am desperately trying to finish our taxes.
 We have a tax appointment, which I completely forgot about.
 I mean, I knew that we had a tax appointment, but I thought it was next week.
 Yeah, different.
 And then I realized it was two days away.
 And I thought, I don't have anything ready for my accountant.
 So we're going to have to do our taxes.
 But also this course that you've heard me talk about for the last, I don't know, two
 months, the more than enough course, I really wanted to finish it.
 We were almost there.
 and I wanted to finish the course.
 And the other thing--
  </li><li>And there's limited time in the day.
  </li><li>Right. - In others,
 only so many hours.
  </li><li>'Cause we do this after our work.
 We do this on our weekends and our off weeks.
 And also we had a week where the kids really needed
 kind of more input than they were getting.
 So I just put out to the members and said,
 hey, I'm letting you know there's gonna be
 no podcast this week.
 But B, how big a deal is having the videos to you
 because the videos take us about,
 I don't know about 10 or 11 hours each week to edit.
  </li><li>And by us you mean you, I don't do video editing.
  </li><li>No you don't, but--
  </li><li>But I do everything else around the house
 so that you can do the video editing.
  </li><li>That is true.
 But also if you think about tonight,
 we both look like we've been dragged through a hedge backwards.
  </li><li>Thank you, darling.
  </li><li>I mean, you are not your most glamorous self.
  </li><li>Okay, you could stop talking about that.
  </li><li>And I am out either.
 Where's the first one to record for video?
 We'd have to shave, put on some decent clothes,
  </li><li>We're going to make up.
  </li><li>Exactly.
 So all in all, it's just easier if we just do audio.
 Now I want to keep doing video
 and we're making some investments
 to kind of reduce that 11 hour time
 to something slightly more reasonable.
 But for the next couple of weeks,
 at least we're going to be audio only,
 just so that A, we can keep doing a podcast
 and B, manage our limited time.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But anyway, if we sound a little different,
 it's because we're in a completely different room.
 We're using completely different microphones.
 But what's cute is it's all almost,
 as I was gonna say, it's the same equipment we started with,
 but it's really not.
  </li><li>It isn't.
  </li><li>Wait, I wanna take a photo of my wife.
 You need to see.
  </li><li>Please, no.
  </li><li>She is lunging.
  </li><li>No, no.
  </li><li>Maybe the people need to see.
 Oh my gosh, the glamour.
  </li><li>Put the phone down.
  </li><li>Put your cigarette out.
 (laughing)
 Okay, got it.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>What were we talking about?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>We're using some of the same equipment.
  </li><li>What do you mean is it's?
  </li><li>Are these are regional microphones?
  </li><li>Yeah, we're just using our old microphones,
 some headphones.
  </li><li>These are the microphones that we used
 when we recorded that podcast driving down to Florida.
 Do you remember?
 We recorded an episode while driving to the airport
 to pick up people and yeah, we've made it happen.
 So if we sound odd, that's why.
 We hope you've had a great week.
 We've got two weeks worth of stuff to catch up on.
  </li><li>I can't even remember the last two weeks.
  </li><li>Which is a testament to our life.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's been busy.
 The question on everyone's minds is did we get our taxes done?
 We did.
 Our taxes are filed.
 We're good citizens.
 Yes, we're legal.
 That was a relief.
 Yeah.
 But we didn't get anything back.
 That makes me sad.
 Well, it also means that we kind of made our, what do you call it, our withholding right
 on the nose?
 Ish.
 Ish.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Ish.
 The second question that everybody's wondering, I'm sure, is the more than enough course finished.
 I'm pleased to announce, ladies and gentlemen, it is.
 I was going to do a drum roll, but that would involve you moving your limbs, which at this
 point, I mean, you're going to have to carry me to bed after you're in the left of luxury.
 Look at you.
 The more than enough course is finished.
 What is the more than enough course?
 It is a course that is designed to help you understand what the Bible has to say about
 money, the topic of blessing and the topic of abundance.
 Now, while I've prepared this, I've realized that Christians have a really, really negative
 relationship with money.
 Yeah.
 Maybe two months ago, January, February, at Grace and I taught a series on finances,
 Tithing Blessing.
 We talked a little bit about it on earlier episodes of the podcast.
 But this is the most comprehensive course I know how to build all about generating wealth,
 partnering with heaven, what are the things that get in the way of us receiving blessing.
 It's out and you can sign up,
 you can work through the material at your own course.
 But if you sign up before April 18th,
 you can join me on Saturday mornings
 where I'm gonna coach you live, a group of students,
 I'm gonna walk you through the material together.
 So you're opportunity to answer, not answer, ask questions,
 share tests, when I get clarification,
 I'd love you to come and do it with me if you're available.
 It was gonna be April 15th,
 'cause I thought I was being clever,
 'cause that's when tax day is,
 but then my account had reminded me
 that they've changed it this year.
 It's April 18th.
 So if you're thinking, oh, no, I missed a deadline
 'cause after April 15th, you've still got another
 couple of days, April 18th, go to allen and ag.com/more
 to sign up enrolling the course.
 And because I think this is such a significant teaching,
 especially if you're married, like it's really important
 that both of you are on the same page,
 I've created a special discount for married couples
 who'd like to go through it together.
 And I think honestly, that's the only way
 you should go through it so that you're both
 on the same page of your money.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's super important to be on the same page.
 'Cause you don't need to add extra stress
 when you're trying to implement new things.
  </li><li>Stay with us, AJ, stay with us.
  </li><li>But-- - Don't head into the light.
 Don't head into the light.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I'm still here.
  </li><li>And how sweet did this week?
  </li><li>I told you, I can't remember this week.
  </li><li>What did you do last night?
  </li><li>What was last night?
 Oh, yeah, we went to a wedding.
 like a reception for wedding because some friends of ours got married during COVID
 and so they couldn't really have the reception that they wanted to have. And so they got to have
 it yesterday and it was beautiful. It was so fun. You danced. Yeah, you can't lock this up.
 Nobody puts baby in a corner. You never danced. Like I'm always like, I want to stay for the
 dancing. You're like, I want to go home. And you stayed like for ages and danced. I was... We had
  </li><li>I did great time.
 All the kids dance as well.
  </li><li>And they danced with you, that was so sweet.
 Was it really?
  </li><li>I got to dance with each of my kids and with you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You are horrible at letting me lead you in dancing.
  </li><li>You're horrible at leading.
  </li><li>Granted. - You don't know
 where you're going.
  </li><li>Nope, granted.
 But you need to just trust me.
  </li><li>Well, I would, except I'm afraid
 you're gonna put my back at it.
  </li><li>I hear excuses.
 So we need to work on that.
 Yeah, congratulations to Chris and Amanda.
  </li><li>Well, you know, do you remember
 When we first moved to Nashville,
 we were taking ballroom dancing lessons.
  </li><li>Yeah, don't you regret that now?
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>It was clearly always time
 'cause neither of us remembered anything.
  </li><li>But, well, okay, well, one of us didn't remember how.
 But, (laughs)
 but I think we should go back
 'cause clearly we need a refresher.
  </li><li>I was hoping that my Apple fitness lessons
 and dance would have served me well.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh, you've got to be joking.
  </li><li>But they didn't.
  </li><li>Okay, have we even posted a video of you doing those?
  </li><li>Let's move on.
 My favorite thing was when we left the wedding,
 I said to the kids, how did you enjoy the dancing?
 And my 14 year old said,
 the DJ just played really old stuff,
 like early Ed Sheeran music.
 I guess you missed out on the Stones and the Beatles,
 but sure, Ed Sheeran, that's right.
  </li><li>But what she did say it was a better DJ
 than they had at their school dance.
 So I was like, well, that's pretty good.
 Yeah, they had fun, it was good.
  </li><li>All right, our main topic for this week.
  </li><li>There is a topic.
 And I have some shame about it.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>Because it was...
  </li><li>Current.
  </li><li>Current, that's the word I was looking for.
 At the time I thought about it.
 But I wanna talk about Will Smith's slap
 of Chris Rock at the Oscars.
 Which is now not really current affairs.
 It's kind of old news and everyone's moved on from it.
 But we usually don't cover current affairs in our podcast,
 usually because by the time we get round to recording
 something or rather we record so early
 that the time we get round to releasing it,
 It's not really current affairs.
 Plus it's not really our skillset.
 But this one really, really struck me a couple of weeks ago.
  </li><li>Is that like there's no pun intended?
  </li><li>No pun intended.
  </li><li>Okay, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>You and I are getting ready for bed.
 We're not watching the Oscars,
 but I'm scrolling through Twitter and Twitter explodes
 because as I'm sure everyone knows by now,
 the comedian Chris Rock makes a joke
 at the expense of Will Smith's wife, Jada?
 Is that right?
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Will proceeds to get up on stage live in front of everybody and turns out he hand slaps Chris Rock in the face at first I thought it was a punch.
 Well, no, I told you he slapped me anyway.
 That discussion.
 Right.
 So we're watching that on Twitter.
 And at first, I can't tell if it's like part of a sketch or something funny, but then quickly realize everything gets real because we'll scream it at.
 Will is now screaming, expletives at Chris, twice.
 And if you've ever watched somebody lose it,
 you can tell Will is losing it, right?
 The second one especially, his vocal core,
 you know, he's doing that thing where you're like,
 "Oh, this man is in distress."
 And fair play to Chris.
 He's doing a pretty good job at trying to de-escalate things,
 which it doesn't really work.
 You can tell Will is at a tipping point.
 You could tell Chris was nearly gonna make another joke
 'cause, you know, as a comedian,
 and that thing's just queued up in his head.
 He thinks the better of it.
 Now, because I'm on Twitter
 and I'm not watching the US broadcast,
 I'm watching the uncensored version,
 I think from Japan and Australia.
 And, you know, so a lot of people in America
 didn't know what's happened
 because it, you know, got bleeped and centered,
 so it was hard to make sense.
 But what everybody saw was Will Smith
 get up on stage in front of Hollywood
 and in front of millions of viewers,
 smack somebody in the face,
 then go sit down, his rage is on full display,
 but then goes on to win the Oscar for the best
 actor in the leading role.
 And so now has to give a speech.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So I couldn't really sleep
 because I needed to know how the thing resolved itself.
 And it wasn't like this salicious gossip in my heart.
 I think for me, what happened
 is will manage to give all of us a gift,
 probably not Chris a gift,
 but give all of us a gift of humanity.
 Of humanity on display.
 His vulnerability of losing his temper
 and his vulnerability of the sadness of sabotage.
 Here's this big event.
 So I watched lots of people offering commentary
 and who was right and who was wrong,
 what should have been done, all that sort of stuff.
 But I wanted to look at it in a slightly different way
 and talk about the humbling nature of being human.
 And by that, I mean,
 how many of us have ever done or said something
 that we felt was out of control?
 And what do you do with that pain?
  </li><li>Like afterwards.
  </li><li>Afterwards.
 Like have you, Adrijones, ever said something,
 done something in a fit of,
 I don't know, anger, fear, sadness, loneliness,
 and then later realized I actually betrayed
 who I am by my behavior by my words.
  </li><li>Two hours later.
  </li><li>I mean, I must have.
  </li><li>I can't believe you're taking this long to think,
 'cause I came prepared with a list of times you've done it.
  </li><li>You did?
  </li><li>No, I'm kidding.
 I haven't got it.
  </li><li>I was like, that would help me.
  </li><li>Never as a parent, you've said or done something,
 you later wish you hadn't said or done something.
  </li><li>Oh, probably.
 Oh, I'm sure.
 I'm just trying to think of like,
  </li><li>Probably.
  </li><li>Oh, I'm sure, 'cause I know I've said,
 because Mummy said so.
  </li><li>Have you ever wanted to take a dump
 in your husband's shoes, for example?
  </li><li>Oh yeah, well, yeah.
  </li><li>You can't even think about it in our marriage,
 times that you've said things
 that you wish you could take back?
  </li><li>Um, yes, I can.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>You can tell these episodes are not rehearsed.
 (laughing)
 'Cause this is a live live reaction.
  </li><li>This is not a funny one,
 but I'm gonna sit on the podcast.
  </li><li>Okay, well that's helpful for a movie.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 I guess I can think of, well, jump in shoes, for sure.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>I can think of--
  </li><li>When I told you to get out, get out.
  </li><li>The time you grabbed a baby and ran away,
 and then I stood at the door and,
 what do you mean you don't feel safe
 as I'm yelling at the top of my lungs?
 I'm just thinking about, like, I know, I watched Will
 and my empathy level went through the light,
 through the roof because I was like, I know what it's like to be
 will. I've never slapped anybody to my knowledge. Like, I remember
 having a fight with somebody I lived on a street with when I
 was a little boy. But I've never had a physical altercation with
 anyone. But I can think of times when it's almost like your
 body does something without your own permission. Yeah. And then
 you're left with the shame of it. And you want to minimize it,
 you want to, or I want to minimize it, I want to justify it,
 I want to run away, I want to hide.
 I remember one night, this is a horrible memory for me.
 I remember it was S.O.S.L. graduation one year.
 I'm, I think I was, am seeing it.
 And I'm running through it and I'm realizing
 we're short on time.
 And I remember looking at my notes and usually, you know,
 we congratulate all the students, but then we also stop
 and thank all of our staff for all the hard work
 of that year.
 And in my head, I'm like, ah, no, that's a good way
 of saving time.
 I don't need to thank our staff.
 our staff know they've done a good job.
 Like so I make that call in my head and I get through it.
 And I think the whole speech has been a success
 and I sit down and either you or Jeff pointing out to me,
 "Hey Alan, you forgot to thank your staff."
 And I was like, "Oh no, no, I see your heart
 trying to help me."
 I didn't forget I made a deliberate decision not to.
 Thinking I'd made a good decision, right?
 Thinking, "Oh, people are fine."
  </li><li>They were over time.
  </li><li>They were over time and they all know they did a good job
 which is a really curious thing, a mission for me to make as I hate high words of affirmation
 person. But I think all my staff are going to be fine. And then I look over and see some
 of my staff who I love deeply in pain. Like I can see tears in their eyes. And in that
 instant, I am like, I have made a horrible, horrible mistake. And there's no way for me
 to get out of that. And I remember just leaving the room in tears, getting in the car and
 driving home and just hoping the earth would swallow me.
 Because I'm realizing I made, it wasn't an accident,
 it wasn't an oversight, I made a deliberate choice
 that has now hurt people and actually has written
 a story on their hearts that isn't true.
 And any effort for me to rewrite that story
 is gonna just sound defensive or I don't know how to get
 out of it and I just feel alone.
 And I haven't done any of my feelings work.
 But my only solution seemingly is to run away.
 And I run away and I hid and I didn't want to see any
 of my staff and this is a test of me
 how brave and powerful my staff are.
 Eventually they came and confronted me.
 I don't mean eventually.
 I mean, a couple of days they were like,
 "What happened? That was such a departure
 "from who we knew to be now."
 Thankfully I had time to cool down.
 You know, and also no, we've got so much trust
 with our staff.
 In that one moment, I knew what it was like to kind of ruin the night of people it was so important for.
 And I'm thinking about Will.
 Like, this is potentially, he doesn't know he's going to win, but potentially is going to be one of the biggest nights of his life.
 He's running for an Oscar, his third nominee.
 So he knows what it's like to be nominated.
 Doesn't know what it's like to win.
 Yeah.
 And so you can hear the tension.
 Now what's curious is the next day I got up and I tried to watch stuff and I saw an interview with
 Denzel Washington. This is pre the Oscars everyone's going on the red carpet
 So like Denzel is already saying yeah like his he's got lots of emotions
 He's got lots of feelings, you know, he's gonna have to manage them like Denzel doesn't realize he's being prophetic in that moment
 but
 You know, I'm I'm thinking
 You know in Will's acceptance speech you can realize not only is he embarrassed himself. Yeah, but he's also
 Just taking a giant poop in front of everybody and ruined everybody else's night
 and now he has to get up and give a speech when he does win yeah and
 Like he should be feeling joy and celebration
 Oh, he's probably feeling grief and sadness and
 You know, so I'm not saying all I'm saying is I know what it was like to be will in that moment
 And I'm thinking I only know what it's like to be will in that moment. I have not never won an Oscar
 Because you're human too, but I know what it's like to ruin a special event
 I know what it's like for my behavior my words to betray who I am and I think the saddest part is will speech
 She said you know
 I feel like God's called me to be a vessel of love and at that point my heart broke
 You know, I saw people making fun of them going, hey, you know top tip
 If you're gonna be a vessel of love don't go and smacking people
 But I heard it as him going I can't be what God wants me to be in my own strength
 Yeah, and I'm like oh is there anything more human than than that moment. I think
 Well first of all when you asked earlier
 Can I think of moments it always takes me a little bit longer?
 I know that you had your list but just as I'm thinking about it like, you know
 I punched somebody at church where everybody could see me hundreds of people looking through the glass while I punched another youth leader in the face of church. I've had my moments.
 I knew they were in there just in clock enough. You could think about.
 I was thinking another time somebody hurt my cousin and I went over to their house and basically just walked in their house and I ran up one side of her and down the other while her parents were there listening.
 Yeah, I've had my moments, my human moments.
 I think what makes me sad is like I didn't, I'm not really on social media that much,
 but the little bit that I did see, it didn't seem like there was, or at least what I saw,
 there was an enormous amount of grace or mercy towards Will.
 And that kind of made me sad because I'm like, wait, again, what of us haven't had just a
 really awful moment where we fleshed out. And it just happened to be that his is on TV.
 And he's famous. So he's living under the spotlight anyway.
 Yeah.
 You know,
 And also understand that we're not minimizing what he did, like what he did was clearly
 wrong. But what you're saying is like, are we all forgetting that we've had moments when
 we have said or done something that has repercussions far larger than we're currently aware of?
 Yeah.
 come rushing to you. I'm sure when he sat down, he realized, holy monkey, what have I just
 done? Oops, I've just cussed out on live TV. Oops, I've just done it again.
 Yeah. Like we've all had those experiences. I'm not the only one, right? Listen, we have
 had experiences where there's repercussions larger than we anticipated. And then when
 that news hits us, we realize there's really no way to take them back. And what are you
 do in that moment is actually the test of character. Yeah. So what do you do when you screw up
 spectacularly, AJ Jones? Try and clean up your mess. You know, so I guess it depends on who the
 mess is with, but you're, I mean, first get your heart right, you know, and then go and try clean
 up your mess. So apologize, ask for forgiveness, find out what people need, that kind of thing.
 And it's important to understand that apologies aren't just words.
 There might be actions that need to follow up with the words to demonstrate your story.
 Yeah.
 I also, I agree with everything you said, but I also think about the need
 to explore your story to how you ended up there.
 Yeah.
 Like what is familiar to you in what ways is your childhood story revisiting
 you where that then becomes seemingly your only option.
 Yeah.
 Well, because usually, I mean, it seemed like he just had an instant reaction.
 Well, yeah, if you watch back, he's actually laughing at Chris's joke.
 Right. When Chris makes the joke, you see Will laughing.
 You see Jada not laughing.
 Presumably you then see Will looking at Jada's face.
 And of course, I don't know what it's like to be a woman who's losing her hair.
 I can imagine how big a deal that is.
 I'm also not a black woman.
 And I don't know too much about black culture, but some of the stuff I've read is like,
 the grief and sadness about losing your hair. So, you know, I don't know if Will just felt super
 defensive. I had no idea what's going on. I don't know the dynamics of their marriage or anything.
 That's not what I'm in. You know, commenting on I'm more commenting on my heart went out because I
 have been where he is, which sounds ridiculous because I'm not an Alyssa. I think we all know
 what I mean. I don't need to keep it. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, you've had your, you've had your
 reactive. Oh, as a parent, you know, when you, you know, when you like, I remember one time
 feeling so stressed and Abigail was what two years old and I'd come home from work and you know,
 she wants something. And I remember just turning that turning around and in my anxiety, my fear,
 my dread. Again, not knowing that's why I'm feeling I haven't done any feelings work and just yelling
 at her because she's the source of my pain. She's not she just happened to be in the wrong place in
 in the wrong time and be a child and have needs.
 And it was one more area where I feel like I'm failing
 in my ability to meet the needs of my family.
 And that's what it took.
  </li><li>You can go repair it, you know?
 And so often when the event is larger than your reaction,
 it's larger than the event warrants.
 The issue is not the issue.
 So Will Hicken Chris is not about the joke.
 It's about something else.
 And it really touched me.
 I woke up the next morning at 4.30,
 'cause I'd barely slept and I was just praying for him.
 And, oh, do you wanna talk about Denzel's role
 in being a peacemaker?
  </li><li>I know that he sort of coached him somehow.
  </li><li>Imprayed for him.
  </li><li>Imprayed for him.
  </li><li>And a break.
  </li><li>And somebody else came over and prayed for him too.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>And then basically just sort of said,
 hey, you know, these are the moments
 you have to watch out for the devil.
  </li><li>And your highest moment is when the devil will attack.
 I was like, "Come on, Denzel."
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I saw Denzel being interviewed by TDJ.
  </li><li>TDJ, yeah.
  </li><li>I was like, "Okay, this is beautiful."
  </li><li>Yeah, I realized that when you're talking about,
 you know, I woke up at 4.30 or whatever,
 and you've been, you did like a little bit of a deep dive
 and people were attracted. - Clearly struck a chord
 in my heart, yeah.
 And honestly, for me, it didn't because in my head,
 I'm like, you know, a man slapped another man
 at an awards show, yes, but there's a war in the Ukraine,
 you know, and they're finding hundreds of bodies
 and you know what I mean?
 So like for me, I didn't really put much more thought into it.
 Like he had a human moment and really unfortunate
 that it happened on public television.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I feel sad for him and that's it.
 Like that sort of word ends for me because again, there's,
 there's much bigger things going on,
 but of course because it's Hollywood and it's dirt, I guess.
  </li><li>But how true is that?
 I mean, that's a very salient point you make,
 but how true is that also?
 Like I think about the time that I left,
 I left the event, you know, I left graduation,
 I went home in my shame, in my fear, crying,
 thinking about all the people I've ruined
 their night and hurt them. And and and here's the thing.
 Not that I'm minimizing my hurt or my damage, but I hurt and
 grieved our staff, but the 70 or so students who are graduating,
 they didn't know like what I'm saying is you put things correctly in
 their global perspective. Often when we have done something wrong,
 we lose sight of perspective. As in the enemy will have a field
 angle. Yeah, you are the worst father, mother, teacher, whatever,
 you're the worst person in the world. This is the biggest thing.
 So when everyone's mind, everyone is not sleeping about it, you need to go fix it, you know, blah, blah, blah.
 And the reality is that's not what's going on. Life still goes on. It's all okay. You can fix whatever happened.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 So my homework for listeners this week,
 Oh, homework is take a moment and think about if you've got a moment where it was a big event,
 where the reaction was larger than the event warranted, and maybe do some homework.
 like, what was the feelings? What was the story the enemy would love to sell you?
 How did it sound? And maybe write it out. You're a bad mom,
 you're a terrible husband, you're a terrible pastor, whatever it may be.
 Write out in detail what was the story that you learned and now, depending on how much time
 it's passed, how true is that story? And maybe did you clean it up? And if you didn't,
 What are some of the steps that you can do to clean up?
 Because sometimes we don't want to clean it up.
 Sometimes we do, oh, nobody's talking about it
 and now it's fine.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But it's still probably worth some investigation.
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause probably there's still something
 that's weighing on your own heart as well.
 I think also though, can I just, I love your homework.
 Can I, can I share a small pet peeve?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So I do have a pet peeve about,
 about Hollywood and about how quick Christians are to judge people in a Hollywood when they
 make a mistake and it makes me super sad because I'm like, actually, I don't want their life.
 They live under a microscope and everybody feels really comfortable always having an
 opinion on their lives.
 My thought is, I wish we would pray more for them.
 You know what I mean?
 Rather than be really happy to be like,
 did you see, you know, whatever.
 So I just as like a side note as a pet peeve,
 like when you see behavior that you're like, man, you know,
 and it gets the world's attention to me,
 that's a great opportunity to start praying for those people
 'cause they're gonna have a roll of rough week.
  </li><li>Yes.
 And what if we responded differently?
 That's my only thought.
  </li><li>So you've added, I'm gonna have two pieces of homework.
  </li><li>Two pieces of homework.
  </li><li>Is there any areas where we've judged Hollywood?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Or just judged in general.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And what is the stuff we might need to do
 to clean up our own mess?
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And I mean, I really, I think it's not just Hollywood,
 whoever the famous people are for you.
 'Cause you're your famous people, maybe your pastor.
 I mean, you know what I mean?
 Like whoever's under the microscope, you know, what if we extended grace and, and, and prayed for breakthrough for those people?
 That's my, I don't know.
 That's fine.
 All right.
 Well, now you can probably see why we don't do current events because it's not a current.
 And we're not great commentators on stuff like that, but some things to think about this.
 You go, let's not do that again.
 AJ, if people want to get the show notes for this episode, they would go to where they would go to.
 Alanaj.com/276.
 -That's very good.
 I did wild gesticulations across the studio.
 -I was like, "Wait, I don't know what number it is."
 -I think A.G. Jones needs a round of applause
 for not falling asleep on this week's episode.
 -Because you even have mood lighting going on in here.
 -It's hardly mood lighting, though.
 I mean, it's just...
 -Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.
 If you would like to become a member of the show,
 I'm doing the background.
 That's great.
 Could you stop?
 Okay.
