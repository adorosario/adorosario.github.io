<p> Hey, baby hello<br/>
 Ola you look in top form<br/>
 Do I is it possible because we've been out on a date?
 We were on a date. Do you want to talk about that? Yes, we went
 to go and see Brian Regan Regan Regan Regan I think it's Regan Brian Regan
 Who's a comedian who is awesome? Totally clean content very funny very expressive
 And I was at the rhyme and auditorium it was I love the rhyming I never understand why people love it. It's old
 It's old but lovely. It's not lovely<br/>
 You sit on church pews for good music. I like the rhyming
 History of the rhyming sure<br/>
 And then we went to a delz<br/>
 Well, we technically went to a delz first we did and had dinner there we did and you had amazing
 gnocchi. Yeah, it was so good. I imagine a hate pronounce, gnocchi.
 Gnocchi. But there's no before the kir, gnocchi. I know, but I'm just saying I had an Italian
 roommate. That's what she told me how to say it. She has speech impediment. Maybe. I know.
 But it was really good. It was like with winter squash and... It was delicious. It was the
 classes I've ever had to savory marshmallow.
 Uh, it had texture of soft pillowy goodness.
 It was delicious.<br/>
 Marshmallow.<br/>
 Well, marshmallow texture.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 I don't like marshmallow texture.<br/>
 But anyway, we had a great date.<br/>
 You know what else we had a great date with who what?
 We had a sushi date with Michael John.
 We did.<br/>
 He tried his first sushi.<br/>
 He did.<br/>
 No, bless everyone called child services.
 It wasn't raw fish, but he didn't like it.
 He wasn't too fond of the seaweed.<br/>
 He just wanted to eat a mommy.<br/>
 Yeah, the child can pack at a mommy way.
 He was not interested in even chicken nuggets and fries.
 If they said a mommy, he just wants those.
 You know what else I need to update our listeners on.
 Well, I thought you were going to update me on something.
 I'm like, what else did you feed our child?
 Nothing.<br/>
 No, we need to update our listeners on the hippie nonsense.
 The hippie nonsense.<br/>
 You do.<br/>
 You challenged me last week to take the essential oils of peppermint, lemon and lavender.
 And we've since realized we were doing it wrong.
 We were diffusing one drop of each into water and drinking it.
 That's not what I was doing, but anyway.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I was, I was doing two drops of each in water three times a day, which would be a total of six drops.
 Right.<br/>
 But we learned that we were doing it wrong because we're diluting it.
 Rather, what we are supposed to do is put five drops of each in a glycerin capsule,
 swallow the whole capsule.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 and take them twice a day.<br/>
 Well technically you're supposed to take it once a day but you're taking it twice a day at the moment to get your build up up or something.
 Right it's all scientific.<br/>
 It's very sad.<br/>
 Hence the hippie nonsense.<br/>
 However, however, it doesn't work at all.
 You're lying.<br/>
 It has dramatically reduced my reaction to allergies but I don't know if that's just this week we've had lots of rain.
 so maybe the rain has kept pollinaby something works okay i
 neither of us know how works but i will say taking those little capsules
 is like little peppermint bombs that go off in your tummy and then make your
 belches absolutely foul and the smell of lavender or lemon or peppermint is just
 nasty but i have suffered way less with sneezing
 analogies you really have and i have suffered way
 last with your snoring. I would say it's a 90% reduction. See? And snoring? I snore.
 Like you're shocked? No, I didn't realize this was stopping the snoring. It's not stopping it,
 it's just making it so that I can actually sleep. It's less. It's your snoring less loudly.
 Oh, but there's less. There's less.<br/>
 Going on while you're sleeping. Okay. That's good. We said this week we were going to live
 adventurously. And so not only did we try Adele's, which was new, you try to very strange tea with
 rose petals and something. But you liked it. I had so many man punks this week, I could try
 a flowery drink. Yeah, I mean, you were so manly this week. But you're really manly anyway.
 It's ridiculous. I'm practically bursting out of the shirt. And that is why MJ calls you the man.
 He calls me the big man the big man and daddy you big man daddy you big man.
 You like that's right son and and then we also went to swanky taco shot we back up because we also went to the local taco.
 I'm back on a taco diet all taco all taco all day all day long i finished speaking of church this morning
 and i was it was the joy set before me was tacos.
 Wow.<br/>
 I'm wondering, and I, please forgive me.
 If our British listeners know what tacos are now, forgive me if that's incredibly patronizing or patronizing.
 But either one of those.<br/>
 But I'm the guy who I have, I have eight tacos when I was in Scotland.
 That's very strange.<br/>
 And I don't think I could have told the difference between a taco, a burrito, an enchilada.
 So for the benefit of our listeners, a taco is basically a Mexican sandwich.
 Wow.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 What an enchilada wrapped up Mexican sandwich with sauce on it.
 An enchilada, another Mexican sandwich.
 Well, a bill to build your own Mexican sandwich.
 I just snorted.<br/>
 I don't even know what to say to that.
 What I mean by that is the staple food in a British diet is a sandwich.
 Two pieces of bread with some filling in the middle.
 That is one of the most terrifying pieces of information I've ever heard.
 But it's true.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 A taco is basically one continuous piece of bread, in this case, a flower flat piece of...
 Okay.<br/>
 Listen, you want to try tacos.<br/>
 If you don't know what a taco is, I'm sorry.
 But, you know, again, pardon my ignorance, but I don't think I ever tried proper tacos till I came here.
 Oh, okay.<br/>
 Let's say we went to local taco and then we went to Swanky's taco shop.
 Yes.<br/>
 And had some amazing fish tacos.<br/>
 You did, yes.<br/>
 And shrimp tacos.<br/>
 And steak taco.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Once I find a good place, I do want to work through the menu and make sure that I have tried all
 our tacos, so I know.<br/>
 However, possibly the most exciting part of our weekend.
 Was my Tarzan outfit?<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 As you spoke at church this morning in Lycra.
 That's a terrible vision.<br/>
 Yeah, just erase that from your minds, people.
 Yeah, I spoke at church this morning.<br/>
 You did.<br/>
 It's almost fun to speak on Sunday morning.
 Yeah, I love it.<br/>
 And it feels like you get two different audiences, first service
 and second service.<br/>
 You totally do.<br/>
 Both equally resplendent, but you are at least I find myself
 adjusting the way I speak to cater for both audiences, which is
 great.<br/>
 I love that experience.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah, it was really good.<br/>
 And you spoke on a tale of two sauce.<br/>
 Yeah, just basically.<br/>
 I think the thing I've been pondering for the last couple of months is the importance of
 believing God. I know the sense absurd, but I think there's a danger that we believe God,
 and then we stop believing God. But because he's always taking us from glory to glory,
 the path from one level of glory to the next level of glory requires belief. And so I was
 looking at the two souls in Scripture, King Saul, and then Saul of Tarsus, who later became the
 Apostle Paul. And I was reading them in parallel and thinking both of these souls had an incredible
 encounter with the Lord, Saul with the prophet Samuel. I mean if you read that,
 encounter is just staggering as an incredible encounter. And then Saul, who of course meets
 the Lord on the road to Damascus. They both have an incredible destiny. I mean,
 And Saul gets called out as the king of Israel.
 And Saul gets called out as an apostle to the Gentiles.
 And they both have incredible destinies waiting for them.
 And yet only one of them actually believes God.
 Yeah, the response is completely different.
 And so Saul, it actually says the Lord said to Samuel, "I wish it never made Saul king."
 Which is just probably one of the saddest verses in Scripture.
 Because anyway, I was just, you know, I was sharing on these two things and I was sharing
 how it's possible to opt out of your destiny.
 It's possible that God could set things up, He could give you incredible future and you
 decide not to step into it, which I think would be tragic.
 I'll tell you another thing I was thinking about was John Podjax and his memorial.
 You know, it was a couple of weeks ago, I may have mentioned this on the podcast.
 And his, one of his old friends was on this memorial video I was watching.
 And he was saying, "When I knew John Paul, we used to drive to work every day.
 He was an executive for the same company we worked in.
 He wasn't in ministry.<br/>
 He didn't think he'd ever be called in ministry."
 Whenever I brought up the topic, John Paul would just say, "I'm not prophetic.
 I don't think I've got a call in ministry.
 I don't think I've got anything to offer in that realm."
 And then thinking if he kept listening to that voice, the whole world would have been
 robbed from the incredible ministry that John Paul had.
 He was hugely influential for me in learning to prophesy and learning to minister prophetically.
 He had a huge profound impact on me.<br/>
 I was thinking about how often do we slow down what God's doing in our life because of unbelief.
 And actually the encouragement to believe God.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Oh, I'm just thinking, one of the things that we always say is prophecy is always an invitation.
 I think sometimes people treat prophecy like it's a given and it is actually an invitation.
 It requires your response.<br/>
 It requires you to activate your faith.
 It requires you to pursue the things of God.
 And I don't mean crowbar your way into anything, but I mean, be saying yes as you're doing
</p><ul>
  <li>As a response.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 As you're doing whatever you are currently being faithful and be saying yes to whatever
 it is that he's creating for your destiny.
 So, yeah, there is an often a census, you know, in some conversations, I've had with people
 where they think the prophecies are done deal.
 Mm-hmm.
 Like it's this kind of fatalistic thing.
 Well, if it's got all happening, if it's not, it won't.
 And you're like, ah, not really.
 Doesn't work that way.
 Yeah, you actually get to partner with it.
 I mean, Saul, who later became Paul, could have listened to Ananias' words and was like,
 wow, I don't think it's really me.
 And I don't think they'll believe me.
 And, you know, I've done all these bad things.
 But instead he actually chose to believe what God said and you see that as a mark through all of his writings.
 You know, his every letter is he states that he is Paul an apostle called by the Lord Jesus Christ.
 And he could have said, "Well, you know, I'm not like a real apostle because they got to walk with Jesus and I didn't."
 No, he didn't excuse himself.
 And I, Graham Cook says this wonderful thing that God meets us with who we are and we meet him with who we're not.
 Yeah, it's totally true.
 tell they true. Our first response is to say no to God. And you see that all the way through
 scripture with Moses, with Sarah, with Abraham, you know, the list goes on and on with Gideon,
 with Saul, you know, people just go, no, Jeremiah, I'm not a prophet, you know, I'm just this young
 boy. And I wonder why it's so hard to believe God. And I think it's just
 Probably because we've got so used to listening to the enemy and we think the enemy's voice is
 the norm. So we've spent years listening to why we're not qualified, which is tragic.
 Yeah, it really is. That was a great quote from Stephen Fertik, who is my sister's pastor out in
 North Carolina. He said this, "If you're not daring to believe God for the impossible,
 you're sleeping through some of the best parts of your Christian life.
 And further still, if the size of your vision or your life isn't intimidating to you,
 there's a good chance it's insulting to God.
 Two years ago, some more conference, we had David Wagner and Gary Morgan in.
 And I don't think even Gary was ministering. Was he Gary and Sir King Moore?
 No, they were just visiting.
 They were just hanging out with us.
 So who were the speakers at the conference?
 Lyle.
 Lyle Phillips, David Wagner.
 and Brian and Katie Torwalt were not in worship.
 And the final night of the service came and got hijacked.
 Do you remember that?
 Talked me through what happened there
 'cause that was one of your moments
 where you actually had to say enough is enough
 and I believe God.
  </li><li>Well, you know, the sort of backstory on it
 was right before we moved down here,
 we had this sort of weird conversation/interchange
 with Bob Jones.
 And in the process of that, he said to me, you know, your profit.
 And, and I was like, oh, yeah, uh huh.
 Okay.
 Thanks, you know, and just sort of wrote it off.
 And then we had a girl.
 Well, we, we moved down here and it was only after a couple of months.
 We ended up hosting, was it Sharon Stone?
 Yeah, we've also had a bunch of people, but Sharon was one of the,
 she was one of the ones.
 And we're sitting there at lunch with her,
 and all of a sudden the mill lunch,
 she turns around and says, "Profitas, profitas,
 profitas," and starts prophesying over me about being profit.
 And I'm like, "Okay."
  </li><li>You know, can you pass us all please?
  </li><li>Right.
 And then I'm trying to think who,
 there was some-- - Shumbles.
  </li><li>Shumbles. - Chris Valleton.
  </li><li>And then Chris Valleton was the one
 that kind of messed me up a bit,
 because we had gone out for dinner with him,
 and Jeff and Becky and all that kind of stuff.
 And I think you had driven home to get something.
 And so I drove back with Chris and with Jeff.
 And as we were leaving the car, and we're just
 walking across the parking lot, Chris said,
 you know you're a profit, right?
 And I just turned around and I looked at him.
 And I totally felt like a deer in headlights.
 And I just said, well, I mean, I don't know.
 I know I'm prophetic and whatever.
 I just sort of was all shook up and he said, "AJ, you know, you're never actually going
 to be a prophet until you actually started agreeing with God."
 Which is great because Graham Cook, when he was here, said the same thing, he was talking
 about his journey into the prophetic office and he had a similar experience.
 You're not going to believe, you're not going to function in what you are until you believe
 what God says you are.
 But that hurdle feels enormous, doesn't it?
 feels like you're moving in presumption.
  </li><li>Pretentious, it feels like self-promoting,
 it feels all kinds of things.
 So after that, a couple months later,
 I went out to do Patricia King's TV show.
  </li><li>That's right.
  </li><li>And Patricia King has been somebody
 who's been significant for me for like 20 years.
 And so whenever we'd be in the same town or same city,
 we would always get a meal together.
 And she's just really spoken life to me
 and encouraged me in a lot of ways
 and encouraged me when I stepped up to ministry
 and all that kind of stuff.
 And so I went to do the show and then we went out for lunch
 and after lunch, we were just sitting there,
 it was as Patricia and Ron and myself
 and this other fellow was really nice as a prophet
 from Canada, I can't remember what his name was.
 And so Patricia just said, "So what's going on with you?"
 And I said, "Can I run something by you?"
 'Cause you've known me and I'm kind of thinking
 Patricia's going to go, oh, they just mean prophetic.
 You know, like, so I'm repeating, you know, this is what happened in BloBloBlo.
 And then Chris said this to me, isn't that outrageous?
 You know, not quite, I wasn't quite saying it that way, but I was just like, you know,
 I was your inference.
 Right.
 And, and she said, well, I tell you a story.
 So she told me a story about, about her that was really, really similar.
 And she came to the end of that story and she said, you know, I went to this person
 who was a friend of mine who was a ministry.
 And I felt like I was totally not what they had said that I was.
 And I was sitting in his office and he said, you know, Patricia, until you agree with God,
 you're not going to be what you, you know, what he said you are.
 And he had made her stay in his office for like an hour and a half or something until she would
 agree and actually say, I am a prophet.
 And so she said, it took her, you know, she's like, it took me a really long time, but the meeting
 had already started and you know whatever. So finally I said it and he let me out of his
 office, but she said something changed. And I was like, Oh, that's really cool. You know,
 and I'm thinking I'm so encouraged. And but Ron and I should have left like 10 minutes
 ago to get to the airport. So I was like, okay, thank you for sharing that and everything.
 And she goes, Oh, no, AJ, you're not leaving this table until you say it. And I was like,
 Well, what? And she's like, no, I want you to say it. And I just burst into tears. And
 I was like, Patricia, I can't.
 It's so presumptuous.
 It's so self-promoting or whatever.
 And she's like, you're not the one that's been saying it.
 Everybody else has and whatever.
 So anyway, by the end, I did say it.
 And it was funny because I said it pretty quietly.
 And she said, you need to say it again.
 And the other prophetic guy was like, yeah, you do.
 And so I said it again.
 She's like, one more time.
 And when I said it the third time,
 I heard a clap right behind my head, like a pop,
 but really loud.
 And she goes, it's done.
 Okay, Ron, you better get her to the airport, you know,
 and that was it, we just left.
  </li><li>So amazing.
  </li><li>But still, that was like in the fall,
 and it wasn't until the following May
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>That this whole thing happened where in the morning--
  </li><li>Oh yes, I forgot, this is the story I wanted you to tell.
  </li><li>In the morning during church, I was emceeing,
 and the presence of the Lord was so strong,
 and I heard him say, "Take off your shoes."
 And so I took off my shoes, which was fine.
 And then I just wept.
 Like I wept all the way through,
 MCing the meeting, and then Jeff got up
 to try and help me and he started crying.
 I mean, it was just like super, super intense.
  </li><li>Was it not fast?
  </li><li>Was it not fast, for sure.
 And I knew God was doing something.
 And I probably have to look back at my journal
 'cause I knew he was, there was a whole bunch
 of different things that he was showing me.
 And I was just like, okay.
 And I was hearing things and you know, it was just like, oh my gosh, I'm fully dialed
 in here and this is a pretty overwhelming end.
 So, we went out for lunch with all the speakers and whatever.
 And when we were leaving the building, like I went to put my shoes on at the front and
 I felt like the lurch said, don't put them on.
 So I carried them and then I thought, well, I'll put them on when I get to the car park.
 And I felt like the lurch said, don't put them on.
 And I was like, okay.
 So we went to the bonefish and I thought for sure they'd stop me because you're not allowed
 to go in without shoes but nobody looked at my feet.
 So I just walked in without my shoes on and sat there.
 And I was shirtless so we broke both rules.
 It was perfect.
 And then came back and I was chatting with Gary before I was supposed to speak and I
 was just saying to him like I don't, you know, I went recounted the whole like recounted
 the whole prophetic thing. And I was just like, you know, and I feel like the Lord is saying,
 don't wear your shoes, but I don't know if I'm just making that up because maybe I want to
 seem religious or whatever. And Kerry's like, that's not your heart. I mean, he was so encouraging.
 He's like, you're not listening to the right voice, you know, in those perspectives.
 And I decided to speak on destiny. And I really didn't know if I was going to make it through.
 I didn't know if I'd get my mouth open. Because remember, that's what happened to begin with,
 I couldn't get my mouth to work on Sunday morning.
 Like I couldn't get my mouth open.
 I just stood there and cried for ages and nobody helped me.
 But anyway, I instagrammed you.
 Thank you, darling.
 That's very helpful.
 You're welcome.
 Um, so anyway, uh, I got up to speak and I thought both David and Gary had moved forward on their chairs.
 And I didn't realize in the background, Gary had already talked to Jeff about
 something and they all had this thing planned.
 I just thought they were both sitting forward to show me like we're here to help you if your mouth gets stuck again, right?
 Whatever. So I was like, they're so sweet to sit forward like that. Like they're ready to come to my rescue.
 And so I did my message on
 basically walking in your destiny and agreeing with God.
 That you I and I
 Recounted like recounted the whole thing of like what Chris said, you know
 You're never gonna actually walk into your destiny unless you started agreeing with God
 And so I just said something like so I'm gonna start agreeing with God and I was getting ready to take it into
 administrative time and then Jeff stood up and said
 before you do that we just want to do something else and basically Gary had
 Before I ever went and talked to me or anything had he had talked to
 David and he had talked to Jeff and said I think we're supposed to anointed her as a prophet and they all agreed and
 so he had like oil ready and
 and somebody had a towel, so there wouldn't be oil in the carpet.
  </li><li>Well, that was me.
 I was trying to be practical.
 Like you're about to pour oil over her feet.
 It's gonna go everywhere.
 Let's get some tarp.
 So we got tarp out that you were standing on
 and somebody else came up.
 Another prophetic guy in our church said,
 I just feel like the Lord's name don't use the tarp.
  </li><li>Right, let the oil get on the carpet.
  </li><li>So we were like, uh, okay.
  </li><li>So they anointed me and David kept saying,
 you're a heart prophet, a heart prophet.
 And, you know, just revealing the father's heart and whatever.
 And so I was like, oh, that's really cool.
 Anyway, I mean, I, I wept through the whole thing.
 But when I stepped away, like after they'd done my feet
 and all that kind of stuff, there was an oil mark
 in the shape of a big heart on the ground.
 A whole bunch of people came and took a picture of
 'cause it was like a perfect heart.
  </li><li>I can probably find a picture and put it in the show notes.
  </li><li>There you go.
  </li><li>So.
  </li><li>But none of that would have happened.
 Had you not actually believed God
 and reconciled in your heart first.
 John Paul Jackson has got this great phrase.
 He says, "If you have to tell people who you are,
 "they'll never believe you.
 "But when they tell you who you are,
 "you'll never convince them otherwise."
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So, you know, it was a no-brainer for us.
 When all these prophets are coming through,
 you're gonna hate your prophet,
 your prophet, your prophet, your prophet.
 And you're like, "Oh, I don't know."
 Like the rest of your community were like, "Ah, dah."
 And you know, it feels weird, doesn't it?
 Because you're like, "Am I the last person
 invited to this party.
 Yeah, I mean, it was funny with Chris because I remember getting in his face a little bit,
 like two days later, like trying to sort of get him to back down, which is quite funny.
 Good luck with that.
 Yeah.
 And I was like, well, why don't you define what you're talking about?
 Because I think we're probably talking about, we're thinking about two different things.
 And he's like, well, typically your profits going to raise other people, you know, raise
 prophetic teams, you know, blah, blah.
 And the different, he's like, have vision for the church.
 You probably get dreams for the church, you know, blah, blah.
 And I was like, oh, yeah, I do all those things.
 And Jeff just sat there and laughed.
 He was just like, yep, she does that.
 That's what she does.
 Jeff is good at laughing.
 It was, it was pretty funny, but it's, I think what's helpful is when you're
 stepping out into your destiny to be able to talk to other people that have gone
 ahead of you and bounce things off of them.
 Because if, if you can, like when you're going through things that you can't
 understand to be able to actually talk to other people that have gone in front of you and
 Just ask them is this normal
 Process with them go. Hey, this happens to me. Am I out to lunch? Mm-hmm. And then we go now. It's totally normal. Yeah
 It's really really really helpful. Yeah, that's amazing bit, but I love that whole process so important to believe God
 For you, you know what God's saying about you and
 And then watching everything unfold. I think that's amazing. It is amazing
 But I think we should wrap this bad boy up.
 All right.
 I've got three things for you.
