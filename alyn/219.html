<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>AJ Jones.
  </li><li>Yes, sir.
  </li><li>How the heck are you?
  </li><li>I'm so good.
  </li><li>This feels so weird.
  </li><li>It feels kinda great.
  </li><li>Hot casting is not like riding a bike.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>They say that, you know,
 well, you know the metaphor I'm trying to go for,
 but I feel so weird.
 And part of that is because we are in a brand new studio.
  </li><li>Yes.
 I am conscious that there's a bunch of cameras around me.
  </li><li>Yes, three to be precise.
  </li><li>I'm conscious about how stinking large I look on camera.
  </li><li>We're working on that.
  </li><li>Well, they see the camera at 10 pounds, so three cameras.
  </li><li>30 pounds.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>And we just said Thanksgiving.
  </li><li>Your math is pretty interesting right there.
  </li><li>No, I'm like going by visual.
  </li><li>Oh, okay.
  </li><li>You have visual accumulation.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>The other thing is it's quite cold in our basement,
 So when I speak to you, the warmth from the breath of my air
 steam on my glasses.
 So next time we record, we'll just go contact lenses.
 Yes.
 Mm.
 So we're recording this Black Friday.
 Yes.
 The day after Thanksgiving.
 Yep.
 And we're completely aware that we have not
 been on the air since April.
 Yes, it's been a very, very long break.
 Yeah, and we'll talk a little bit about the reasons
 for being off the air towards the end of it.
 And so we're having dinner with our family yesterday for Thanksgiving.
 And I thought it would be fun to get something out so that people who are
 driving back from Thanksgiving holiday, maybe vacation with their family.
 It's a cold vacation if you're with your family depends on your family.
 People who are driving home from being with their family would have something
 to listen to because one of the things I've really appreciated in these
 last couple of months is everybody who leaves comments or reaches out to us via
 text or Twitter or wherever saying when's the podcast coming back?
 Yes, lots of people.
 It's a regular question weekly.
 And so while we're not completely back, we're back a little bit.
 We're back with you today to accompany you and your transportation home.
 And maybe you're not listening to this coming home.
 Maybe you're just commuting to work or whatever, but we're back for this
 episode and our Dorset tones are in your ears.
 Yes.
 So, Ajit Jones with Thanksgiving, we had this interesting conversation with
 our kids where we realized we're not Americans yet.
 No, we will be soon though.
 God willing.
 Yes.
 And because of that, well, talk to me about the different Canadian and American
 Thanksgiving.
 I wasn't in Canada long enough, but here's my observation.
 It feels like Americans make more of a deal about their thanksgiving than
 Canadians do.
 Not a competition between these two amazing and equally wonderful countries.
 Are you worried?
  </li><li>Well, it is different.
 Well, the harvest comes in earlier in the north,
 so it's in October instead of November,
 'cause it is like a celebration of the harvest.
  </li><li>That wasn't the difference I noticed.
  </li><li>And it's similar food except that we don't over cook
 all of our vegetables in Canada.
 Other than that, the celebration part of it
 is way bigger down here.
  </li><li>Yes, it is.
  </li><li>Everything though is bigger down here.
  </li><li>It feels like we celebrate everything.
  </li><li>Thanksgiving is a dry run for Christmas,
 without presence.
  </li><li>It feels like it's like the first day
 of the Christmas holidays.
 Like everybody gets all their decorations out and it's, yeah.
  </li><li>But just being with friends,
 I noticed that they make a huge effort.
 Like they make as big an effort to be together
 as a family on Thanksgiving as they do perhaps at Christmas.
  </li><li>Yes, but I would say Canadians do that as well.
  </li><li>Okay, that's maybe the part I wasn't aware of.
  </li><li>Yes, it's a family holiday.
  </li><li>Yeah, a lot of my friends in Canada were international,
 so maybe I've not got the best sample.
 Yeah, no, Canadians would still get together.
 We just have Thanksgiving usually on a Sunday
 and you have the Monday off.
 So you'd have it, I guess, either the Sunday
 or the Monday of Thanksgiving.
 Yeah.
 It's not Thanksgiving.
 Our kids, we're not American yet.
 Our kids are Americanized.
 They've only ever known America really.
 Well, and two of our kids are American.
 True.
 And so they go to school, they're aware, I guess,
 from the climate of everybody else excited about Thanksgiving.
 And so they came to us and said,
 Why don't we do anything on Thanksgiving?
 And I was like, ah, okay.
 So they're like, can we do something on Thanksgiving?
 So we sat down with them and said, wouldn't it be fun?
 Because we're brand new Americans soon to be,
 let's create some Thanksgiving traditions.
 So I thought we'd start there
 and then we'd talk about what we're thankful for.
 But now, commercial break, why drink water?
  </li><li>Can't you just edit out the drinking of water
 or are we just trying to have a commercial break?
 (laughs)
 I have no product to advertise.
 So it was just a silence.
 We were talking to our kids and we wanted to come up with our family traditions for Thanksgiving.
 What have we come up with?
 Well, it seemed important to MJ that we have a feast.
 So we couldn't just have a normal dinner.
 It needed to be feast-like.
 And boy was it feast.
 We did feast.
 Yeah.
 Talk to us about your despising of turkeys.
 Well, I don't feel good after you, Turkey.
 I never do. I never have. So I don't love turkey. It dries out. It's hard to make it actually taste better than chicken because it doesn't.
 And then it makes me feel yucky. So I would just rather do chickens.
 When was the last time you had turkey? Because maybe it was a food intolerance or an allergy and maybe you're over it.
 I don't want to check. It's not a nice meat. It doesn't even matter.
 This is part of the problem we have in creating an authentic American Thanksgiving.
 So we did two roast chickens instead.
 We did.
 We did sweet potato casserole, which was literally a dessert.
 It is.
 Yes.
 Sweet potato cinnamon marshmallow butter butter.
 Oh, it was delicious.
 Uh, sugar.
 It was basically all the carbs because we had sweet potato mashed potatoes.
 Wice fried baked potatoes or whatever they would be called, like smash up potatoes.
 Then we had, you made biscuits.
 I did.
 You shocked me.
 You made biscuits.
 We had gravy.
 We had green beans.
 We had one of those bitter cabbages.
 Um, brussels sprouts, corn, corn, with cayenne pepper and broccoli, two
 roast chickens and a part of gin and buttery and gravy.
 The only thing that's important is the gravy.
 That's why I make all the food.
 But the other thing I lobbied for, which was received
 exception well, which I'll be, I learned from my barber.
 He said that in their family, they do Mexican food every other year.
 So next year for Thanksgiving, we'll do a Mexican feast where we'll make all of
 our own Mexican food because you do a killer salsa guacamole.
 I want to make enchiladas because they're my favorite.
 Tia wants brisket.
 So we'll do maybe some cornice, sada tacos.
 Mjoljice anything.
 I think that's going to be a great one.
 You excited about that?
 No, but why?
 Because it doesn't feel Thanksgivingy.
 Nothing is Thanksgivingy.
 We're brand new to this glory.
 No, that's not true.
 There are foods that are associated with Thanksgiving.
 We googled it.
 Like turkey.
 Yeah.
 More chicken, which is.
 Chicken literally doesn't.
 Turkey is better testing, tasting younger brother.
 I love how you're happy to deviate from the traditional meat of Thanksgiving.
 You're still having a foul, a bird.
 Yeah.
 -That is your roasted. -That is your roasted.
 -We'll do roast chicken. -No, you just said brisket.
 You can't turn it back.
 You said, "Carnet is sautte," and then some sort of strange.
 -I'm fine to do chicken tacos as well.
 I'll do chicken enchiladas. -It's not the same.
 Remember, we googled it, and it said you have to have green beans and corn
 and mashed potato.
 There's certain things that are Thanksgiving-
 -We can incorporate.
 Instead of green beans, have avocado, they're both green.
 It'll be fine with the next two. -I have concerns.
 -Then our kids wanted us to put up Christmas decorations,
 But there's just too much hassle.
 So we started to put Christmas decorations today.
 I cooked for four hours.
 I was like, I'm not putting up Christmas decorations today.
 Done.
 What else did they want us to tradition?
 We did the whole go around the table to see what you're thankful for.
 Yes, which is very cute.
 And then what else?
 Oh, we watched Home Alone.
 We did and we had apple pie.
 They wanted to make sure we got to have pie.
 They wanted pie and none of my weird children actually like pumpkin pie, which makes me sad.
 I don't like pumpkin pie.
 Oh, I love pumpkin pie.
 You know, what else is delicious turkey.
 Now, what are you gonna say onion pie?
 I'm gonna set that up.
 Leak pie, that's delicious too.
 Pumpkin pie is different.
 It's sweet.
 Lovely.
 My grandmother used to make the best pumpkin pie.
 Apple pie or nothing?
 Apple pie is like pumpkin pies, better looking younger brother.
 [laughs]
 Okay.
 Anyway, we're, I haven't really touched yesterday's.
 We're going around, what are we thankful for?
 And I thought I'd kick start off some feel-good feelings
 by talking about what are you thankful for, Age of Jones?
 What am I thankful for?
 I'm thankful for tons of things.
 I'm obviously thankful that I have you.
 Yeah, that's right. Let's talk more about me.
 You wonderful handsome Scottish piece of engineering you.
 I'm thankful for three wonderful children.
 I'm thankful for where we live, like Franklin, Tennessee.
 I love it.
 I love our church.
 I love our jobs.
 I mean, I could probably go on and on and on.
  </li><li>Well, that's the point with this episode.
 So do.
  </li><li>Oh, do you go on and on?
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause if you just summarize,
 this will be a very short episode.
  </li><li>Oh, I got you.
 I am thankful for Jeff and Becky
 that we get to work for and be friends with.
 Do you want to talk a little bit about the marriage retreat
 that we went on and what the leaders of the marriage retreat
 said to us about Jeff and Becky?
 You'd probably have to say that because I can't specifically
 remember-- you remember the specific wording of it.
 I do.
 All right.
 Well, why don't I tell that story?
 Yeah, why don't you tell that story?
 Thanks for setting that up so well.
 You're so welcome.
 So, Edgy and I went away on a marriage retreat
 earlier this year.
 And at the end of the week, we're talking to the facilitators
 and we're talking about marriages.
 talking that this is what they do several times a year. They're pastors normally, but
 on this for several weeks of the year, they lead these marriage retreats. And they were commenting
 on the state of marriages in ministry across America. And I was kind of alarmed by some of
 the statistics that they were sharing. Terrifying. Yeah. And I was just saying, oh, we just don't
 see that in our culture. And they said, well, we've been watching you all week, you need to go home,
 and you need to thank your senior pastors for the culture that they've created that promotes health,
 that prioritizes marriage and because you know what we see in you and what you talk about in the
 culture that you have in your church is largely unheard of and it just got me thinking about the
 like we often have people come and visit Grey Center and ask us how you know how we do what we do
 and really the the large answer to that is that Jeff and Becky have prioritized certain things in
 in our culture that has produced incredible benefits of which we are recipients of.
 Yeah.
 So things like prioritizing your family over ministry is really important.
 Prioritizing God over ministry, placing a high value on not having to have everything right.
 So you're allowed to make mistakes as huge.
 Yeah.
 Placing a high value on getting your heart healed, which is really, really beautiful.
 Yeah.
 creates a culture where like I love my job. Yeah, I do too. I don't I mean I don't want
 to do anything else. You know, I love that I get to get up in the morning and go do that.
 Right. But I could think of doing our jobs in other climates and it makes me shiver.
 I totally agree. I don't mean like weather climates. I just mean different corporate cultures.
 Yes. But hugely, hugely thankful. I don't want to interrupt your flow. What else are you thankful
 for? I'm thankful for my friends. We've been here 11 years now and I still have good friends
 from Toronto that I'm still really connected with and have rich relationship with, but
 now I have good friends here too. I'm just super thankful that I can have some real
 authentic relationship. What are you thankful for, babe? I'm thankful for everything that
 you said, I'm not trying to, I'm trying to avoid being repetitious.
 Yeah.
 And, but you know, I'm deeply thankful for our marriage.
 I'm deeply thankful for the fact that you absolutely love me.
 I feel like you love me.
 It's not a fact.
 It's something that we enjoy.
 We were talking to the kids yesterday about how do you know that
 daddy loves mummy?
 How do you know that mummy loves daddy?
 Like what are the things that you, their observations were adorable.
 But I love our marriage.
 Apparently we kiss and cuddle a lot.
 Apparently we have date night.
 That's one of their ways that they know that we love each other.
 Yeah.
 Then Amjia has got a spectacular description of how babies are made.
 Let's we'll spare you.
 I need to get more on and explain it.
 We went.
 We took the kids to the doctors a couple of days ago for their annual
 physicals and the conversation that my son had with his physician.
 Good job that they know us really, really well.
 But I was like, OK, that is one constant boy.
 about his shaky knowledge on the facts of life.
  </li><li>So funny.
  </li><li>But yeah, I'm super thankful for our marriage.
 I just love you, I love that you're phenomenal,
 I love that you're so patient with me.
  </li><li>I am, aren't I?
  </li><li>You really are.
 Like I think anybody who knows me,
 you know, must give you silent rounds of applause
 every time I leave the room.
  </li><li>Sometimes it's not even silent,
 it's just amazing that just kidding.
 (laughing)
 same things here, like I'm super grateful for a job. I've really been enjoying, I always enjoy
 teaching, but I've really enjoyed this year being with our students in ESO cell, which I love,
 I love every year. But there's something about this year where even in the summer,
 I began to get excited about meeting the students in the fall, and I've loved being with our students.
 They're just a great group by the first, second, or third year.
 I think I've noticed that I think I've fallen in love with each class and I think,
 this is like, I'm never going to love another class like this, you know, just the different
 dynamics or whatever. And then each year you fall in love again with this new group of
 eager students, you know, it's pretty awesome. Yeah, it is funny how each year differs,
 the personalities that, you know, you've got individual students that make up a collective
 feel of how the class feels. And that I, you know, I don't know, I'm super hungry to be
 with the students. I love being with them. I love hearing what they have to say. I love,
 I've really loved these last couple of weeks that I've been teaching.
 So good. Then I said this yesterday, I'm really grateful for the two year journey, probably,
 I've been on with an organization here called Sage Hill.
 I've really, really enjoyed the process.
 We talked about this a couple of episodes ago, but I've really enjoyed the process of therapy.
 Yeah.
 I think that has been one of my most rewarding experiences of doing therapy for me.
 You've done it for you, but it's caused an effect on all of us.
 Yeah.
 And that's been amazing.
 And I love that I didn't go for anybody else.
  </li><li>No, I know.
  </li><li>I went for me and got hungry for me.
 And then really the process of the therapy
 doesn't allow you really to do it for anybody else.
 'Cause if you start moving away from you,
 either you're a therapist or in the case of doing group therapy,
 your group will be like,
 "Ah, could you stay talking about you?"
 And I've loved that.
 I think I've, I was earlier this week
 And I was commenting how much I...
 True story, how much I genuinely love being with people and hearing their stories.
 Yeah.
 Which has not always been the case.
 That's true.
 I have loved being with some people and hearing some of their stories.
 But now I feel like an equal opportunity lover of all people's journeys.
 Question mark.
 Yeah.
 I'm not trying to be too extravagant.
 But that feels real.
 Yeah.
 And I, you know, I love that process.
 I think what I'd love to do is step back and think about what I've learned in therapy.
 Like, so right now I'm just reaping the benefits of therapy.
 I think I'd like to step outside a little bit and look at how I've learned or, you know,
 how I got to the benefits of that.
 I know high content player wants to think about the process even more.
 Oh, goody.
 And then else you're thankful for?
 I'm thankful for lots, baby.
 I just feel.
 I feel like I get up every morning and I think, wow, Lord, this is my life and I
 love it. And thank you so much. You know, yeah.
 I hate the buzz on the line. Can you hear the
 you just be thankful for the buzz in the line?
 I'm thankful I have a piece of software that will remove the audio buzz
 that I can hear my headphones that I have spent hours tracking down and can't.
 So I'm just going to isolate it in post production. So I'm grateful for really,
 really clever software engineers and audio engineers who write software to
 make my life a lot easier. Hey, I'm thankful that you've spent the amount of
 hours that you have down here so that we can start doing a podcast again.
 Yeah, let's talk a little bit. Thank you. I hear that. And I was not alone. I'm very
 grateful for the really smart people that God's putting our community to help me.
 Yes, so good. I'm looking at you, Cooper Ellen. I'm looking at you, Chris Law.
 Thank you for all the hours that you've spent trying to tweak everything.
 But let's talk a little bit about we haven't been on the air since April.
 Yes.
 And so let's talk a little bit about what happened there.
 Well, I think originally we just realized we had just too much on our plate and we were both
 exhausted.
 Well, we didn't realize that because we suck at identifying.
 Well, that's true. Somebody Jeff identified.
 And Shannon.
 That we needed to have a little break.
 Yeah.
 We had some dear friends who just came to sort of like,
 like, "Ah, hey, help me out with this."
 And I remember Jeff specifically
 and Shannon specifically sitting down going,
 "Okay, you guys look a little worn out."
 And probably the last thing that we're good at
 is assessing how we're doing in the real time.
  </li><li>Yeah, well, just keep running as hard as we can.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>And so Jeff challenged us as like,
 "What can you stop or what can you minimize?"
 Which was slightly funny,
 because it was the busiest work season,
 maybe since we've moved to Tennessee.
  </li><li>Yeah, we're like, "Well, or we could clone ourselves.
 That might be more realistic.
 I remember saying, which part of my job
 would you not like me to do?
 And then we realized one of the, one of the,
 so historically the way we've podcasted is
 we haven't done a video podcast.
 We have done a podcast in our upstairs,
 in a studio, an office upstairs.
 And we spent an awful lot of hours, many, many, many hours
 to get the room right, to get acoustic treatment right,
 where we could just sit down, pull out the laptop,
 hit record and everything was set up, ready to go.
 And then we would record a podcast.
 Yes.
 And the time between starting to record a podcast and uploading it was probably
 about four, maybe sometimes five hours worth of work.
 And so usually that would be Sunday, about seven o'clock, we'd sit down and record
 and somewhere about midnight, sometimes one o'clock, I'd upload a podcast.
 So it was ready for Monday.
 And largely that was doable.
 It was enjoyable that we love this whole
 Yes, except that you're getting almost no sleep
 right before going into teaching on a Monday.
 Yeah, very big week.
 And so we did that for almost 200 and something episode straight.
 Yes.
 And the story behind a start in podcasting is for another time.
 But one of the things that we originally felt God asked us to do
 was do video work.
 Yes.
 But we don't know how to do video work.
 No.
 So we started with audience thought we'll build from there.
 Yeah.
 But then we thought, OK, well, actually, we need to start doing video work.
 And so I tried to apply the same principle.
 Like when we started podcasting, we knew nothing.
 We didn't know the difference between a condenser and a dynamic microphone.
 I'd like to say I still don't, but I don't have to.
 I just sit here and talk.
 We didn't know anything.
 And you know, the fastest way to learn to do something is to do something and refine.
 And the benefit of podcasting every single week was it got easier.
 It was easier to be ourselves on the microphones.
 It was easier production wise.
 all of that got easier because we were doing it every week.
 Sure.
 So when it came to video, we were thinking, we have to, you know, you have to jump in somewhere.
 You'll never get good at doing video work unless you do video work.
 Right.
 And so that introduced a bunch of challenges.
 Yes.
 The first is we don't have a clue what we're doing with video.
 No.
 And it's far harder to fake video than it is audio.
 Yeah.
 Oh, yeah.
 Oh, yeah.
 For sure.
  </li><li>I consider. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Just unbelievable amount of things
 that I never even considered,
 like lighting, color of light, white balance,
 synchronization between audio and video,
  </li><li>I still have a kids to do those things.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Oh, just huge amounts of things.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so what we did is we built a video studio
 and the idea was that instead of recording upstairs
 in our studio, we'd record downstairs
 in this kind of purpose-built video studio.
 Video studio sounds way glamorous.
 It's in our unfinished basement.
 We've taken over a corner.
 And like right now, I'm sitting in front of
 third brown, blue, or drape.
 Yeah.
 And you know, overhead is that pink insulation.
 Insulation.
 That's like hanging down.
 So we've worked in towards a pretty new studio.
 Sure.
 But and what we thought is, well, we'll just take
 a normal podcast process, just move it on the stairs,
 add a couple of cameras, and it should be simple.
 except I'm either, I think I'm blessed with.
 No, I don't wanna say, I count it as a blessing.
 I have fairly, how would you say, rigorous?
  </li><li>Standards?
  </li><li>Standards, I want things to be done well.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And the quality of audio.
 So you have a high value and excellence.
  </li><li>I really do.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So the rich, caramelly audio that you hear in my voice
 is because the microphone that I'm speaking into
 is about three inches away from my mouth.
 And the microphones were using a really good quality,
 radio quality microphones.
 What are you looking at yours?
  </li><li>It's not three inches, it's much less than that.
  </li><li>Okay, two inches?
  </li><li>Yes.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I'm sorry, details, details.
  </li><li>I'm looking at the monitor over there and I'm like,
 I don't, you know, I'm a metric person.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So when we switched to doing--
  </li><li>How many centimeters would that be then?
  </li><li>I mean, I couldn't let it lie.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Okay, sorry metric person, go ahead.
 Thank you.
 Anyway, needless to say, switching to an audio where now you have to consider video,
 like it doesn't look good to have microphones in front of people.
 Ironically, this is what we've gone back to.
 So we had these really nice mics to pick up our audio.
 But because the vast majority of our audience are listening to our podcast as an audio podcast,
 not a video podcast, we were sacrificing audio sound.
 Yeah.
 Good sound.
 Sound quality.
 Yeah.
 with that. And so it took hours and hours and hours to try and in post
 production, get the audio sounding as good as it does now. And then after like
 several weeks of that, I thought this is ridiculous. Let's just move to using
 the microphone to currently using, which looks less good on video. But right now
 we're not doing a show per se, we're just doing a podcast. And so there's
 enough people on YouTube who are doing this and it works out really, really
 well. Okay, they have their headphones on. Yeah, they do. And the reason
 need your headphones on is so that you know when you've done that.
 Yeah, so you can hear when you go off. Right. And so when we have guests in, it helps as
 well. So anyway, all that is a long way of explaining that one of the reasons we've
 been off the air is we have been spending months trying to get video and audio quality
 that we're happy with. And don't don't even get me started with things called lots and
 camera color and camera grading. Oh, I won't. Okay. Yeah. Well, funny you should mention
 that. The whole point in saying that is what turned out to be a let's say a four hour return
 on investment. Like each episode takes four hours was getting up between like 10 and 15 hours.
 And I just couldn't find that in our week to do that. And you know, I want to have it on a weekly
 schedule. And so we couldn't do that. So that kind of went by the wayside till I could find some
 people who could help me. And so part of the reason we're doing this is we've rebuilt the studio.
 Yeah. We've invested in some different technology and we're going to try our hand at like how
 how quickly can we do turnaround on video podcast? Yes. To get things out on a regular schedule.
 Right. So we're checking the feasibility with this wonderful Thanksgiving podcast.
 So one of the reasons we stopped podcasting was our boss and our close friends were like,
 okay, you need to slow down a little bit. Yes. And that's because also we started three services
 the Grey Center. So behind the scenes, a lot of this year has been some of the busiest time
 at Grey Center. Yes. Amazing. But so busy. But it's required an awful lot of energy and
 time, which we haven't been able to devote to podcasting. Then there's part of it is my
 desire for things to be done well, which slows down the process. And then part of it is,
 I'm maybe a little self-conscious that it feels like we've already talked about everything we
 we already know, we have over 200 episodes.
 And I'm like, is there really a demand for us to talk about stuff we've already
 talked about again?
 Right.
 And I guess so maybe question mark, because when I think about most of the people
 who I listen to on podcast is they're just talking again and again and again about
 the same things, like Dave Ramsey is still talking about how to get people out of
 debt.
 Right.
 And that's why you're listening to him.
 Right.
 He's still talking about like the seven baby steps.
 He's still talking about this, that the next.
 Yeah.
 So maybe that's less of a problem.
 I wonder if we could do something where we ask for some input on some topics that people
 would like to hear about as well.
 Yeah.
 But when we do that and people ask for input on topics, large
 acting point to our back catalog and say, yes, we've talked about that.
 Right.
 But maybe we talked about it more because we're constantly learning about things.
 Here's the thing.
 I have a deep love for this medium.
 I have a deep love for podcasts and I have a deep love for video.
 I wonder what my stats say about how much time I spend on YouTube.
 Like, I think YouTube is just such an amazing.
 I can't even imagine what they say.
 Babe, shut off your phone and go to bed.
 Babe, shut off your phone.
 Babe, for the love, go to sleep.
 This is going to watch one more video.
 Yeah.
 See, I've missed this therapeutic part.
 Where do you get me to confess my sin public?
 Yeah, do you want to admit to anything right now?
 I don't want to admit to keeping your wife awake at night.
 No, I'd rather talk about the five volume of novels
 that you've been working your way through.
 At least it's reading.
 It's not like something where it's keeping you awake at night.
 Don't you need lights on to read?
 Listen, OK.
 The other thing, the other exciting thing is one of the things that people have
 been asking about for longer than they should do is the Finding Father video
 course they have.
 And the reason the Finding Father video course never got finished is
 I couldn't do it myself.
 I wasn't thrown on you.
 It was clearly in my camp.
 Okay, but just trying to do everything else.
 So part of the reason that we stopped podcasting was so that I could get the
 Finding Father video course done.
 Yes.
 And I'm pleased to announce drumroll.
 I can't feel my hands.
 I'm so cold.
 Please don't answer the Finding Father video podcast is done.
 It has been beta tested by several of our wonderful patrons.
 Thank you.
 So the Finding Father video course is done.
 AJ Jones talked to us about the Finding Father video course, where it came
 about what it is and how people can learn more about it.
  </li><li>Well, it's the video course that really goes along
 with the book, but it can be done with or without the book.
 And so it is all of the teaching,
 all the father-heart teaching that goes along with,
 you know, the plan of the book, basically.
  </li><li>So each chapter of the book, you're doing a live teaching?
  </li><li>Yes.
 And so there's 12 of them that are about an hour long.
 So it's a deep dive into God's heart for you.
  </li><li>Well, the beautiful thing is,
 people get to work through it at their own pace.
 It's an e-course, so you just sign up
 and you can work through it, like I said, at your own pace.
 Instead of watching 12 hours of video in one sitting,
 each of the classes are broken and down into bite-size chunks
 of video, there's exercises that you are leading people through.
 There's journaling exercises, there's ministry prayers.
 It was all recorded in a beautiful studio
 with our friend Patricia King down in Phoenix, Arizona.
 And we've, like I said, chopped up into bite-sized pieces
 so that you can work through at your own pace.
 It's ideal for personal study.
 We are working on a teachers edition of it,
 which would be better for people who want to run it
 as a course.
 But if you've read the book and you're like,
 "Man, I would love more revelation on the Father Heart."
 I'd highly encourage you, as you know,
 AJ is a phenomenal teacher on Finding Father.
  </li><li>Oh, thanks, babe.
  </li><li>Or the whole topic of Father Heart.
 You're just amazing in that.
 And if you want to learn more, go to Ellen and AJ.com.
 That's a L Y N and AJ.com.
 And you can learn more about the course there.
 Yeah, perfect.
 All right.
 Well, I'm so happy it's out, babe.
 I'm really excited.
 I'm really happy.
 It's we haven't launched it publicly, but it is up.
 So it's up for the podcast listeners.
 It's up for the podcast listeners.
 And then probably in January, we'll do a big marketing
 portion talk about it.
 But if you would like a sneak preview of it, go ahead, make a great Christmas
 present for those of you who are thinking about, Oh,
 And what am I going to get so and so for Christmas if they've read the book?
 This is a great addition to it too.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Well, thank you for joining us on your journey, possibly home from Thanksgiving.
 Hope it was good and not traumatic.
 Maybe we need to pray for people.
 You, I mean, sure, you mean, like, trim trauma, like how much food they ate or like
 family trauma or like a combination of both?
 I think it's a combination of both.
 I don't know if it's a because I don't have an American family.
 I don't know if it's a trope or a meme.
 You know, I'm going home for Thanksgiving.
 It's going to be a nightmare because my brother's going to be there.
 My sister-in-law is going to be there or my great uncle always gets drunk and talks about, you know, whatever.
 Yeah. OK, thank you. Sorry.
 Do you want to pray for?
 Continue on.
 I'm just wondering if we need to break off shock and trauma off of people.
 Father, I thank you for each person that is listening to this podcast today.
 And Lord, I ask that you would wash us clean of anything we picked up.
 through the Thanksgiving hangout with whomever we were with, anything that discouraged us or
 anything that sort of stuck to us, Lord, I ask that you would wash it off. And Lord, we thank you
 for family and for friends and for just the wonderful things that you do through life and
 community and Lord, I ask that you would bring healing to every family represented by a person
 listening today. In Jesus name, amen. Thanks so much for joining us. Thanks for listening.
 If you want to watch the video and count how many times I accidentally picked my nose before
 I was conscious, there was cameras here. And see where he's actually looking when he's supposed
 to be talking to me. It's weird. I know it's so much. I like to know what I'm talking to you.
 You're like looking all over the place. I'm like, what are we doing? What are we doing here?
 It's my first time. I can't remember how to do this. I'm just so distracted by you. You're just
 just so handsome. I'm just looking straight at you.
 If you want to witness the glory of my silver fox hair,
 it's true.
 And my beard.
 Yeah.
