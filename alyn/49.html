<p> AJ Jones. Yes.<br/>
 How are you, cuteness? I'm good. Thank you and yourself.
 I'm fantastic. Tell me the highlight of your week.
 The highlight of my week has been certain visitors that we've had.
 Yeah, we have had, if you were listening last week, you already know that we've had
 been in Sir Jackson all the way from Toronto. Yes.
 But they hail further than Toronto. They hail from Both.
 Well, only one of them does. Well, he's kind of from Both. It's true.
 It's close to Both. No one's ever heard of Shaspry.
 Sorry Shaftesbury people.<br/>
 And thus you've just incited a riot from our Shaftbury listeners.
 So it's like some sort of step cousin.
 Yes. They're both in time, seriously,<br/>
 on school and then they stayed on for a week to have vacation,
 which was wonderful. Yes.<br/>
 When people are on vacation, I'd like to say that they cause us to stumble
 and eat food we wouldn't normally eat, but let's be honest,
 we eat the same food all the time.<br/>
 I don't.<br/>
 Come on.<br/>
 I don't.<br/>
 Seriously, you never have coffee from Honest Roasters.
 I have coffee.<br/>
 You never have acai bowls.<br/>
 I don't have the cronuts.<br/>
 You always have the cronuts.<br/>
 You're smoking dope.<br/>
 I do not.<br/>
 I would like to clarify that I do not smoke dope.
 I have the acai bowls.<br/>
 I have the coffee, but I've been very good to not have the donuts.
 Okay.<br/>
 You.<br/>
 Oh, sorry.<br/>
 Cronuts.<br/>
 Well, it actually can't come on cronuts because cronuts is a registered trademark.
 So whatever they are hundred layer donuts
 hundred layer of yummy<br/>
 Sarah Jackson am I right in thinking that this trip was your first experience of a
 Hundred layer donut. Yes. How would you describe them to our listeners who've had the misfortune of never experiencing them?
 And it was a spiritual experience<br/>
 these these hundred layer donuts are<br/>
 unlike anything I've ever eaten before and
 You know true confession. I've already Googled to see if I can find them in Toronto when we return
 We've had them not every day since we've been here every day since you had your first one every day since we had the first one
 And I've realized we've needed to start ordering one for a river as well
 Yes, even though she doesn't eat them even though she doesn't eat them because she may she may and who would want to starve their own child
 No, I not me right right you're a great parent and in fact Alan
 Sarah did say today that should I arrive to visit any point without box of cronuts with me, I may be turned back at the border.
 Will cameras let us bring in pastry pastry.
 They're not like an evil nation of course so let isn't.
 Well you know you're not going to bring food across the border.
 Yes but just give the customs guy one of them and you're in.
 All right we're going to start smuggling business across the border.
 Crunette smugglers.<br/>
 We ate many, many, many, many great places this week.
 But I did want to get your opinion on the Sanos because to my memory, we haven't talked about the Sanos Italian bakery.
 Or pizzeria. I think they call themselves a bakery, but they're a pizza place.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And I think we've talked about it on the podcast.
 I thought we had.<br/>
 But...<br/>
 Well, even if we have, it's worthy of talking about it again.
 Sarah, we should probably get Ben on here to talk about pizza, but he's downstairs.
 Tell us about your pizza experience.<br/>
 It was it was of Italian quality.<br/>
 It was and have you been to Italy?<br/>
 Several times.<br/>
 We love pizza.<br/>
 We love Italy.<br/>
 We love Italian pizza.<br/>
 We love good food.<br/>
 And this checked all of those boxes.<br/>
 And it should taste like Italian pizza because
 the Italian buffalo mozzarella is flown in every week.
 And then the flour is shipped in from Italy.
 and the three ovens which weigh 10,000 pounds each were shipped in from Italy.
 So it's about as authentic as you're going to get without going to Italy.
 It's true. It was fairly mind-blowing. And really, I don't even like pizza,
 but I like to sign those pizza. And she ate a lot of pizza because I was sharing pizza.
 Slow down, sir. Well, we did not bring you on the show to talk about food.
 to very generously agreed to come back on, talk about dreams. Sarah was teaching this
 week on our School of Supernatural Life, All About Dreams. In fact, you have taught on
 every single school since this inception. Wow, can't believe it. Love it.
 Tell us how you got into dreams because you're very passionate about it. Where did that journey
 begin? I can remember dreams I had as a little kid, symbolic dreams, intense dreams from
 you know, four or five years old, all growing up,
 we just remember these intense dreams.
 And I remember talking to people about them.
 I grew up in a charismatic church,<br/>
 and I don't remember anyone ever once saying
 that God spoke through dreams today.<br/>
 And when I was 19 years old, I had Mark Vercliff speak
 on hearing the voice of God.<br/>
 And he just did a very small kind of section
 on just saying, oh, well, God speaks through dreams today.
 When I heard that it just ignited something in me.
 I was mind blown.<br/>
 I was like, why has no one ever told me about this before?
 I wanna know everything about it.<br/>
 So I started reading everything I could.
 I started listening to every teacher,<br/>
 every Christian resource out there.<br/>
 'Cause the only stuff I'd ever heard<br/>
 was sort of new age stuff or psychoanalysis.
 And I thought if God is speaking through dreams today,
 I wanna be hearing what he's talking about.
 It is an interesting dichotomy really, that the Bible is filled with dreams.
 Yes.<br/>
 And the Bible is filled with God speaking through dreams.
 Yes.<br/>
 And you know, the first five chapters of the New Testament got five dreams in them.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I mean, really significant dreams that basically the life of Jesus depended on Joseph listening
 to the dreams.<br/>
 So there isn't really any debate amongst theologians that God spoke through dreams in
 the Bible.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 how we've disconnected that reality. When I say we, I grew up in the church and I think
 today in the church circles that I might have moved in, it would be preposterous to imagine
 that God speaks today through dreams. Yes. So did you have any hurdles, intellectual
 or otherwise to this? Or you were just lit on fire with it? I think for me, I was lit
 on fire. I heard it resonated with me. I thought I've always known that there was
 significance to the dreams I've had and I want this. I feel like it's something that's
 been held back from me and I want it. I realize a lot of people may have hurdles to believing
 God speaks in their dreams partly because of how our culture values or doesn't value
 dreams. So for many people, they've been raised in a cultural environment which says dreams
 are not important and they only come after eating too much pizza.
 which coincidentally enough, we did eat a lot of pizza today.
 So maybe tonight we will have dreams, you know, disconnected from anything else except
 for the large amount of pizza we had for lunch.
 But I would like to say I didn't have a large amount of pizza, I had a normal amount of
 pizza.<br/>
 We were all there.<br/>
 It might be normal for an NFL linebacker.
 Hey.<br/>
 That's a sports analogy, people.<br/>
 I just made an American sports analogy.
 Do you understand it?<br/>
 No, I'm hoping that the linebackers are the big guys.
 Is that right?<br/>
 I don't know.<br/>
 I think the person who ate an entire pizza by himself shouldn't be talking.
 I'm an NFL linebacker.<br/>
 I'm an athletic guy.<br/>
 I'm the few in my body.<br/>
 I can finish that.<br/>
 On the topic of dreams, one of my favorite verses has long been Job 33 verse 14, "For
 God may speak in one way or in another, yet man does not perceive it in a dream and a
 vision of the night, while deep sleep falls upon men while slumbering in their beds.
 He opens the ears of men and seals her instruction.
 So it's clear, as we already talked about, that God spoke to people in dreams in the
 Bible.<br/>
 Why are dreams so stinking confusing?<br/>
 Like you would think if God's going to speak in a dream, it would be really, really clear.
 Why does he wrap things up in riddles?
 Because God loves mystery.<br/>
 He loves to play hide and seek with us, but hide and seek in the way that we play hide
 and seek with River.<br/>
 hides something in plain sight and she knows where you've hidden it and she's so excited
 to find it. And you know, it's I think it's his delight to be found by us. He's a God
 who speaks in mystery and parables. When you look at Jesus and the New Testament, he spoke
 in parables time after time after time because he wanted to see if we had ease to hear. If
 we had hungry hearts rather than just delivering on a plate saying, will you pursue me? Will
 you pursue understanding and dreams invite us to enter deeper into relationship with God? They are
 not dreams are not a slot machine side of God. They are an introduction, a call to intimacy, to know
 him more because as we know him more, we will understand the mysteries of him more.
 Can you give me an example of top your head of a dream that God spoke to you?
 That at first you didn't understand, but after it was interpreted, you were like, "Oh God, that's
 brilliant." Well, a few years ago, I had a dream that I was at a wedding and attending as a guest,
 and as I came to the top of the aisle, you know how you often have ushers who escort you down to
 your seat. Prince William was the usher who was escorting me to my seat and in the dream
 I was deeply attracted to him. Just every part of me was drawn towards him in attraction
 and desire and he led me to my seat which was right at the front and I was a little unsure
 about whether that was my place, whether I should kind of be at the front but he sat
 beside me and we were sort of, you know, talking and I was just feeling so attracted
 to him. And then they made an announcement at the wedding and they said, you know, for
 the people close to the bride, we are inviting you forward into sort of a very special sort
 of area so that you can really, you know, see and be part of what's happening. And I
 didn't, in the dream, I felt like, oh, that's probably not me. I don't think I should go
 forward or I don't want to step out of place. And in the dream, Prince William was just like,
 yes, it's for you. And he drew me forward. And we walked into this new area. And as we sat on
 these seats, he said, oh, let me introduce you to my father, Prince Philip. And I met Prince
 Philip and was chatting to him. And then the dream ended. And when I woke up, what was so vivid for
 for me was that sense of attraction and drawing and desire for him.
 Now, let me reassure you that in real life I do not have deep desire toward Prince William.
 I really like Ben, my husband.<br/>
 And as I was pondering the dream, I began to think about it.
 And I realized, of course, that Prince William was representing Jesus in the dream.
 He's a prince.<br/>
 My attraction desired toward me.<br/>
 him and who was his father, of course, father God.
 And God spoke to me and at the time we were facing a decision where we'd be asked to
 take a significant position of leadership.
 And I was somewhat unsure and sort of feeling a little insecure about it.
 Like, oh, I don't want to put myself forward.
 I don't want to be stepping into it if God is not leading the way.
 And that dreams was such a clear picture that it's not me putting myself forward, but Jesus,
 the one leading me into a place of intimacy, a place of prominence, and that him and his
 father are going to be seated beside me in that new thing.
 That's amazing, of course.<br/>
 That's very cool.<br/>
 You were at a wedding and those were closest to the bride, the bride of church, the church.
 I'll spoke to the context you were speaking of.
 Exactly.<br/>
 Amazing.<br/>
 I love it.<br/>
 for many, many years and studying dreams.
 Do you find that there are repeating or common dreams
 that over the years of people are like,
 "I've had a dream, can I share it with you?"
 Do they fall into groups or patterns?
</p><ul>
  <li>Yes, in many ways there are,
 I think there are common dreams that people have
 as they face similar situations in life.
 Sometimes they're based around common themes,
 sometimes they are common scenarios being played out.
 For example, bathroom dreams.
 A lot of people talk about, oh, I had this dream
 and I was going to the bathroom, but it was in public.
 Everyone was looking at me, the walls were glass.
 There were people around me,
 or things were, I was in the bathroom.
 And like, what is that?
 Is that a weird dream?
 Why am I dreaming about the bathroom?
 I think one of the things when we look at symbolic dreams is understanding what is this a symbolic
 representation of? What do we do in this room, in this place, in our lives? Because symbolism
 is this huge, sort of intricate, complex gathering of pictures and symbols that each of us individually
 have acquired that is also referenced by the Bible. And, you know, what do we do in the
 bathroom, we get rid of waste, we get rid of the toxins that are in our body.
 So if someone that comes to me and is sharing a bathroom dream, I'm wondering,
 okay, what are you in a season of cleansing?
 Are you in a season of cleansing where everybody around you is really aware of it?
 You know, what is God wanting to kind of get rid of in your life that maybe is a
 toxin that is holding you back in some way?
 I just wish people could see your arms as you're talking because you're so
 expressive that if it was a video podcast, they would get an idea of just my
 octopus arms, the octopus arms, and if we did a video podcast, we'd have to be
 dressed. Our viewership would drop dramatically. We won't do this to you people.
 We love you. We'd also have the tidier room. Yes. Yeah. I know this is an enormous topic,
 But are there basic steps that you have found through your study for dream interpretation?
 I mean, I know the answer to that is probably a podcast in and of itself, but have a stab at that.
 Yes, gosh, where to begin. There's still many things and I want to tell you it all so that you're
 not just operating out of very small awareness. But firstly, I would say that there are three
 resources to our dreams. God speaks in our dreams just as he speaks in our thoughts.
 So truth dreams are heart speaks messages to us in our dreams and the enemy will
 sometimes send dreams to try and throw us off course. And when we approach our
 dreams really what we're wanting to be doing is connecting with the spirit of
 truth and the Holy Spirit is the bring of truth and he's the one who brings
 clarity and understanding. So if you are wanting to understand your dreams,
 pursue hearing God's voice, start asking Him, "Father, I want to understand my
 dreams with you. Speak to me about my dreams." If you know how to journal your
 dreams and start asking Him questions, like why this and why not that?
 Primarily, one of the first things to look at would be, are you in the dream
 active and emotionally involved. When you look in the Bible, the kind of
 outstanding feature for if the dream is a personal dream would be that you as
 the dream are active and involved in the dream. So if you're in that dream, then
 that dream is for you and about you and about your heart. And that's a
 helpful foundation to start from. Most of us have probably had dreams where we're
 like, "Wow, you were my dream and you were weird. You might have problems. I dreamt weird
 things about you." And we so quickly leap to that understanding or lack of understanding
 of like, "Oh, my dream was about you." And really, that dream was about us and about
 our heart and that person in the dream represented a part of who you are.
 Wow. So it's a good question to ask, like, if somebody turns up in your dream, is a good
 question to ask what does that person mean to you? Would that be an unfolding?
 That would be an excellent question. So what does this person mean to me?
 If someone shared their dream with me, I would be asking, who is that person? What is
 describe them in five or ten words? What is their job in life? So sometimes a person is representing
 It may be it's their job role, you know, their administrative, their creative, their passionate,
 their pastoral, their prophetic, you know, who are they?
 Who were they represented to you in their life?
 One of the dreams that one of your listeners, Justin sent in, is a great example of this.
 He had two dreams, the first one where he was with Sean Bowles at his house, sitting
 his kitchen table, chatting, enjoying each other's company. And he asked me what I wanted
 from him. And I said, I want to travel with you. I want to do prophetic ministry. I want
 to be your intern and be mentored by him. And he said, that's great. Let's do it. The
 second dream I was with Alan A.J. Jones, the two of you.
 Were we eating pizza? It doesn't say that you would eat pizza.
 I bet we were though. But you may have been you are.
  </li><li>Stay on targets.
  </li><li>Stay on targets.
  </li><li>Oh wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
 will there be cronuts at the end of this podcast for me?
  </li><li>No, but tomorrow morning I could take you to get another one.
  </li><li>I love you.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>I shall continue.
 And he was sitting at the kitchen table
 with you enjoying conversation.
 It was a great time of fellowship.
 So, you know, my first question would be,
 okay, who are these people?
 What do they represent to you?
 You know, do you know them personally?
 If not, what are the primary things about their life?
 From looking at this dream,
 what I would begin to see are some two common things.
 In both dreams, you're sitting at the kitchen table.
 What do you do in the kitchen?
 You prepare food in general.
 So my feeling would be that this is a dream speaking
 of preparation that God is wanting to bring you in,
 into in your life.
 And these people, Sean Bowles and AJ,
 represent the type of training and the type of preparation
 that God wants to do in you.
 And, you know, my, I would wanna ask you questions,
 Justin, if you were sitting here,
 because I don't want to be the person
 putting the interpretation upon you,
 because the interpretation needs to resonate
 with your spirit and with the Holy Spirit within you.
 But I, you know, my initial guess would be,
 is it something to do with the prophetic,
 Sean, both Al Naeje carry the prophetic in an incredible way.
 And so I would begin to wonder is God leading you into a time of training, a time of preparation
 as a leader and in the prophetic.
 And if so, I would start asking him, show me the opportunities.
 I don't really think necessarily that these are going to be dreams that come to pass,
 but these are dreams that are symbolic dreams.
 These people representing something to you.
 Can I ask you a question about that? What percentage of dreams are literal and what percentage of dreams are perhaps more symbolic?
 So, you know, I find it interesting you're saying, I don't think this is literally going to happen, like you're literally going to be mentored by Sean,
 or you're literally going to hang out with Helen A.J. but rather it's symbolic in nature.
 So, how do you tell a difference between whether symbolic or literal and what percentage, I'm sorry, through a bunch of questions, are you all at once?
 Okay, lots of great questions. On average, 95% of your dreams are going to be for you
 and about you. 5% of your dreams are going to be about other people and are going to
 be prophetic, literal, coming to past dreams, dreams of the future that happen in your
 life. Now, without chatting to Justin, I wouldn't be able to find out if he has a history of
 dreams that come to pass. Right.
 know that would obviously perhaps alter my understanding of whether this is a God coming
 to past dream or not. But my kind of sort of baseline jumping off place would be just
 in your in this dream, your interacting this dream, this dream is about you, about your
 heart and most of those dreams would be symbolic dreams. So, you know, I would start with that
 understanding and if God unfolds anything more out of it, will you embrace that then?
 But generally speaking, most dreams are symbolic in nature.
 Yes.
 Right.
 Okay, brilliant.
 You know, you, that was great.
 One of the things I love about having dreams interpreted by you and you've
 throughout the years that I've known you, I mean, I even remember in 2003,
 I began having dreams about AJ.
 You were in authority over me.
 I was a student on the school.
 You were a staff member.
 You were also AJ's best friend.
 And how ironic that I'm having dreams about AJ.
 It was so confusing to my heart because I felt like God said, "You're not going to be meeting
 your wife this year and yet I'm having these dreams that are causing my heart to wake up."
 And you were so brilliant at not saying, "This is where your dream means," but rather you use the
 same techniques you see Jesus in the New Testament of just asking questions and allowing the revelation
 of the dream to percolate in the dreamer's heart. And you would draw out such a gift that you have,
 Sarah. We asked a bunch of our, well, we put it on Twitter and said, "Hey, we're going to have Sarah
 Jackson, if you have a dream you'd like interpret it. We go on an overwhelming response of dreams
 and we ask Sarah to just pick some. So do you have another dream that you want to read out?
 Yeah, I have a few. I'm so sorry everybody that I couldn't go through them all. Some of you sent
 wonderful, intense, interesting dreams. And to be honest, all of them I felt like had meaning and
 are worth pursuing, worth asking God to unfold revelation for you. So I've just picked some
 snippets here, partly because they're themes and common themes that hopefully will bring
 understanding to a wider group of you.
 Michelle, Michelle Anderson, you sent in a dream and there's several really interesting
 things about the dreams that you sent in.
 Basically, over the past three years, you said that you'd had a reoccurring dream that
 your driver's license was stolen from your wallet.
 And you felt sad and violated that someone would steal
 from you.
 And two weeks ago, you had a similar dream,
 except this time your driver's license
 and two major credit cards were missing.
 And in your dream, you're telling people
 how sad, frustrated you are.
 And firstly, if you have a reoccurring dream,
 that is a message dream.
 And I would encourage you to pursue understanding of that dream.
 A dream that comes many times with a very, very similar theme is a message that either
 God or your heart is trying to communicate with you.
 And it is worth asking the Holy Spirit to unveil and reveal the mystery of it.
 in regards to having your driver's license stolen, I would begin to ask, "What does
 that represent?
 Let's think of that as a symbol.
 Your driver's license, it proves your identity, it gives you privileges, it shows other people
 you are who you say you are."
 And if you look at that as a metaphor, I would begin to ask, "Are there areas in your life
 that you feel some of your identity, whether it's your ideas, your passions, your convictions,
 your ability to say yes or no, is being taken from you, is being, you feel unable to, you know,
 something about you is being taken away. And in some ways, I would say this may be a warning
 dream, trying to show you a dynamic or a pattern that is going on in your life. Primarily, I would
 say is well, you who you are is valuable. You know, you are an incredibly valuable person.
 And I would ask the Holy Spirit, is there some part of my life or my identity that is
 under threat? You know, you use the word violated. That's a strong word. And, you know, that
 when someone steals from us, when someone takes from us, you know, it's not just speaking
 about your driver's license, but it could be speaking about, you know, emotionally or
 spiritually or physically and I would be asking the Holy Spirit, you know, what's going on
 in my life? Is there any way that I feel like this in my life? Is there any way this is happening?
 And I've been unaware of something that you would like to show me.
 That's amazing. All right, give us another listener's dream.
 Okay, Molly, Molly had a really interesting house dream. Molly, you actually had three
 dreams all with the same theme. The first one was house dream and Molly I just feel
 like these dreams are dreams that are important to listen to. The first one you
 drove up to a large two to three story house it's old, stately, recently
 renovated. It's painted a dark mahogany in the painters are painting thin red
 lines along the trim. You notice it's really dark and unusual color scheme but
 it's striking and you realize it's your house.
 As you're absorbing how you feel about that,
 you feel a bit overwhelmed and impressed
 and are getting used to the house striking it is.
 And as you walk around the back,
 a neighbor comes to congratulate you on the work
 and asks where are they gonna work on the back
 and as she has to look at it every day
 and as you turn the corner in the back of the house,
 is blown off, splintered and you're wondering
 why are the painters painting trimmed
 on the front when the house is destroyed.
 Then you have two more dreams,
 one in which you're having your haircut
 and they basically, the front is intact,
 but when you turn around, it's all hacked off at the back.
 And then a third dream, a friend of a friend
 from a church in middle school
 is cutting your back with a razor
 and you're horrified as you realize it is intentional
 and you have hit huge razor cuts
 all over your back and sides.
 Now sometimes symbolism can be pretty intensive.
 It can be a little kind of, whoa,
 that what on earth does that mean?
 It's overwhelming, it's intense,
 it can almost feel a little bit scary.
 But when dreams come with the same theme,
 like I said before, you want to look at them.
 And Jesus talked in Matthew about
 using the symbolism of our lives being like a house
 built on the rock or built on the sand.
 And in dreams, our houses will often represent our lives
 and who we are, which is so interesting to think about.
 When you look at a house, what does it look like
 on the inside, on the outside?
 Is it dark?
 Is it light?
 Or things like that.
 When you think about this being a symbolic
 representation of you.
 And a few things, I'd love to ask you questions,
 about this because it's such interesting dreams. And you know there are several different ways
 or several different roads you could go down in interpretation and which is why it's so important
 to ask questions because it's not me being having all knowledge putting it on you but it's me hoping
 to draw out what is in your heart. One of the first things that really struck me was as you
 realized the house was yours, you know, it felt, I wondered if you're in a season where you are
 embracing who God has made you to be. I mean, when I don't really know you at all, Molly, but
 when I look at the description of this house, it would seem to me, you know, I would just, you know,
 throw it out there that you are probably a strong, dynamic, bold woman who is not necessarily
 led a conventional life necessarily that you have, you know, there's an intensity of life in you.
 And I, you know, I would wonder, and I would ask you if I was chatting to you now,
 sort of are you in a season where you are accepting and embracing the identity God has given you?
 Now, the reoccurring theme in these three dreams is of the back, something at the back
 being sort of cut off or you know the house, back of the house being blown off. And so I'd
 want to ask you, you know, potentially there are different directions you could go in in
 interpretation and try to discover the meaning of this dream. You know, sometimes if there's
 things happening at the back, it might be a message to watch your back. But I would looking
 at these dreams, I might, I might ask you, you know, is there something either in your past or
 or something that you're carrying in yourself
 that is an area of maybe wounding or pain
 that is in some ways causing you a vulnerability.
 In the back, it's sort of an open area for you.
 I would ask, in the third dream with the razor blades,
 it talks about a friend of a friend
 from church in middle school,
 what happened in that season of your life?
 Is that reference giving you a timeframe
 for something that God wants to speak to you about in this.
 Now, God is not intimidated by areas in us that need work,
 that he is full of hope and life for us.
 And at one point in the house dream,
 you say, someone says,
 "When are they gonna begin to work on the back?"
 And I just felt, "Oh, there's a real message of hope
 and full restoration in this dream.
 And I would begin asking the Holy Spirit,
 what's happening is there's something
 that has been taken from me.
 'Cause if you notice the hairdresser took from you
 really without your choice.
 And those would be the sort of questions
 that I would be asking.
 Sorry that I wish I had you in here yourself, Molly.
  </li><li>That's awesome.
 Was there any other ones that you had
 that sort of stood out to you in terms of relating to a bunch of people or not necessarily.
 There was another, one of your listeners shared a dream about a house again and in this one,
 they were in a house by the sea and they basically saw a huge wave coming in from the
 sea and it was as big as a house and looked like a wall of water.
 Now, you know, that's a symbol of something.
 And in the dream, they shut the doors
 and they ran upstairs and waited for the wave to hit,
 standing between the hall and the bedroom.
 And they hugged her and her husband hugged as they hit,
 as it hit, and the wave rattled the house,
 but no water came in.
 The house was so strong and sturdy that it stayed up.
 So again, I would be looking at that house in the dream
 as a representation of their life.
 and whether something had already happened or was about to happen where, you know, that
 wave, that water, that could be something that could destroy the house, that could shake
 the house immensely.
 But in the dream as they sort of hunker down, that wave doesn't even shake the house.
 I find it interesting that they're between the hall and the bedroom.
 You know, are they in a place of transition?
 know, I would wonder what's happening in your lives. And even in their relationship, are you
 in a place of transition? Is there a element of reconnection happening between her and her husband?
 Just always ask questions. Why is it? Why are we in a house and not in a hotel? Why am I on a bike
 and not in a car? One of your listeners sent in a dream about, you know, being going on a cruise
 ship. And again, you know, if you think about vehicles being sort of a symbol of our life
 journey, how does, you know, if you want to bite a little pedal bike and that's a lot
 of effort and you're there alone, you know, if you're in a car, again, there's a few
 people in there with you. If you want to ship, that's, I would think that speaking of something,
 you know, you're part of something that is much bigger, you know, is that speaking of
 a, you know, school, ministry, I don't know, something that you're involved with.
 I had heard somebody say that the vehicles often represent ministries or type of ministries.
 Yes.
 So from what you're saying, that's not like it doesn't seem like you can carte blanche,
 say vehicles always represent ministry, you know, fish always represent that you know what I mean?
 Like you, I love how you're still partnering with the Holy Spirit in the midst of it and saying,
 okay, well, what is that? What does that thing actually mean to you? Because if I have a dream
 about a fly fisherman or something, that's probably going to mean something very different
 than if somebody who's lived on a river and seen a fly fisherman their whole life.
 Yes.
 So, ah, symbolism is, when you look in the Bible there is so much symbolism.
 And for example, if you think about a lion, most of us, you know, would immediately say,
 oh, the lion of the tribe of Judah, that's representing Jesus.
 But the Bible also speaks about that lion that comes to steal, kill and destroy.
 is not representing Jesus, that's representing the devil. So it's still a lion, but it's a
 different, it's different elements of that symbol that are being used. And that is why
 we have to rely on the Holy Spirit. We have to ask him, be in relationship with him,
 ask him questions. He loves being asked questions.
 But I love that because it doesn't allow you to put God in a box. You have to stay in relationship
 and you have to go back and ask him questions. You can't just have a chart that says this
 always means this and this always means that. I know. Which I think is great. Give us one more
 dream, sir. Sometimes dreams can be very scary. Most of you have probably had bad dreams, nightmares,
 dreams that cause you to freak out and it's fascinating. The Bible talks about those sorts of dreams,
 dreams that wake you in the night that cause your bones to shake and many of us can either
 dismiss those dreams without realizing that there are a lot of causes for bad dreams, for scary dreams,
 whether it's trauma, whether it's grief, whether it's a processing of events in our lives,
 whether it's messages that we've not listened to and God is sending us warning dreams to try and
 catch our attention, to protect us from choices that are going to bring great destruction in our lives,
 or whether it's just the cry of our unhealed hearts,
 just waving a hand saying, hey, take notice of me.
 I'm in pain.
 I need your attention and your help.
 Caroline sent in a dream that you don't really
 say in the email, Caroline, as to how scary this dream was.
 But you mentioned that you're your aunt and uncle's house
 where your family vacations.
 It's nighttime, everything's very still,
 but you know there's lots of people around
 and they're all hiding from something.
 And you quickly try to find a place to hide as well
 because you don't want to encounter
 where everyone's hiding from.
 When you found a place to hide,
 you see a baby crawling across the yard
 and you quickly go into babysitter mode
 and get out of your hiding place to save the baby.
 Only to discover that the baby
 is what everyone else was hiding from.
 And as soon as you pick it up, it looks at you
 And in an adult voice says, "What are you doing?"
 The baby then proceeds to yell profanity at me.
 So I run away and then I wake up,
 man, that is an interesting dream.
 And, you know, I would begin to,
 you know, to ask you lots of questions.
 So Caroline, I would start to say, you know,
 you're at your aunt and uncle's lake house
 in East Tennessee where your family vacations,
 you know, what does that speak to you of?
 Is it a safe place?
 Is it a place with good memories?
 you know, do you have close relationship with your aunt and uncle? What's the context of
 that dream? And probably the next question, or maybe the first question I would ask, would
 be when did you have this dream? And maybe this is a point I should have thrown in earlier,
 but timing is really important with our dreams. You know, God speaks to us. Daniel said to
 King Nebuchadnezzar that God speaks to us about the thoughts of our heart. If you don't know
 what the thoughts of your heart are, it may take you a while to unravel your dreams.
 So the timing of this dream is important.
 So I would ask you what has, what have been the thoughts of your heart recently?
 What has been on your mind?
 What are the things going around inside?
 In the dream you're hiding, is there any way in your life right now that you're feeling
 like you need to hide, that you're feeling under pressure to do something that you don't
 really understand?
 The baby in the dream often babies speak of new things of innocent things and in this
 dream what feels a little freaky is that the baby is not acting as a baby would.
 That can be a little weird.
 There's so many horror movies where little children don't act like a brain.
 And half of you have probably watched one of those and then dreamed and had a nightmare
 about it.
 But you know it's important to know that what we see and what we take in affects our hearts
 and lives and our dreams will begin to represent that.
 You may be able to hide it from other people during the day,
 but what input you receive is affecting your heart
 and your spirit and your mind and your emotions.
 But in this dream, you pick up this baby
 and it has an adult voice.
 And so I would be asking, what is there a new thing
 in your life that feels like it's much more developed
 than it should be, is there something that has kind of intimidated a lot of people in
 the dream it feels like initially you have the confidence to go and maybe you have the
 innocence to kind of address it.
 And so I'd be asking, is there something that is scaring you, is that you've been hiding
 from, that you've been influenced by recently, that God maybe wanting to speak to you about?
 love about all of these things is that it's not, as Ajay alluded to earlier, it's not you look up
 a dictionary and work your way through the symbolism, but it's unique to the dreamer.
 And in the same way that God gives you the dream, you actually need God to interpret the dream.
 Yeah, it requires relationship.
 And what I love about your approach, Sarah, is that you apply the wisdom that God's given you
 in teasing out the answers from the Dreamers' heart. I love that. If people are listening to this
 and perhaps they've never considered that God's speaking to them in their dreams,
 what are some great resources that you could direct them to to help them start their journey
 and to understand dreams? The first one that I'd recommend would be a book by James Gohle called
 Dream Language. It is a great book for beginners. It's really accessible, it lays out a foundation
 that everyone can understand and then begins to lead you in some great sort of kind of starter
 tools of how you start unravel your dreams. Another book that I would really recommend is
 by Cindy McGill and it's called What Your Dreams Are Telling You and Cindy does a lot of dream
 interpretation as a Christian but in lots of secular environments and is a quite a refreshing
 take on dreams especially if you have a passion for interpreting dreams for people who are
 not yet Christians or want to do that as...
 In the marketplace, yes.
 Exactly.
 So she's got great language to use but...
 Awesome.
 Really recommend it.
 simple jacks and stuff, really good. Jane Hammond's book, Dreams and Visions. Excellent.
 One day I'll write book and then you can...
 Oh, we're always clambered.
 We recorded that.
 Yeah, what?
 Well, thank you, Sarah, for being with us. Not only teaching at the school this week,
 but also being on our podcast. As I said earlier, Sarah's one of our guest speakers
