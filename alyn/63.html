<p> Hello, hot stuff.<br/>
 Hello.<br/>
 Can you believe it's episode 63 of keeping up with the Joneses?
 I cannot believe.<br/>
 Are you feeling caught up with the Joneses?
 I feel caught up with something.<br/>
 It was an amazing week.<br/>
 It really was.<br/>
 And correct me from wrong, but we had no conflict.
 We had no conflict, which is pretty great.
 It is.<br/>
 So there you go, people to avoid conflict, get on a podcast and talk about your week of conflict
 and magically it fixes it.<br/>
 We got some great feedback from you guys this week.
 Thank you for everybody who wrote in and told us to enjoy it last week.
 We're more than happy to talk about.<br/>
 I mean, my wife is so that you guys can have a better week.
 That's unkind and untrue.<br/>
 Well, that's why it was funny.<br/>
 I just fell off my shoulder.<br/>
 Let's talk about your shoulder.<br/>
 Are we putting you down?<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Let's pick a day Thursday.<br/>
 Oh, what's so what's talk about?<br/>
 What's going on?<br/>
 I'm in an enormous amount of pain and we don't really know.
 what's going on. So I think the new plan is to go get an MRI. So at least we know what
 we're dealing with.<br/>
 You know, baby, cage fighting isn't as glamorous as you think it is.
 I know, I know, but I like the outfit.
 It pays well. You like the outfit, but it's taken its toll on your body.
 It really has.<br/>
 Do you want to know the highlight of my week?
 Yes.<br/>
 You already know the highlight of my weeks.
 Yes.<br/>
 Five shiny stars.<br/>
 Oh, I didn't know that was the highlight of my week.
 everybody why five shiny stars are so important.
 Well, because you spent a ridiculous amount of time, a ridiculous amount of time over a
 ridiculous amount of time.<br/>
 So since December of last year, yeah, 154 hours since December.
 I wish I had 154 hours to do something.
 You probably brought you probably brought us Pinterest for 154 hours.
 I am not.<br/>
 You're smoking dope.<br/>
 No, I'm going to install a little piece of software on your computer that tracks how long you spent on Zillow.
 I wish you would.<br/>
 You wish I would.<br/>
 I wish you would.<br/>
 You know what?<br/>
 It's being installed and in six months we'll report back.
 Except you do most of your browsing on your phone.
 So I don't know how I'm going to track that.
 Let's just agree that you spent 154 hours on Zillow.
 If there is not a chance.<br/>
 Anyway, we're missing the point.<br/>
 There's five shiny stars.<br/>
 Tell everybody why that's important.<br/>
 I have no idea why that's important.<br/>
 No, that's the wrong answer.<br/>
 Oh.<br/>
 Why is important? Because it's important to you. There we go.
 It's some game that you played and couldn't defeat and had to get a million people over to help you
 defeat it. And then you still didn't get your shiny stars. You only got your stars. Right. And
 then Abigail figured out why you didn't have shiny stars. Okay, watching my eight year old play
 Nintendo games is a tremendous source of joy for me as a parent because she's ingenious.
 It's ingenious.<br/>
 How is it ingenious different from genius?
 They're inside.<br/>
 Okay, she's a genius inside.<br/>
 Yeah, she's outside.<br/>
 She'd have to be a genius.<br/>
 Oh, we're on a roll, ladies and gentlemen.
 It was to say I finished a very complex game as fully as one can fully finish that game
 and again we tremendous sense of joy.<br/>
 I'm so glad.<br/>
 What else happened this week?<br/>
 No, no, I can't remember.<br/>
 Oh, we went to the movies.<br/>
 We did.<br/>
 What do we go see?<br/>
 We went to see Mission Impossible 4.<br/>
 Nope.<br/>
 Mission Impossible 5.<br/>
 Five.<br/>
 I can't believe everyone dies at the end.
 I was not expecting that.<br/>
 I know, it's shocking.<br/>
 I know, I didn't think that either.<br/>
 What did you think of the movie?<br/>
 I have to end it at some point though.
 I thought it was as good as the first one.
 Yeah, I thought it was very similar in field to the first one.
 They've departed a little from the formula and not in a bad way, just in a confusing
 way because for the first what felt like half of the film, I was like, this is really
 slow and then discovered that wasn't the first half of the film, that was maybe the
 first third, maybe even a quarter of the film.
 But thoroughly enjoyable.<br/>
 So good.<br/>
 Really, lots of twists, lots of turns.
 Yeah, I want to see it again just because I'm positive now knowing the end.
 I would be able to go back and see things.
 Very good.<br/>
 Maybe our kids went back to school.<br/>
 They did.<br/>
 It's hard to believe it's a new school year.
 I know.<br/>
 Why are you doing the whiny voice?<br/>
 Well, I don't know.<br/>
 I'm glad they're back in school, but it's just that they're growing and know
 that they're supposed to grow.<br/>
 But they're none of them really babies anymore.
 Well, they're supposed to grow. I'm glad they are. It'd be weird if they didn't.
 I know. Although having a bonsai baby would be pretty cool.
 A who? A bonsai baby.<br/>
 What's a bonsai baby?<br/>
 Like a bonsai tree, but a baby instead of a tree.
 And you just trim them?<br/>
 Okay, this tick. It's rest of the really dark and weird.
 Your mother who's been staying with us for three weeks, God bless her, it left today.
 Yes, she did.<br/>
 She's gone home for cataract surgery.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 But she's driving 14 hours.<br/>
 14 hours. So we're praying for all the drivers between here in Toronto.
 Yes. And she dropped, I mean, she's going to be 80 in February. And she drives the whole
 way by herself. But she's stopping in Ohio for like to sleep.
 Yep. Just in a lay by. But what's a lay by? A lay by is a British word for a rest stop.
 So okay, a rest up. Yeah, is that right? Sure. Yeah, she is not shit. We put her in a hotel. We did our main topic for this week is giving
 That's right. I try to think of a kind of a sexier title than giving
 Because giving in and of self doesn't sound very very sexy, but here's what I've come to realize upon reflection is
 I think one of the most practical and yet supernatural things I've ever seen in my life
 is how that God partners with our giving in incredible ways.
 And I think it's astonishing because you can enter into this supernatural upstream
 anytime you want just by giving.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 I reviewed our giving records tonight and I was totally motivated to give more.
 Good.<br/>
 All right, talk to me about giving.<br/>
 I love giving.<br/>
 I'm one of those people that when I first got saved,
 I didn't give, then I heard teaching about tithing,
 not giving, but the tie.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yep.
  </li><li>And was encouraged to test God, test me in this.
 And so I started doing that and I just saw things,
 I saw results.
 It did feel like 90% further than 100% and all that kind of stuff.
 So I really, I mean, I love tithing and then giving obviously is on top of that, which is
 just super fun to be able to bless other people.
 I mean, somebody randomly came up to me and blessed me today during church and just, you
 know, just gave me like a check to be able to go and get a massage, which was just so
 lovely, you know?
 I don't know who is Mark's sighted her me.
 Yes.
 See, you touch on something interesting about tithing.
 And I think some people think that they're giving when they're tithing, but that's actually
 a misconception.
 Right.
 I mean, you touched on that.
 Yeah.
 Tithing isn't giving.
 Yeah.
 Because you can't give someone what is already theirs.
 Right.
 It's returning.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 You return your tithe or you bring your tithe.
 You don't give your tithe.
 So giving is actually on top of that.
 we get too far into this is probably worth noting that there's a lot of nauseating teaching out
 there about giving. And I think that perhaps already maybe I'm guessing that if you're listening
 to this, you're like, okay, where are you going with this? Because we've heard so much mess in the
 church about giving and it's had a manipulative edge. And that's not where we're going. We just
 wanted to tell some fun stories about what we've seen God do through giving. Two thoughts up before
 we do that. The first is your right hand is not supposed to know what your left hand has given.
 So it's kind of weird that we're talking about giving publicly on a podcast, but the focus is on
 the action of giving not on who gave it, in which case us. Secondly, it's impossible to talk about
 giving to God without talking about the flip side of that coin, which is receiving from God.
 You can't give without being given to.
 And part of the point I'm talking about giving is the receiving point.
 But really, I am honestly trying to talk about giving for the sake of giving.
 Yes.
 Who do you think I learned giving from?
 Probably the same people I learned giving from.
 Joni Carroll.
 I was going to say sting.
 Sting.
 I got really close to him.
 You know, he was a math teacher before he was in the police.
 and I used to deliver papers to him.
 And one day he sat me down and said,
 "Hey, let me teach you this, King of the Principal."
 No, he didn't.
  </li><li>He was in the police.
  </li><li>Okay, we've got a lot to cover after the podcast.
  </li><li>I'm totally joking.
 Sorry.
  </li><li>Yes, it was John and Carol.
 (laughing)
 I watched them over the years give away money,
 cars, airplane tickets,
 time to people, laptops, phones.
 I mean, I was astonished at the generosity
 with which they lived their lives.
 They're amazing, yeah.
 Do you want to know the moment where it all clicked for me?
 When?
 OK.
 It's my first ever international trip with John and Carol.
 For those of you who don't know my story,
 I went to Toronto, did the school there.
 And after I graduated, I ended up
 interning with the senior pastors, the founding
 pastors of the church, John and Carol Arnott.
 And so this led to me a year of me traveling
 all over the world with them, never really leaving their site.
 And on the first trip, we went to Paris, France.
 And when he said, would you like to be our intern?
 I was anxious because being raised a good Scottish boy
 and probably being raised well with my parents.
 I'm thinking, how am I going to pay my weight?
 And John never once covered the whole issue
 of who would pay for what when we'd travel now.
 I'll cut to the end of the story.
 The end of the story is they paid for every single thing.
  </li><li>For a year.
  </li><li>Yeah, all my flights, all my accommodation, all my food.
 Everything, it was astonishing.
 on top of that would give me money to take you out and dates and would lend me their
 car. You know, it's just my mind was blown. But at this point, I didn't know any of this.
 And so we hadn't discussed what would be happening and I'm on a plane and that's fine because
 I'm figuring maybe they've got air miles, whatever. But we go, we land in Paris and
 it's the first night we've checked into our hotel and we go out for dinner and we're
 at a restaurant and I know I have no money because I'm an intern. Like I maybe have
 $20 to my name and I'm looking at this menu and I'm trying to in my head convert what the euro is into Canadian dollars and
 In my internal dialogue is I don't know what to eat. I'm thinking maybe I could just eat the French bread or it was just bread
 Because I was in France
 That's like Brazilian Brazil nuts are just nuts when you're in Brazil. I got you
 So I was thinking maybe I just eat and I was panicking out and I don't even know what to order like
 I don't know what to do and I remember just saying to the Lord, Lord, I don't know what to do and the Lord said
 I'm gonna teach you about some ship and so you know
 John was saying you know what what do you want to eat and I you know
 I'm doing a thing of like what are you ordering because I don't want to order well a I didn't want to order a steak
 I didn't want to order anything
 Lavish right and something what are they gonna order? You know maybe the chicken fingers the kids all of the kids chicken fingers
 No fries allocart
 And only two chicken strips, not three.
 It's just far too much.
 Well, can I get for 20 Canadian dollars?
 But honestly, I was freaking out because I had no money and I didn't want to be a burden to them.
 And of course, I had no revelation of the goodness and the kindness of God at this point.
 And I didn't really know John and Carol.
 I didn't know their hearts or the way they lived their life.
 And in that moment, when I was utterly unable to provide for myself, that they lavishly provided for me, you know, we just ate of these amazing
 French restaurants and yada yada yada yada. And they in that moment, I think, was the
 starting point of God showing me, I'm going to provide for you because you can't provide
 for yourself. And I watched them give generously to me and something happened in my heart where
 I think probably performance kicked in. I wanted to give back to them, you know, to
 kind of equal the scores. And that's a very British thing. You know, we have in our heads,
 We keep telling of who's paid for what meal so that we can repay and I hate to tell you
 that's not giving or generosity.
 Yeah, that really began my journey into sonship.
 I remember John preaching and he said, John 3 16, for God's love the world that he gave
 is only begotten son.
 And he said, Alan, the kingdom is ruled by a giver.
 Right.
 I've never even thought of that.
 And he said, Alan, when you learn to give, you learn to become more like your father.
 I think the problem with me is I tithed for years.
 I think I've pretty much tithed as long as I can remember.
 But this is what it went like in my head.
 Okay, God, I've given you 10%.
 Now back off, Trixie, like this 90% is mine.
 Don't you dare ask for any of it.
 And that's a poverty mindset.
 a stingy mindset where all your outlook is the best you can think of as mediocreness.
 I have given enough thank you. I would now like to steward the rest of my money. You
 can do that if you want. But then what happens is what you can do with your money is fixed
 on how much money you have. Whereas I would say that we live a lifestyle way beyond what
 our budget says we can afford. Yes. Great point of that was when we used to travel. When
 we used to travel internationally, we had no salary. We lived entirely by faith and off
 the honorariums we'd received from speaking and love offerings that people would give.
 we spent most of our life flying around the world, often in first class, which we obviously
 never paid for first class tickets. We could afford that. So we would buy economy tickets
 and we would just have such astonishing favor on that that we'd always, not always, but
 almost always be upgraded. And so if you were to look at the lifestyle we were living, it
 was something we could never have afforded. And I think that's an amazing principle that
 God teaches is that you give what you do have and you get what you could never have afforded.
 I forget where the passage is. I could have looked at, but it's the
 remember the Old Testament, the woman shows a lot of money and she goes to the Prophet and says,
 you know, they're coming to sell my take my boys away and sell them into slavery. What do I do?
 And he says, you know, go get charged from all your friends, relatives and neighbors
 and you know, fill them with oil. She's like, I don't have any oil. And he's like, well,
 just pour out what you have. And so she gave what she did have and it just multiplied. And she got
 what she had never afforded. Or the other one where is it Elijah or Elisha? I'll just forget which
 one it is. Goes to the widow, is it a zerafeth? Is it? Do I just make that? And there's a famine.
 And he says, bring me something to eat. And she's like, honestly, as a sure little Lord lives,
 this is all I've got. And he's like, I'll give it to me first.
 He's make the cake for you and your son, but give me some first.
 Right.
 The boldness of that profit.
 Because she's saying, "I'm just going to make this and die."
 Right.
 So she gives literally all she has.
 And she got what she can never imagine.
 So you're well within your rights to live off your 90%.
 And you can live that, but it will be capped by what you can afford.
 I've found, and we've found just from living a life of giving that is astonishing at what
 happens. It's astonishing the favor that...
 And it's so stinking fun.
 It is. It is tremendous fun to partner with Jehovah Sneaky and sneakily find people to
 bless. And I just love that part.
 We have a friend who shall remain nameless, who actually makes sure, like they're in terms
 of what they're paying for rent and whatever, they make sure that their rent is not above
 a certain amount because they want to make sure they have a certain amount of money on
 top of tithing to just be able to bless people every month.
 Amazing.
 So this person is like, "Well, I can afford X for rent, but if I do that, then I don't
 get to bless other people the way I want to every month.
 So I'm not going to do that."
 Here's a simple thing.
 If you would like to get in on this action, of course you can randomly and sporadically
 give. In fact, let me, let me say this, there's two ways you can give. One, you can give a
 God-directed way of giving. The Holy Spirit comes to you and says, "Hey, I'd like you to give this."
 And that's always a challenge and always fun. Or you can just give of your own volition, just
 decide to go meet in need and, you know, go bless somebody.
 For the person's groceries behind you, you can line or, you know, whatever.
 You know, and be, and, you know, I guess there's a couple of other ways you can give sacrificially,
 or you can give out of your abundance. Right? So, tons of different ways that you can give.
 One of the fun things that we started doing was tithing 11% instead of 10.
 It sounds ridiculous, but the two are astonishment. I remember the very first
 month we did that. We thought we're going to give away 11%, basically we're
 going to give away 1% and on top of our tithe of 10%. That month I remember we
 had been walking through Target looking at some of the stuff in the aisles that
 we would like, but didn't have in our budget.
 And so, you know, we needed some bar stools,
 we wanted some curtain rods,
 we really wanted to trampoline for the kids,
 and we really wanted a new sofa.
 And so we happened to be wandering and targeting,
 I remember that because we'd been looking at bar stools
 and just thought, well, you know,
 we'd been to TJ Maxx and looked at some other stuff.
 And that month, we, you know, tied the 11%.
 And our neighbors who we had never met,
 Well, hang on, how aren't we giving them groceries the day they moved in?
 We did. Yeah, that's right.
 When they moved in, we just showed up with like, here you go. Here's groceries.
 Right. So back up, neighbors that when they moved in, we bought them groceries
 and had other two never spoken to them since.
 Yeah. So like a year later, they're moving.
 And as they're moving, they shout across to us said, Hey, would you guys like a trampoline?
 And so we go around to the back and there is a giant, you know, a giant trampoline
 with a big fenced in circular trampoline.
  </li><li>They're netting, yeah.
  </li><li>And we're like, yes.
  </li><li>Fenced sounds dangerous.
  </li><li>Okay, so they gave us that trampoline,
 we just rolled over to our house,
 that was a nightmare to set up,
 but nevertheless, it was a huge trampoline.
 And we're like, that's amazing.
 So they're like, hey, we've also got some barstools
 that were not taking with us, would you like some barstools?
 So we went in and right enough, there were some barstools.
 And they're like, hey, we've got some curtain rods,
 and what else did they have?
  </li><li>Couches.
  </li><li>And they, yep, we got their couch,
 we paid $150 for their couch that's still the two couches in our house to this day.
 Yes, but I just remember thinking, God, we gave you 1% of extra of our ties and you
 astonished us by giving all that stuff.
 Yeah.
 Last year, and I'd like to do that again this year, but I wasn't as disciplined last year
 starting in January.
 And this is a fun exercise for everybody to do is I started a spreadsheet with what we
 gave and of course I didn't include our tithe. So just ignore your tithe as a given. Right?
 As a given, no pun intended. And I had one column dated what we gave and another column,
 what we received. And at the end of each month, I'd total up what we gave and then I would
 total up what we'd received. And I was just looking at it before I got on the podcast and I was like,
 Oh, I forgot about that. I forgot about that. Oh, my goodness. And sometimes what you receive
 isn't necessarily material goods. Sometimes it's, I mean, for example, last year, I think it was
 last January, had a fly over to see my mom. She'd just been diagnosed with cancer. And so I flew
 over in the last minute. Amazingly enough, somebody bought me flights to this day. Still
 still don't know who it was. We didn't know how we're going to get over. And somebody
 had anonymously said I want to buy flights. So it's bought flights, go to the air
 port. I have no status whatsoever with this airline. It was like the first international
 flight had flown with them. I'm standing at the gate waiting for my flight. And the
 gate agent is like, would Ellen Jones please approach the gate? And guess what? They'd
 upgraded me to first class, had a, you know, fully reclining, live flat. What do you call
 Yeah, like those pod things. Yeah, pod of a bed and I just, I was just like God, not only did you give me the flights, but they were actually upgraded like that.
 That was like a $6,000 ticket that I didn't even pay for.
 Right.
 Just astonishing things like that. And of course, when I land, what I find that they've, you know, hurts has upgraded me to this little sports car.
 I'm like, God, isn't it like an Audi or Mercedes or something? It was red.
 It was a bright red.
 Forget what it was, but it was a nifty little thing, but it's just astonishing.
 You're so funny.
 You're so not a car guy.
 It was red.
 It was a nifty little thing.
 You want to talk about hot potato?
 Well, yeah, we like to play hot potato.
 So sometimes when people give us cash, we just look around for somebody to give it to before it, you know, before it stays in your pocket.
 Right.
 Sometimes we won't even open up the envelope to know what's inside it.
 Sometimes somebody will come out and give us, you know, you know, randomly a gift or a gift card or an envelope or whatever.
 And before we left the service, we found somebody else to give it to.
 I remember being in Australia and we were teaching, I think, on giving.
 And as we were teaching, I saw this girl and just thought, Oh, I think she really wants to go to the school in Toronto.
 And I would love to be able to invest in that.
 Didn't have any cash because of it in Australia.
 But at the end of the service, somebody came up and gave me, I don't know, it was a couple of hundred
 hundred bucks or something. So I went up to the pastor and said, Hey, could you give this
 money that I'd just been given the hot potato to that girl over there, make it anonymous.
 I really think that she wants to go to the school in Toronto and let that be the first
 seed. Now sooner I'd given her that money when I was walking out the door, we were given
 a thousand dollars. And so I was just like, God, this is ridiculous. I remember our friend
 Chris playing that game where, you know, God would give him money and he would give the
 money away and the money just kept getting larger and larger and larger.
 Yeah, that was really cool.
 It was like every week, every week kept getting given money and then you give it
 away and you get given more and give it away and very cool.
 I mean, we've been given amazing things, haven't we?
 I mean, things you couldn't possibly.
 I was given a gorgeous diamond ring.
 You want to tell that story?
 That's a great story.
 That's a great story.
 Well, we were administering a church in England.
 And so you were teaching the Saturday morning session,
 and I was upstairs with Abigail just playing.
 I mean, she just turned one, I think,
 that day or the day before.
 And the pastor's wife came up,
 and she had something in her hand,
 and she just said, "You know, I wanna give you something
 "as a symbol of a return of your inheritance,
 "and as a promise for my girls and whatnot."
 And then she opened her hand and it's this gorgeous diamond ring that I wear every day.
 Um, but I looked at it and I was like, uh, you can't give me that.
 Like that is stunning.
 I mean, it's amazing.
 And she was like, no, God told me to give it to you.
 So I'm giving it to you.
 And I'm like, but you have three daughters.
 You, I mean, you can't give me that.
 And she goes, yeah, I can.
 My daughters know that if God tells you to give something away, you give it away.
 And I'm like, yeah, but you know, I knew two of her daughters and they were in the building.
 And anyway, I took it and I put it on, but I was so like, I mean, I tried to give it back to her
 like three or four times that week. Are you sure you still want me to have this ring?
 And I even checked with her daughters like, yeah, your mom gave me this. Is that okay?
 You know, kind of thing. And they were all like, no, it's awesome.
 I'm so glad you got that.
 I mean, the daughters, the whole families like that, they're just amazing.
 But it was such a blessing.
 I literally look at it every day and it just reminds me that God knows right where I'm
 at.
 It kind of looks like a target.
 God knows right where I am.
 But also, his extravagance towards us.
 We could never afford this ring.
 His extravagance is unbelievable.
 I love the very first weekend we came to Grace and I remember that.
 The church that we're now at Grace and I that we absolutely love that the first
 weekend we ever visited, they were doing weekend that they've done a couple of
 times since where they just take up an offering.
 They don't tell anybody what the offering is for, but they said we're going to
 give it away in full and they took up something like $200,000.
 $204,000.
 In one weekend and they didn't even know what they were going to do with it.
 They were just praying and saying, "Lord, where should this go?"
 And it just so happened that a few weeks earlier,
 there was a church that was absolutely devastated
 by a tornado. - For me.
  </li><li>And so they were like,
 "We're gonna give it to that church."
 And so the Sunday that we were there,
 they were driving over to this church
 and the church was meeting and saying,
 "The insurance is gonna cover it,
 but we've gotta come up with $200,000."
  </li><li>Yeah, the insurance was only covering a certain amount.
 So the remainder was the $200,000 and they, yeah, they were all meeting together.
 They're all in the meeting going, "Where are we going to get $200,000 from?"
 And in walks our church with a giant check for $200,000.
 Yeah, one of those giant plastic ones.
 And that was one of the things that made us want to move to.
 It was, yeah.
 Because in 2008, we played that game with the Lord where we said, "We want to give away
 more money than we've ever given away in our life."
 Yeah.
 And God is just so amazing at giving.
 at giving. One of the other things that's really fun to do is whenever you see a policeman
 by their dinner, or their coffee, or their whatever, just, like, I can feel the life
 out of them. It's awesome. I've got three principles for you. Yeah. Matthew chapter 7 verse 7,
 ask and it shall be given to you. Do what? Ask. Okay. And it shall be given to you.
 on our board will not our board in our school offices, Daniel and Sarah, who are just God's gift
 to administration. Yes, they are. They have a list of prayer requests, and then beside it,
 when God answered it, they're just amazing. So the list is huge of all the things that God's answered.
 I remember the first time, you know, everybody, when I was growing up, everybody had a car,
 but I didn't have a car. And I remember one day my parents let me their car, and I was like,
 "Hey, having a car is kind of handy."
 And so I just prayed, I said, "You know what?
 You have not 'cause you asked not."
 So I said, "God, I just ask for a prayer."
 And my-- - Ask for a prayer?
  </li><li>I asked for a car, a big one.
 And so my friends heard me say that,
 they're like, "Ellen, you have not
 "because you haven't bought yet."
 (laughing)
 But asking the Lord is a big deal.
 You can do it yourself if you'd like.
 And sometimes he will give you resources to buy things.
 but the house we're living in is because we asked the Lord for it.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think lots of times we cut God out of our finances
 'cause we think that that's something
 that we're supposed to be solely responsible for.
 So I mean, we do our 10% tie or whatever,
 but like if we need healing, we're cool to ask God for that.
 Or if we need a breakthrough in some other area,
 but for some reason, sometimes we respond to God,
 like it's not okay to ask Him for things
 that we need financially or whatever.
  </li><li>Or we don't ask and we lament that we don't have.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So the kingdom is run by a giver.
 So asking is a big deal.
 Then there's Luke 6, 38 says, "Give and it will be given
 "to you."
 I'm gonna read that in full, it says,
 "Give and it will be given to you.
 "A good measure, pressed down, shaken together
 "and running over will be poured into your lap.
 "For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."
 So my question is, what is it?
  </li><li>I know the answer, pick me, pick me.
  </li><li>The cute Canadian chick in the corner.
  </li><li>Whatever you give.
  </li><li>It is whatever you give.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so we've got story after story after story
 of giving iPhones, getting iPhones.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Of giving away stuff, giving away something
 and getting back the very thing that you gave,
 but bigger, better, brighter.
  </li><li>Better.
  </li><li>Giving time, getting time.
 You know, one of the things we really don't lack in life is direction, because we're constantly
 prophesying other people's direction.
 Like we're constantly prophesying vision and purpose and callings over people.
 And as a result, we're constantly receiving prophetic words about the same things.
 Yeah, it's true.
 Or even just sitting with people and, you know, helping them figure out their lives.
 Right.
 Same with encouragement. We're constantly encouraging people and so we're constantly receiving encouragement.
 Yeah.
 I got fun story about it.
 Okay, tell me about it.
 One time we were in a restaurant.
 And it's one of our favorite restaurants and we sat down and sitting right behind us was a very famous speaker who had is kind of largely responsible for why you're in ministry today.
 Yes.
 You'd heard them speak many, many, many, many years ago.
 And here they are in the same restaurant as you.
 So we just thought, wow, they don't even know we exist.
 They don't know your story, but wouldn't it be fun just to honor them for what they've
 done?
 And so we spoke to the server and just said, you know, when their bill comes, could you
 bring it to us?
 We'll make sure that it paid for, but don't tell them it was us.
 So we're in the restaurant and that's exactly what happens.
 We got to see their face because everything behind us, like I said, didn't have a clue
 who we were.
 So they had no idea.
 No idea.
 So they were walking away, just kind of blown away.
 So we finished eating our meal, we asked for our bill, and the server comes along and says,
 "Sir, ma'am, you're never going to believe what's just happened."
 We're like, "What?"
 They're like, "Somebody has just paid for your meal."
 And they said, "We have never seen anything like this in our restaurant."
 But that was a fast example of giving it will be given to you.
 We gave, and our lunch meal was considerably more expensive than their lunch meal.
 Yeah, we had eaten like ravaging wolves, and they had basically snacked.
 Like rabbits.
 Yes.
 All right, last principle, Galatians 6, 7,
 a man reaps what he says.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>It's an impartial law designed for our good.
 Whatever you put into that law, returns to you.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So you could sow negativity, you'll reap negativity,
 but that's not what that law was designed for.
 So if you sow honor, you're gonna reap honor.
 If you sow generously, you will reap generously.
 You know, I was talking about our church earlier.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And there's something over our church
 general's day. I really don't know of a place like it where I remember one Sunday, a couple
 had come to church. I'm not sure if it was their first time, it might have been their
 first time. And they came and somebody gave them a car. I mean, that's happened so many
 times in our church, people being given car. We had people being given houses. We've had
 people given like colossal debts forgiven. I mean, yeah, amazing.
 But I think part of it is you can create a culture where obviously Grace Narrow is a
 very generous church, some of the stories that we told, but there's something about
 that that when you are touched by generosity that you want to touch others with generosity
 too.
 Yeah.
 So here we go.
 This week, practice giving.
 Yeah.
 Something simple.
 Be in Starbucks or whatever your coffee shop is and pay for the person behind you.
 We love doing that at drive-through.
 We love doing that at toll bridges.
 when you're going over and you pay for the car behind, we just love messing with people.
  </li><li>So a random act of kindness. - Oh, everywhere. And then surprise people with kindness. It's
 astonishing what happens. I remember one time we were doing an offering at M&amp;A, I forget what it
 was for, and I said, "Left my wall in the car," so I ran out. And as I was running out, I discovered
 that I was very, very happy. And the Holy Spirit said, "Al and you're most like me when you're giving."
 Oh God, that's amazing.
 So cool.
 So the great thing about giving is you can step into the upstream of God's generosity
 just by partnering in the same way, just by giving.
 Yeah.
 And you give what you do have, you get what you could never have imagined.
 Yeah.
 All right, you're ready for an amazing listeners question.
 Yes.
 Okay, this is related to last week's topic about conflict.
 Okay.
 So anonymous writes in and said, "I grew up in a southern household where conflict was
 viewed as a fight. My mom handled it by blowing up followed by crying. My dad would leave the
 room or try to change the subject. All that to say, I wasn't really shown a healthy example
 of the potential, a necessity of confrontation or how to really work it out. I most identify
 with the absorbing part because of the belief system to keep the peace, especially in cases
 just me being too sensitive or judgmental or my wrong perspective. My struggle is, because
 I'm such a sensitive person, how to know when it's something worth confronting. A lot of
 things feel like big things and I can feel myself distance even when little things happen
 out of self protection. How do you know when it's your own issue that requires having more
 grace versus something to confront? That's the first part of the question. Let's answer
 that. I think the answer is to practice. The only way you know is to practice, is to just
 go to friends and just say, this could totally be my issue. I could totally be out to lunch.
 But would you hear my heart? Right. And then you share it sensitively with an I statement.
 Right. And once it's out of you, it's much easier to assess because when it's inside
 of you, it seems much, much bigger. And let's say worst case scenario, you were completely
 oversensitive and it really wasn't an issue. You'll pretty quickly realize that once it's
 out.
 Right. And then you start to build a schema for what's you and what somebody else or what's
 worth confronting.
 But the whole time you hide it, you're going to have to work overtime. And then any subsequent
 issues with that person are going to seem really, really large because we've already
 got an offense in the background. So risk it, learn really practical communication skills
 and try it and if it blows up, try it again. Because it's better than the way you're living
 life right now, I would imagine. Yeah, you're going to blow up anyway.
 Right. Eventually.
 Mm hmm. Second part of the question, when people confront me, it feels like rejection
 and a rebuke, even when it's gently done. I then want to fix it or condemn myself with
 how could I have and it takes days to recover from. This also makes me avoid being confronted
 at any cost as well as confronting because I don't want someone else to feel the way I
 feel when confronted. Thus the cycle. Do you have any advice for how to deal with that?
 We have this great phrase that we've borrowed from people who've taught us life languages.
 The first one is "professionalize don't personalize". So often when people are giving you feedback,
 is about something rather than about you. And so actually being able to professionalize
 and go, oh, actually, that's a reasonable request rather than thinking they hate me,
 they wish I was dead, they wish I was never born. That's not usually what's going through
 somebody's head. Otherwise, how are you ever going to grow as an adult? How are you ever
 going to grow as a professional? How are you ever going to grow in relationships if people
 can't give you valid feedback?
 Yeah, and you sound like somebody who has clearly has relationships with people and values having
 relationships with people. So you need to be able to hear when you have made a mistake because
 you value their hearts. And so there is part of it where you have to go,
 okay, I want to hear it because if I'm doing something that's painful to somebody else,
 I actually want to get it sorted out.
 And if you can view it that way instead of viewing it as rejection, then it's actually
 like training.
 The other thing that we have is, is what I'm feeling real or imagined.
 Right.
 And I think the fear of confronting or the fear of being confronted is way scarier than
 actually confronting or being confronted.
 I find in my life that my relationships have grown stronger with the people.
 I can honestly confront, or be confronted by,
 because I'm then given new information.
 Like I remember one of our staff members at Grace Center
 came to me one day and just said,
 do you realize that when you do this in pastors meeting,
 that I feel so incredibly hurt by that?
 And I'm like, no, of course I don't know that.
 I would never want to willingly do something
 that's causing you offense.
 And they're like, really?
 And I'm like, oh yes, like I'm horrified
 that causes your heart hurt.
 I can absolutely modify my behavior to preserve the connection that we have.
 And for them, they were so scared of coming to me in case I was going to be like, "Oh,
 I'll tuck it up, it's totally fine."
 But for me, this was new information added to our relationship.
 Poor person, for the past, I don't know, year has been thinking that I'm deliberately
 trashing their heart in meetings where I am completely unaware that what I'm doing is
 having this effect on their heart.
 relationship is so much stronger because they risked the current relationship they had and
 we got an upgraded one. What if all your relationships that you're currently managing in fear and
 hiddenness were exposed in the light and you got stronger and your heart was more fully known and
 you can understand their heart more fully known and you step into safety? Like the people I'm in
 rich real relationships with, I know they're going to come and bring something to the light if there's
 things I'm doing. I don't have to spend endless amounts of emotional energy worrying if they
 do or they don't like me or they, you know, I can just be myself knowing they're very
 good at saying, Hey, Ellen, this is how we're experiencing you.
 Yeah. I mean, all of our close friends are like that. They're people that can, we know
 that if they had anything against us or if we'd done something to hurt them, that they
 would come to us, which gives you freedom to be in a real relationship.
 Doesn't that sound like something you want?
