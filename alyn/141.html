<p> I'll live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Mrs. Jones.<br/>
 Yes, sir.<br/>
 You look glamorous.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 Resplendent.<br/>
 As do you.<br/>
 Oh, thank you.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Yeah, we have literally just walked in from a wedding.
 We have.<br/>
 Shelby and Jared, fantastic wedding.<br/>
 It was a great wedding.<br/>
 But we're dressed to the nines.<br/>
 Well, to the nines might be extreme.<br/>
 you're certainly much more dressed up than I am.
 You know, when you say to the extreme,
 I think the next thing you're going to say is
 to the stream of rock a mic, like a vandal and light up a stage
 and something rather candle, Iliac, it's like a rap sack, backpack.
 There's no rap sack or backpack in vanilla ice, a seminal classic.
 Well, I just know a different version.
 But I know the Canadian version.<br/>
 Nevertheless, when you say to the extreme, that is the next line.
 See.<br/>
 I think of.<br/>
 Did you have fun at the wedding?<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 It was a beautiful wedding.<br/>
 Food was fantastic.<br/>
 People were awesome.<br/>
 I wanted to stay and dance, but alas.
</p><ul>
  <li>You're here recording a podcast instead.
  </li><li>We had to record a podcast, yeah.
  </li><li>They had a taco bar.
  </li><li>They did.
  </li><li>I wish we had a taco bar.
  </li><li>It's brilliant.
  </li><li>I didn't know about tacos back then.
  </li><li>You never had a taco when we got married.
 12 years ago, never had a taco.
  </li><li>I don't think so.
  </li><li>Are you serious?
  </li><li>Did we ever eat Mexican food in Canada?
  </li><li>Well, we went to the Lone Star all the time.
  </li><li>Well, that was Tex-Mex and we would have fajitas.
  </li><li>Right.
 I wouldn't even say I hadn't branched into the realms
 of Mexican food.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>But yeah, tacos.
  </li><li>It didn't occur to us, but we wish it had.
  </li><li>Good choice, tacos for the win.
  </li><li>Although, having said that, I did like our wedding food.
  </li><li>I don't remember it.
  </li><li>Of course you don't.
  </li><li>Well, I was thinking about other things.
 (laughing)
 Talk to me about this week.
  </li><li>Well, at the school, we had David Campbell
 and Lyle Phillips.
 So David Campbell was on year two
 and Lyle Phillips was teaching year one.
 It didn't matter which year you were in, there was a Holy Spirit bonanza.
 It's true. It's totally true.
 The Holy Spirit was everywhere.
 It was amazing. And then of course at M&amp;A on Monday night,
 it was crazy town. People were stuck to the floor by the Holy Spirit until like 1130 at night.
 And the thing I loved about David is as a Pentecostal,
 he has a really well thought out theology in the Holy Spirit.
 Yeah.
 And I thought his message, I would recommend to anybody who doesn't know anything about the Holy Spirit.
 Yeah, of course.
 Like if I'd, you know, growing up in the Brethren Church
 that I grew up in, where we didn't major
 on the work of the Holy Spirit,
 that's not fair characterization for their revelation.
 But from what I know now,
 I would say that we didn't major
 on the work of the Holy Spirit.
 If I could have heard his message
 that he preached Monday night 20 years ago,
 it would have fast tracked me.
 He was so good explaining about how you received
 the Holy Spirit, how you, you know,
 part over the Holy Spirit.
 I'll put a link in the show.
 And so if you didn't get to see it,
 or you'd like to learn more about the Holy Spirit,
 I highly recommend David's message, Ammonate.
  </li><li>So cool.
  </li><li>But anyway, you're right,
 it was amazing having both of them there.
 Thank you guys.
  </li><li>What else happened?
 You took the girls on a father daughter dance.
  </li><li>A daddy daughter dance.
  </li><li>Daddy daughter.
  </li><li>Their school, I guess the PTA did something called
 Boots and Bling.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Which is where the little girls could dress up
 in anything from cowgirl boots to full on bling
 and their daddies were to take them to a dance.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>How excited were our girls on a scale of one to a hundred?
 400.
  </li><li>They were just.
  </li><li>I took Tia out on Wednesday to go and get a special dress.
 And of course she picked like,
 turquoise is one of her favorite colors,
 but she picked like the dressiest, most princessy
 kind of dress ever.
 And then Abby, of course, is kind of coming
 into her own style.
 She's a little bit older.
 So she wore a dress that a friend had given her
 with cowboy boots.
 'Cause to her, the most important part was the boots
 to Tia, the most important part was the princess look.
  </li><li>And the thing about Tia was,
 she was worried she didn't have shoes
 'cause she was like, "Mommy, I only have flip flops,
 "which I cannot wear to her dance."
  </li><li>That's right. - Or sneakers.
 Neither of which is appropriate.
 Can I get a pair of ballet flats?
  </li><li>Yeah, so we went and got some ballet flats,
 which were super cute,
 but she had to wear like white, almost gym socks with them
 because they were so big.
 Anyway. - Yeah, but she looked amazing.
  </li><li>She looked so cute.
  </li><li>And Tia was like, "Daddy, do you have anything
 that would be really nice to wear, like something you might wear to a wedding.
 Like, do you have one of those things where you have a shirt and you have a tie and then
 your jacket matches your pants?
 She didn't know it was gold suit.
 And I said, I do.
 She's like, could you wear that pretty, please, pretty, please?
 And I said, I will.
 And they were giddy with excitement.
 Didn't she ask you to be all in black?
 She did.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And then Tia on the dance floor was amazing.
 She was like an octopus on crack.
 The limbs flailing everywhere.
 Oh, it was amazing.
 and I was rebuked. I didn't dance enough.
 Oh, by who?
 By both of them.
 Oh, OK.
 I was like, I don't want to show up the other dads.
 If I bust a move, it's all over.
 You know, your kindness is just, it's amazing.
 It's my meanness.
 Yeah.
 I don't know what's greater of my meekness, my kindness.
 Or your ability to pretend that you can dance.
 Or my fictitious imagination.
 Yep.
 Saturday, I think a highlight.
 We had blueberry French dust, which should only be a Christmas tradition.
 Explain why we had it on Saturday.
 Well, usually we don't have gluten.
 So I don't make it very often.
 That's not why I was referring to it.
 Oh.
 You're adorable.
 We had a bunch of our emanate leaders over, so we made like a brunch kind of thing.
 So I made a couple batches of the blueberry French toast, which seemed to go over well.
 It was amazing.
 And then we had bacon, which we hardly ever have bacon.
 Yes.
 And yogurt.
 Yes.
 And orange juice.
 Yes.
 And breakfast potatoes.
 Yes.
 I was one happy bunny.
 Yes.
 It was it was a full breakfast.
 I forgot to mention that.
 While I was at the girls dancing the night away, you took MJ somewhere special.
 Yeah, I did.
 I took him on a mummy Sunday.
 And my friend Lauren, she brought her son Isaiah, who's one of MJ's little besties.
 And we went to this jumping place.
 Now, isn't just a jumping place?
 No, it has like a whole ninja area.
 So there was like ropes you could swing off into foam pits and just all kinds of craziness.
 Describe the phenomenon.
 That is American Ninja Warrior.
 Well, when I say that, I have to say it to the presenters.
 American Ninja Warriors.
  </li><li>We love the American Ninja Warriors.
 It's a TV show of basically,
 I mean, it seems like most people that do it
 are rock climbers and things like that,
 like incredible upper body strength or gymnasts or whatever.
 But it's an obstacle course with sort of extreme obstacles.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's an endurance test.
  </li><li>Yeah, but they're-
  </li><li>Exceptional physical.
  </li><li>On the show, they haven't actually done these obstacles
 before, they change them up every year,
 at least a little bit, and they don't get to try them out first,
 and it's just sort of a,
 it comes down to your agility and your speed
 and your ability to maneuver around new things
 and all that kind of stuff, and the kids love it.
 So they love the show, and then when my friend said,
 "Oh, there's like a Ninja Warrior area."
 I had said that to MJ.
 I was like, "MJ, there's a ninja warrior area."
 And he said, "Okay, well, is there water?"
 And I thought he meant like drinking water.
 And I was like, "Oh yeah, baby, I'm sure there's water."
 And he's like, "I don't wanna go.
 I don't wanna go if there's water."
 And he was just freaking out 'cause on the TV show,
 of course, if you drop off of the obstacle,
 you drop into a tank of water.
 So he was thinking I was gonna allow him to drink.
  </li><li>When he got there, was he super excited?
  </li><li>Oh, he was so excited.
 And him and Isaiah just sort of ran around holding hands.
 And Isaiah, I mean, Isaiah is a beast.
 He was just like jumping off of things and doing flips
 and just totally fearless.
 And MJ was happy to watch him in his fearless moments,
 but then he had a lot of fun in the trampolines and stuff.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was really cute.
  </li><li>I thought it'd be young and agile enough to do flips.
  </li><li>Right.
 Very cute.
  </li><li>And then our friend David Wagner is in town.
  </li><li>He is.
 Yeah, he spoke to us.
  </li><li>He spoke two amazing messages at
 amazing messages at Korea this morning.
 Really good.
 Big side to hanging out with him.
 Yeah.
 Talk to us about the topic for this week, babe.
 The topic for this week is hindsight.
 I was thinking about when we were thinking about what to talk about.
 I thought, you know, there's so many things in life where, you know,
 in the moment, whatever the situation is, feels, you know,
 hard or unfair or like God isn't listening or whatever the case may be.
 And then when you look back in hindsight,
 you realize it was due to God's amazing planning
 and his amazing fathering,
 that the thing that we thought we desperately wanted
 wasn't the thing that we got.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And it's never when you're in the season
 that you think, you know,
 the reason I'm not getting this
 is because of God's wonderful planning.
 You're just like, "Hey, what's going on?
 "This doesn't feel fair or whatever."
 But I was thinking there's a number of times
 that I could think of where in looking back,
 it was due to God's kindness
 that something didn't happen the way
 we thought it should have happened.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And not due to God not knowing where we are
 or what's going on.
 So my thought was to talk about hindsight.
  </li><li>Yeah, when David Campbell was here this week,
 he said this, "Both faith and fear believe in something
 that has not happened yet."
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And if we're called to walk by faith,
 that means we actually believe what's coming
 and live according to our promise.
 If we don't live according to faith,
 which is the temptation, you know, with our reality,
 it means we believe the wrong weather report.
  </li><li>Right.
 What was the thing you said also about,
 you know, the fruit of the faithfulness of God
 is always gonna be greater than the pain of the process.
  </li><li>Yeah, that was David Wagner, different David.
  </li><li>Ah!
  </li><li>So David this morning said that the fruit
 of God's faithfulness will outweigh the pain
 of our process.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 We often joke when we teach on the prophetic, that very rarely do we understand our prophetic
 words the day we get them.
 They're best understood in hindsight.
 When you stop and you look back and you're like, "Oh my gosh, Lord, you're so creative."
 The way you've weaved that prophetic word into our life and how it's come to pass.
 We so often think it's about the specific area that happens to be highlighted on our
 heart at that moment when usually it's much bigger than that, much broader than that,
 better actually than probably what we think it's for.
 I was thinking about when I was in, when I did my postgraduate and teaching, I had a
 professor, his name was Dr. Tom Conlon, and he said this, he said, "experience plus reflection
 equals learning."
 So if all we ever do is just experience, but never pause to reflect, we actually miss out
 on one of the most effective tools God's given us for growth.
 Just learning.
 God gives us hindsight so that we can be confident in what's coming. There's a danger that we won't
 learn how God works if we don't prioritize rest and reflection. Yeah, and thankfulness, I think.
 Right. We use hindsight to understand what God was up to for so we're strengthened for the next
 season. So I always think about the reason God gives you testimonies is to threaten the next
 giant in your life. So you think about David, the reason he had such confidence up against
 Goliath was he reviewed God in hindsight, rescuing him from the line and the bear.
 Right. You know, that victory gave him confidence that the next victory was around the corner.
 Right. And I think it was Bill who was saying, we've got to be able to practice worshiping the
 Lord in our lack. Otherwise, we're going to look foolish in his abundance.
 How many times have you like, God, you've forgotten about me? And then he shows up and
 and you're like, "Oh, just kidding, Lord.
 "Can I take that back?"
 We've actually got to practice the posture of thankfulness
 before we receive what he's doing.
 It's easy to praise God once it all makes sense.
 But it's when we don't understand what he's doing
 is when our worship is the most expensive.
  </li><li>Yeah, and therefore the sweetest.
  </li><li>Right, so give me some examples of hindsight
 and how it's helped in your life.
  </li><li>Well, one of the ones I thought of,
 and I think we've told this story before,
 but I remember this season in our lives,
 We just had Abigail and we were praying for more space.
 So we were sort of like, okay, we love living with John and Carol and we love the basement.
 But you know, Abby was, I don't know, six or nine months old and we were sort of like,
 I think we probably need some more space.
 I think we probably just need to have a playroom type area for her or something.
 And so we were in that process, the Lord said to us, hey, why don't you start looking at
 houses?
 And so we started looking at houses around Toronto.
 And of course, Toronto is a very expensive city to own a house in.
 And so we were looking and dreaming and we felt like the Lord, you know, just was challenging,
 really challenging us to dream with him.
 And so we were like, wow, that's amazing.
 God is challenging us to dream with Him right now in this season, which means therefore
 in this season we're going to have a breakthrough according to what we believe.
 And so we were in the midst of that.
 We were sharing with Gary and Sarah who are friends of ours and they were talking about
 how, oh yeah, they were really happy.
 They didn't have a house and they lived out of suitcases and it was great not to have
 anything to worry about taking care of and all this stuff.
 I was like, "Yeah, I totally get it," because they hadn't started having children yet.
 And so we were like, "Yeah, my head," I was like, "Yeah, that's not how I feel.
 I feel like there's a transition coming."
 And it's always hard when you feel like transition is coming because often you don't know the
 actual timing.
 So anyway, during this season, Gary calls us one day and says, "You're not going to believe
 what happened."
 And we're like, "What?"
 And he's like, these guys gave us a house.
 These businessmen gave us a house and we're like, what?
 And he's like, yeah, I mean, we didn't even want a house.
 And here's this house and it's on a golf course
 and it's got three garages and four bedrooms
 and this, that and the other.
 And I remember just being like,
 "I need to go and get my heart straight
 "before I can be excited for you
 "because I'm actually a little upset."
 'Cause I think I really thought God had crocodile arms.
 He'd broken through for them that meant he couldn't break through for me.
 Right.
 Like he used his last miracle on their house.
 Right.
 That somehow their blessing came at the expense of your blessing.
 Right.
 And so I remember sort of just being like, it was a sort of a brief conversation.
 And then we hung up and I was like, babe, my heart's so sore.
 I don't know what's going on.
 I'm really upset about this.
 You did much better than I did.
 And it's just prayed a bit and whatever.
 And then finally could get excited, you know, and then we called them back.
 It was like, that's great and you know, whatever.
 And what's funny is, you know, in hindsight,
 if the Lord had given us a house during that season,
 it would have been much harder to move.
 We moved within a year.
 We moved like eight months later.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And to a different country, you know?
 So it was right that transition was coming.
 What we were feeling was coming
 and that God was challenging our hearts
 that we were gonna have a house, you know,
 they was talking to us about all that stuff.
 But because we didn't have the timing,
 We thought we were getting short changed.
 Right.
 You know, I again, I think it was Bill Johnson who said this, that the best way to prepare for your own miracle is to celebrate in somebody else's.
 Right.
 Which is awesome.
 But it does drive up that whole thing of the fallacy that somehow other people's blessings come at the expense of ours.
 Right.
 Right.
 And it is so important that we understand, oh, wait, you know, their breakthroughs, our breakthrough, like what they're.
 What you're seeing right now is what's possible.
 Right.
 My God is still in the business of giving people houses.
 Yeah.
 You know, that can be your heart response or can be like,
 "Come on, God, why them and not me?
 I prayed longer. I wanted it more or whatever."
 Right.
 But when that happens, it usually indicates
 I dull train our heart.
 Right.
 That the very thing God would love to do
 would actually be an idol to us.
 So he's just using delay.
 Yeah.
 I'm sure it indicated a whole bunch of things in my heart.
 The other funny thing in that season was,
 you know, God was saying, "I want you to go dream
 about looking at houses. And of course, me being ever so pragmatic, I was like, this seems like a
 waste of time because after church, on a Sunday, we'd just drive around all these new developments
 in Toronto and look at houses. And you know, one day the Lord came to me and said, Hey, I have a
 question for you. And I was like, Oh, what's your question, Lord? He's like, Well, I asked you to
 dream and it's like, uh huh. He's like, so why are you just looking at houses in this price range?
 And I'm like, Well, that's what's reasonable. That's what we could afford. And the Lord was like,
 like you can't afford any of it.
  </li><li>Right, exactly.
  </li><li>Why do you narrow it down to a manageable?
 Is that what your dreams look like?
 Aren't dreams supposed to be--
  </li><li>Bigger than manageable.
  </li><li>Bigger than what's potential?
 And I was like, oh Lord, already you're doing
 a number on my heart.
 This is years before any of that would ever manifest.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But yeah, I'm so, it's amazing.
 You gotta look back.
 I was thinking about when I had finished my school year
 in Toronto.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And to my other shock, John and Carol on it
 are pastors in Toronto.
 I had asked them if I could intern with them
 and they were like, sure you can.
 And so I was getting ready to spend a whole year
 traveling around the world with two of my heroes
 and my little brain couldn't comprehend what was happening
 and at that time at the end of the school,
 everybody was asking everybody, what are you doing next?
 Have they asked you to be a small group leader?
 Are you going home?
 Have you got a job?
 Are you gonna volunteer at the church?
 And I didn't wanna tell anybody what had happened.
 Mostly because A, I was fearful.
 Like I spoke to John on the Sunday, I was somehow thinking that by Monday he would realize
 what a colossal mistake he'd made and cancel it.
 And so if I told people this is what was going to be happening, then I'd look stupid.
 And oh, I should have known that there was some mistake.
 Or B, I was worried that people would think that somehow I'd manipulated my way into it.
 And I'd worm to my way into this.
 Or C, I was worried that people would think, well, why you?
 Like, why Northwood, you get, you know, and basic fear of man all over the place.
 I didn't tell anybody and in hindsight,
 I realized I completely missed the heart
 of the prophetic community.
 We had A, pretty much everybody knew
 because they're super prophetic
 and B, when people did find out,
 they were thrilled for me.
 They were super encouraging.
  </li><li>So you missed being able to celebrate a milestone
 because of fear?
  </li><li>Totally missed that.
 And I actually judged all my friends
 as being judgmental how ironic is that?
 So I actually kept something that was huge to me
 from the community of people that loved me.
 And so I've, I, you know, with hindsight, I've realized, oh, actually, Lord, I, I missed an opportunity to grow.
 That's a good one.
 Speaking about growing.
 Yeah.
 I was out in, in Bethel.
 I was at one of the leaders in pants a couple of years ago.
 And I forget who it was.
 One, one of the leaders said, you know, we found that we've had to kiss a lot of frogs to find some princes.
 And they're talking about how, you know, when you raise up leaders, you're never quite sure what's going to happen when people get what we call the ring of power.
 And I was thinking about how in hindsight we've learned a ton about our own leadership
 style and the leadership style of others that we've raised up.
 Yeah.
 And how important hindsight is in that process.
 And I was thinking if we haven't, I'd say this to leaders, if you haven't grown in your
 leadership capabilities in the last two years, you're not reflecting enough.
 You can't think that you've arrived as a leader.
 I'd seriously hope I'm a better leader today than I was two years ago.
 Right.
 And I certainly hope more that I'll be a better leader in two years time than I am right now.
 Oh yeah, yeah.
 And that only comes by getting reflection and feedback.
 Yeah.
 So think about the things that we've learned about Hindsight.
 I think one of the biggest mistakes we made was we confused the skill set of requires
 to be a son and a daughter for the skill set requires to be a mother or a father.
 What do you mean?
 Well, so when we moved here, I'd only ever been a son.
 Right.
 I just thought, oh, it's the same skill set that's required.
 Right, right.
 Yeah, you're right.
 It's not.
 Fathers and mothers are hugely intentional.
 Yeah.
 I had to learn to be intentional.
 Yeah.
 You know, I just thought everybody would be like me, hey, if you need help, you just
 call.
 And I realized, no, actually people need nurture.
 People need checked in on people need connection.
 Yeah.
 And I, because I wasn't wired like that and because I'd go and get it, if I needed it,
 like if I needed anything from John and Carol, I wouldn't wait for them to come and ask
 me about it, I would go to them and say, "Hey, I have a question about this."
 Or, "What would you say?"
 They create such an environment where I felt very free to go and speak to them.
 Right.
 And then when we moved here, I just thought all our leaders would do the same, they would
 just approach us.
 Right.
 But if they'd never been fathered, how would they know to do that?
 Right.
 So I would just think, "Oh, everything's going great."
 And not realizing, "Oh, people are starving for training and teaching and connection and
 love."
 And like, "Oh, I actually have to be intentional with those things."
 So I'd like to apologize to everybody that I learned to pastor and practice being leader
 on.
 Please forgive us.
 Yes.
 There's some hindsight for you.
 That's a good one.
 I was thinking in terms of seasons and not knowing what God is doing.
 The other story I thought of was before we got pregnant with Abigail, we would book like
 a year and a half in advance to go and travel to.
 Right.
 sex sake, what we did for a living was we traveled the world literally and spoke at
 conferences and churches and schools.
 Right.
 And so that would all be invitation.
 People would phone us up and we would typically book, like you said, six months to a year
 in advance where people would say, "Hey, would you come to Australia and do this conference,
 or would you come to the UK and do this prophetic seminar?"
 Right.
 But during this particular season, we were booking even further out than that.
 And I remember in the summer, in the one summer, we were trying to book for the following
 summer and nothing was happening.
 Like, we weren't getting any invitations for that season of time and then, you know, we'd
 get some churches that would say, "Oh, we want to have you, you know, sometime next
 year."
 And we'd go, "Oh, great."
 And we'd try and plug them in somewhere in this gap where we didn't have any bookings
 and we just could not make anything stick.
 It was like, you know, we would throw something up against that calendar and just peel right
 off.
 And I remember thinking like, babe, we're not going to eat like, right, because we had
 the trouble here with this large five month gap, right?
 We had invitations coming before and invitations coming after, right, but nothing for five
 months in the middle.
 And it was, it was like packed before and after.
 And when we try and offer anything in that five month gap, it just would never work.
 And then we found out like months later that we were pregnant and actually that five month
 gap was the first five months of Abby's life.
 And you know, she was pre-me and there was lots of adjusting to do and you know, to get
 on a schedule to get everything figured out so that we could travel with a baby, all that
 kind of stuff.
 So it was really funny because God actually took care of all of it.
 He took care of all the finances.
 And in fact, during that time cleared all of our debt, which we were in an enormous amount of debt.
 Right. Who would have thought that we stopped working?
 We stopped working. I mean, we tried to. And at the end of that season, our debt was paid.
 Yeah. That sounds like God. But at the time, we were panicked about that five months. And we were
 just like, gosh, God, what is going on? I thought you said you were going to provide. I thought
 you said, "X, Y, and Z, I thought blah, blah, blah." And then in hindsight, you look back
 and you're like, "God's so perfectly planned everything that we had a five-month gap to
 rest and recover and recuperate and figure out having a baby and just enjoy her and both
 of us be home and all that kind of stuff." In hindsight, we're like, "Oh, it's the kindness
 of God." But when you're heading into that season and not being able to see that, it
 seems kind of scary.
 The trick of course is hindsight tends to work itself out if we allow it to.
 Yeah.
 If you don't quit, seriously, if you don't quit in the process, eventually it all becomes clear.
 Yeah.
 Now, sometimes it doesn't become clear this side of eternity.
 But generally speaking, if you wait long enough, you see the hand of God at work in your life.
 Right.
 The trick is to bring that trust and that faith into the present day.
 Right.
 where hindsight isn't helping you right now and foresight seems like guesswork.
 So that's where you trust. You're just like, okay, God, I believe that you said something.
 I try to be obedient. I'm in the midst of it. I don't know how this all works out.
 Circumstances seem contrary to my words, but I'm trusting you.
 And you can trust because you've built up all these little testimonies of God breaking through.
 If you can go back and remind yourself of what he's done before that you didn't see,
 and he proved himself faithful.
 If you can go back and be thankful and focus on those things,
 then you can actually build up or strengthen your trust
 and your faith to be able to head into the next season
 and know he's still the same God that he was last year.
  </li><li>Right.
 And the way to do that is, like you said,
 strengthen yourself and the Lord,
 recall to mind the things he's done for you.
 But also be in a community where people are sharing
 their present day victories.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Because it actually gives you hope.
 It gives you confidence.
 Okay, God is still in the throne.
 Of course, God's still in the throne.
 But like I said, we tend to believe whatever weather
 report system is speaking loudest to us.
 Right.
 That's why stillness is so important.
 Like father, what are you saying?
 Not what is my bank balance saying, not what are my friends
 saying, not what is the new saying?
 Or those doctors saying, you know, it's so important to have peace
 in the word of the Lord.
 Yeah.
 What about parenting?
 What about parenting?
 Well, think about what you've learned with a third child
 as opposed to what you knew with your first child.
 Like for example, when you have your first child,
 you don't know if anything you're doing is right
 or if it's working.
  </li><li>Right, yeah.
  </li><li>You have nothing to compare it with.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And you think everybody else is judging
 your parenting ability.
 Most people don't care about your parenting ability.
 It's a, I promise you.
  </li><li>Or when you're in a restaurant,
 you think that everybody else can hear your kid.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And that your, your child is single-handedly ruining
 the dinner of everyone in the entire restaurant.
 By the time you have your second or your third kid,
 you've got some hindsight.
 You're just like, oh, the first one survived.
 Doesn't matter if this next one needs dog food.
 It's fine.
 It all works itself out.
  </li><li>I don't remember arriving at the dog food phase,
 but anyway.
  </li><li>You never left them alone with me.
  </li><li>Oh dear.
  </li><li>Just kidding.
 So there you go, folks.
 I don't know where you are right now.
 I don't know what's going on in your life,
 but I want to encourage you,
 take some time out this week
 to just have a coffee time with a lord.
 If you don't like coffee, substitute it for something nicer.
 and just sit and write out some of the experiences
 you've been through with God
 where you have the benefit of hindsight,
 where you get to look back on what you did
 and you see the majesty of God weaving together
 an amazing story and consider that where you are right now,
 your chapter has not been written.
 It's still being written and how this chapter ends
 is largely dependent on our attitude right now.
 So choosing to trust God, choosing to commit to obedience
 is super vital for not only getting through the season
 but possibly shortening the length of time that you're there.
 What does the Joyce Meyer said?
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>The length of time you spend in the desert
 is largely dependent on your attitude while there.
  </li><li>Right, which is like, oh.
 Okay, babe, I have a listeners question for you.
  </li><li>Pimmy.
  </li><li>It says, "You mentioned that you had an app
 to block spam calls.
 I would love for you to just give a list of all, yes, all,
 the apps that make your life easier.
 I don't know what I don't know.
 My future self thinks you as well.
  </li><li>Perfect.
 Well, who should do a podcast all about the apps
 that we use that may or may not appeal to some people?
  </li><li>Yeah, I think some people would tune out right away,
 like myself maybe.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Are you kidding me?
 Hasn't your life been improved by the apps?
  </li><li>Yeah, I like your tan on my phone.
 It's really fun. - Okay, the set list
 of content tonight, for example.
 I'm outside at this wedding,
 which is a beautiful wedding.
 You were smart, you bought a winner jacket.
 I'm sitting there cold thinking,
 oh, I wouldn't give for a cup of tea right now.
  </li><li>So you use that app that turns your phone into a heater
 and you shoved it inside your suit jacket.
  </li><li>No, I use that app that schedules somebody else
 to go to Starbucks for me, picks up a cup of tea
 and dropped it off from me at the front,
 the front steps of the wedding.
  </li><li>So funny, I had so many people go,
 where'd Alan go?
 Has he laughed already?
 And I was like, no, he's waiting for like an Uber driver
 who's dropping off his Starbucks tea
 so that he can get warm again.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>So anyway, maybe one day we'll talk about all the apps,
 but the app that you're asking about in question
 is an app called No More Robo.
 And I will put a link to that in the show notes
 because it's hard to spell,
 but basically it means no more robotic calls.
 Is that what it's called?
 Robotic calls?
 That's all right.
 Robo dialers, you know, these computers
 that just dial numbers after numbers
 and after numbers and spam.
 So the app I use is called No More Robo.
 It costs about, I think, $3 a month,
 and it updates itself every half an hour
 with all new numbers.
 And since I've been using it,
 I've maybe had one spam call.
 No false positives, it's brilliant.
 I highly recommend it.
  </li><li>Can you put it on my phone?
  </li><li>Oh, wait, I'm so sorry.
 I thought you were the person that would be bored
 to tears if I talked about the apps that I just--
  </li><li>You're supposed to be doing my tech support.
 What do you think I pay you the big bucks for?
  </li><li>Well, you know what you should tune in
 in a couple of weeks when we talk about apps.
 See?
 You might learn something.
  </li><li>Yeah, whatever, I just put it on my phone.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>All right, baby, let's wrap this bad boy up.
 What do we need to say?
 Our applications for our school of supernatural life
 are open.
  </li><li>Yep, year one and year two.
  </li><li>If you'd like to spend eight months with us
 in gorgeous Franklin, Tennessee learning all about
 the wonderful presence of God,
 his nature as a loving father and being empowered to walk
 in the gifts of the Holy Spirit,
 we would love you to come and consider doing our school.
 If you've done year one, you're welcome to do year two.
 If you haven't done our school,
 You can learn more about it at graceinner.us/school.
  </li><li>The show notes for this evening,
 you can find at <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/141.
  </li><li>And then lastly,
 A.G.'s book, "Finding Father is Back in Stock"
 at our website.
 If you haven't read "Finding Father",
 it is a 12 week study guide designed
 to increase your intimacy with God.
 In the book, it teaches you how to soak,
 how to hear the voice of God,
 and more importantly,
 how to redefine your understanding of who God is
 and what he's like.
 I highly recommend it, not just saying that
 because I married to the author, but we've got so many five-star reviews from people all over the world who've loved that book.
 I'll put a link to it in the show notes.
 Thanks, babe.
 I also wanted to let you know that for those of you that I'm asking when the video course will be available, we don't actually know yet, probably in the next couple of months.
 But as soon as we do have it ready to go, we will be sure to let you know both on the podcast and through the website.
 And as we wrap up, we're constantly encouraged every week.
 We seem to meet people who are saying, "Hey, I listened to your broadcast," or "So
 and so suggest I listen to your podcast."
 And we found that word of mouth is the most effective way of people discovering our podcast.
 So if you can think of somebody that would greatly benefit from listening to this episode,
 they'd really encourage it and we'd sure encourage it if you'd recommend our podcast.
 If you could do that for us, it would make everybody's world a little bit brighter.
 Thanks for tuning in.
 We'll be back next week.
