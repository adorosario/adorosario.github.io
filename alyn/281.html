<p> I'll in an age is but got more Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode 281 of Keeping Up With Joneses.
 I'm joined today by my glorious resplendent, beautiful wife.
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong><br/>
 Agee Jones, how the heck are you?<br/>
 I'm good.<br/>
 I look like Heidi right now, don't I, with my hair all done in a fancy thing?
</p><ul>
  <li>I'm not gonna lie, it looks really cute.
  </li><li>Does it?
  </li><li>Mm-hmm, oh good.
  </li><li>Yeah, I was checking you out earlier today,
 going, "Oh, look at that."
  </li><li>Look at that.
  </li><li>Look at the little fancy, the one there.
  </li><li>I got like a fancy hair wrap thing
 that's supposed to curl my hair while I wear it.
  </li><li>Just remind people, when did you get it
 and who got it for you?
  </li><li>I got it for Mother's Day.
  </li><li>That's really, you're welcome.
  </li><li>And I did try it one night and I slept with it in
 and it worked great that day.
 like it, I mean, while I cut the curls for a couple of hours,
 which is about all my hair will do.
  </li><li>Yeah, it does not discourage you,
 but it does seem like a fool's errand.
 Like I know you love wearing it,
 but the curls maybe last 15 minutes.
  </li><li>No, no, no, no, it lasted a couple of hours the last time.
 So it did, you didn't see me, I went out.
 So I'm gonna wear it right up until like right before the wedding,
 and then I'm gonna take it down.
  </li><li>Yeah, well, we should probably talk about the wedding
 in our weekly update.
 Yeah, we're going to a wedding.
  </li><li>We're going to a wedding.
 We finally decided to tie the knot,
 having lived together.
  </li><li>And that's not funny.
  </li><li>No, we are not getting married
 'cause we already are married.
 That was a joke everybody, don't write in.
 Our good friend Kate is getting married to Miss David today.
 And we're all very excited about that.
  </li><li>So excited, so excited.
  </li><li>That's not really a weekly update
 'cause that's a future thing.
 We don't tend to talk about future events.
  </li><li>Well, it's a future in that it's guest today
 but later a couple of hours.
  </li><li>Give me a weekly update,
 'cause you had an interesting week.
  </li><li>I did, I went away by myself to the beach.
  </li><li>You did?
  </li><li>Yeah. - Sunny Florida.
  </li><li>Sunny Florida.
  </li><li>How was that?
  </li><li>It was wonderful, like, so wonderful.
 I just got like a little place where I could walk to the beach,
 walk into Rosemary, walk into Ellis Beach,
 and I basically just walked around.
 I didn't talk to anybody.
 I only spent words on ordering coffee or ordering tacos.
 And that's about it.
 I just, for three days, didn't talk to anybody
 and just had some great time with the alert
 of my favorite little church in Seaside
 and walked around and rested.
  </li><li>It was really interesting watching you unplug
 because the whole goal was that you were going away
 to just get some time on your own so much
 you need rest and recuperation.
  </li><li>Yes.
 And so you're very adamant, no, I'm having time to myself.
 But Sunday we should drive down.
 And I got lots of texts that don't really have much content, but they feel like they're
 just for connection.
 They worry.
 Well, like, babe, again, like I said, I've not spent time away from you.
 Yeah.
 It was just funny, though, that the contrast between the babe, joining to know, and they'll
 be all flying, and we talk to envy.
 in my head, I'm like, "You have a six hour drive ahead of yourself. There ain't no way
 you're noggin' text me." So you're like, "Hi, wish you were here to rub my neck. Hey,
 just stop in Starbucks. Hey, just give me an update. Hey, what's going on?"
 Well, I thought you would want connection. That's fine. I'll remember that next time.
 No, no, no, no. My point was that there wasn't one connection. My point was the contrast between
 your adiments that you were going to be offline. Yeah. And then the next day you left. You can't
 come back for the sugar right here. That's right. I will, I kept texting you that day. It did feel
 so weird to be by myself. And then by the time I got to Monday,
 Oh, I didn't hear from you. You didn't hear from me all day.
 Monday. In fact, you texted me Monday night and said,
 are you still alive?
 I just texted you because I was like, I'm not sure what the expectations are.
 Like, I think I heard that you don't want anything, but like, yeah.
 But anyway, you had a great time. I did. I totally unplugged.
 And I am like, wow, yeah, I am an introvert and I do need introvert time.
 So and you went from that experience to a house full of 14 people within about three days.
 Yeah.
 So on the Wednesday, all of our small group leaders and staff from the school of supernatural life
 joined me down in Florida, like half an hour from where I was.
 Yeah.
 And so then we did our end of year retreat.
 Um, so I went from no spending, no words, not having to talk to anyone to living in a house with 14
 people. I mean, thankfully people that I love, but like, yeah, you know, it was, it was a big,
 it was a big culture shock or a big shock for me to begin with. I was like, I don't know if I could
 do this, you know, but anyway. Well, thank you to the SSL staff who kind of rehabilitated you so
 that when you came home to a husband and three children who hadn't seen you in a week,
 your relational circuits were all online. And they were so sweet, they ran down the stairs and
 cuddled me when I arrived. Yeah, what about me? Well, you didn't run down the stairs and cuddled me when I arrived.
 That's because I was already downstairs. That's true. And I was a sweaty mess because I was trying to tell you the house for your arrival.
 And you did a great job. That's all I wanted to hear. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you, well, you enjoyed your time down in Florida.
 You had chaos. No, I didn't have chaos. Kids were great. I enjoyed my time because I had a Tesla. You did. But you also had a tick bite.
 Did it take about that was weird like what I didn't know what a tick was till I moved here
 Do they have ticks in Canada? I never heard of them until I moved here either, but they must have them right
 I mean, it's cold. I'd never heard of somebody having a tick I'd never heard nor did I know what a tick was and I'd hear
 About people and you know, we've been camping and we never encountered them blah blah blah blah blah
 But I think because we've done a lot of yard work
 I mean, I guess that's the only place I would have got it from but yeah
 I woke up, we did yard work on the weekend, didn't notice anything.
 Monday morning I woke up and I knew there was a problem when I couldn't get my left foot
 into my left shoe.
 And I was like, wait, what?
 And I looked down at my foot and my foot was completely swollen.
 And as the day went on, both of my legs were super swollen.
 I was like, what is going on?
 So obviously I hit up WebMD and then I checked my blood sugar and I checked my blood pressure
 and everything's fine.
 And I'm like, what is this?
 So I go to work and not really thinking about it.
 My feet are really, really tingling.
 I don't know if this is so odd.
 And at one point I reach back and I scratch my back
 and I feel what I think must be a skin tag.
 And so I just yank it off,
 which you shouldn't do to a skin tag.
 I didn't check web MDs for skin decks, I.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I've cut off skin tags with scissors
 and I'm pretty sure not to do that either.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Sorry.
  </li><li>Yeah, do not take medical advice from this podcast.
  </li><li>You don't wanna follow what we do.
 I pull off what I think is the skin tech and I realize it's a very much a life tick with a little yellow dot on the back.
 It was so moving still moving.
 And so I put it in a ziplock bag.
 Good job.
 Yes. Well, we learned that from your right.
 Yeah, because it's a website called tick check.com where you can send your tick off to see if it's carrying any diseases.
 But the next couple, I almost went to urgent care that day because my legs continue to swell up.
 Yeah. All night. And so again, I realized I just came home, hung upside down on our like inversion
 table to get my heart below my legs as I was supposed to do, and then slept with my legs propped up.
 And the reason I couldn't go to tick check, the reason I couldn't go to physician surgeon care
 is there was no one to watch the kids. And by the time I picked up Abi who could watch the kids,
 it was closed. Tuesday was much the same, but then also my hands
 swallow up and I'm like, what is going on? So at this point, I booked on a problem with my GP,
 went to see her on Wednesday and she was like, yeah, I'm going to start you on a broad spectrum
 antibiotic. Well, we figure out if that disease, if that tick is carrying any diseases.
 So don't know that yet. Feel fine today, except for in unrelated news, my back went out, which is
 why I'm not a church this morning. And instead, I'm recording a podcast with you before you go
 go out and do bridesmaidy stuff.
 -That's right.
 Except there are no actual official bridesmaids,
 but I get to do bridesmaidy stuff.
 -Right.
 -I don't know how we got on to talking about the tick
 when all I wanted to do was wax lyrical about the Tesla.
 -We'll go back to the Tesla.
 Tesla's in ticks.
 We could call this episode Tesla and ticks.
 -I'm convinced that short of the money side of things,
 I am Tesla's target audience.
 Like, I don't have $130,000.
  </li><li>Short of the fact that you can't afford one.
 Sure, the Target audience.
 Great, I think they want people
 that can pay for them actually.
 I think you're really not the Target audience.
  </li><li>I love it.
 Like I love it so much.
 It feels like the first time I used a Mac from a PC.
 Like a lot of people don't know I was a PC nerd
 before I was a Mac evangelist.
 But just everything about it is beautiful
 and well thought out and crafted with intention.
 And so you walk up to it and it opens the passenger's
 or another kind of driver's door for you.
 If the kids all get in through their doors,
 as soon as you get into the car
 and put your foot on the brake,
 it closes all the doors 'cause it knows you're ready to go.
 And then obviously I've been driving
 with it on autopilot the whole time.
  </li><li>I mean, obviously.
  </li><li>And I realize it's a much better driver than me.
  </li><li>I'm gonna just sit on a TV but that's all.
  </li><li>With one caveat.
  </li><li>Oh dear.
 Like I would say 90% of the time it does a great job.
 And then 10% of the time it's a combination between
 a drunk driver, a teenage driver, and an old person driver.
 We're just randomly, it will forget where it is
 or what it is doing.
 So maybe it's not much better.
  </li><li>Well, that sounds like you.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Maybe it's not much better driver than me.
 But I love it.
 And it's only getting smarter and only getting better
 like with the AI of driving.
 But I, it makes driving so much more of an enjoyable experience.
 That's because you're not driving.
 That's great.
 Yeah.
 I love it.
 I feel somewhat more confident having you driving the kids around in the Tesla than
 in anything else.
 Oh, absolutely.
 It was also the top rated, you know, five star for safety.
 So I fully agree with that.
 But I think part of my problem is when I'm driving, I lose focus and I'm uninterested
 and I get distracted really easily.
 is in the Tesla, it's doing much of the heavy lifting for you.
 Yeah.
 It just prompts you periodically to say, are you still awake?
 Are you still there?
 And it's amazing.
 Yeah.
 It's absolutely amazing.
 It parks itself.
 I want to clarify.
 I still want Sienna minivan.
 Or just-Hush 
 now.
 OK.
 You are horshing my vibe, woman.
 Oh, sorry.
 Sorry.
 We won't drive it, so-It 
 will park itself.
 The kids love it.
 There's tons of room.
 Yeah.
 It's just that $130,000 that is the problem.
  </li><li>It's the minor, 130,000 dollars.
  </li><li>Yeah, but anyway, I'm loving it, absolutely loving it.
 And why have it as a friend is out of town
 and said, do you want to have my Tesla while I'm out of town?
 And I'm like, yes, yes, I absolutely do.
 So I've been loving it.
  </li><li>So great.
  </li><li>Our main topic.
  </li><li>Well, hang on, I thought, I thought for a second,
 like I've had a couple of people ask me recently
 what's going on with the adoption stuff.
  </li><li>Yes, let's talk about that.
  </li><li>And so I thought it might be good for like, you know,
 just the regular listeners to do a little bit of an update.
 And it's kind of a non-update.
  </li><li>Well, it will explain
 why there hasn't been much of a conversation
 about the adoption.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So we are still waiting to be matched.
 We're still waiting to be batched.
 (laughs)
 We're still waiting to be matched with a mom.
 So we have seen several situations go through
 with two very large agencies.
 But again, often people are asking for homes
 where there's no other kids yet or homes that are non-religious or whatever the thing is.
 So it's sort of a niche market that's going to want their child adopted into a family
 where three other kids already exist.
 I don't remember how many pitching this to me.
 So maybe it was the story I came up with.
 Okay.
 But was, "Hey, you have to do all this work and that's the hard part."
 And then the, you know, as soon as you've done all that work, you'll just be inundated
 with the requests.
 That's how it felt when they were explaining it to us.
 And sure enough, we did lots of work, but it's over a year since we started all the paperwork.
 And I think my idea was, well, you know, because they said, yeah, you tend to get matched within, was it 18 months?
 Well, they said that, like, our main person, she said there are averages around seven months,
 but it's, she said it can be as much as 14 to 18 months. But she said, she said from the time that you go live,
 like all of your stuff goes live, which we didn't do that to the beginning of November.
 And I think that's important for me to remember, because otherwise I'm like, "What?"
 You know, I thought this was...
 Yeah.
 It would go way faster. So every day we...
 Check the website and see how things are going and then just praying.
 But one of the most common things I have is people ask me how the adoption is going
 and then they apologize for asking me. I'm like, "No, you are welcome to ask us."
 Yeah, we don't know.
 Anytime you want.
 You know, we tend to live very public lives,
 especially in this space.
 So we're happy for people to ask us about it.
 And we really love the interest.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So we're just waiting and hoping and it was God's idea.
 And so we have, you know, some confidence
 that it'll be in all the right timing.
  </li><li>And that's the bit that helps me when I'm, you know,
 'cause I like a plan and I like to know what I'm doing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Is when that doesn't happen.
 I just go, okay, good.
 Yeah, we're following you.
 You led us into this.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 like, wouldn't it be great if we got matched in the summer?
 Cause then we could be there and go with you for the birth and everything.
 I'm like, it would be great.
 It might not happen.
 Yeah.
 You know, um, so we're just sort of waiting.
 It is funny how we've kind of modified our life though.
 Like as soon as we went live with, we were adopting and you signed up with
 all these agencies, we kind of made all these plans tentative with adoption.
 Like I remember going away for your 50th going, okay, well, we're going to do
 this, but we might have to cancel last minute.
 And now I'm just like, we're just gonna live life as normal.
 Yeah.
 And I'm sure if it happens, it happens.
 Yeah, because I mean, in reflection, I think we didn't do a bunch of like our little family
 weekend away, things that we would normally have done that are super life to us.
 Because we were afraid, well, you know, what if we basically book this, pay the money for
 whatever and can't go?
 Right.
 Um, and of course, none of that hasn't happened.
 And we could have actually had those moments.
 So I think we have to just keep doing normal life and then,
 and keep praying and keep being open and keep waiting and,
 but probably not put everything on hold.
  </li><li>There you go.
 So that's our adoption update.
 Good to do a main topic?
  </li><li>Yes, let's do a main topic
 'cause I got a wedding to get to.
  </li><li>All right, our main topic this week
 comes from a question that was sent in a couple of weeks ago
 by an anonymous listener.
  </li><li>Hello anonymous.
  </li><li>And she asks us,
 As I was listening to your teaching about baptism, my question of baptism of the Holy Spirit surfaced
 all over again. I grew up in a more conservative tradition and I was baptized in the name of the
 Father of the Son of the Holy Spirit. I see evidence of the Holy Spirit in my life daily and I hear
 his voice for me and by grace as prophetic words for others. However, I have not experienced the
 the more charismatic expressions of the Holy Spirit personally, things like tongues, visions,
 healing, etc. I want to, and I do pray to, I feel fully saved and assured of a glorious
 eternity through Jesus, and once saved always saved like Alan, but I feel like I'm missing
 something. So the question is baptism of the Holy Spirit connected to water baptism? If
 you see evidence of the Holy Spirit in your life, do you still need baptism of the Holy
 disparate. How does one go about that? It is still such a nebulous concept to me. Thanks
 for any thoughts on this. I think the first thing I want to say is it was a really nebulous
 concept to me too. So when I read your question anonymous, I go back, I don't know, 20 years
 plus, so I remember having exactly the same questions. And because you, you asked some
 great questions in there. But because you ask a bunch of them, I'm going to slightly change your
 question and then add some more to it. So I want to rephrase your question as, what is the baptism
 of the Holy Spirit? Well, the baptism of the Holy Spirit is actually something the Bible is really
 clear about. Yeah. Like if you, if you read the Gospels in all four Gospels, which is interesting,
 John the Baptist talks about the baptism of the Holy Spirit. So in Matthew, Mark and Luke,
 He basically says a variation of the same thing where he's contrasting his ministry with Jesus'
 ministry. So it's that famous line of like, "I baptize with water, but one who's more powerful than me."
  </li><li>Baptizes with the Holy Spirit and fire. - Exactly, right. And I'll put the verses
 to anything I say, verse-wise, I'll put links to in the show notes. So that's Matthew Mark,
 and look, in John's gospel, we actually find out how John knew that. And he says this in John 1,
 verse 33, he said, "I would not have known him, i.e. the person who does these things, except that the
 one who sent me to baptize with water told me the man on whom you see the spirit come down and remain
 is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit." So, like it is a biblical term, baptism, the Holy
 Spirit. I don't know how I missed it my whole life. Like I'd never heard of that. And you might
 have heard my story. I went to a church in Scotland. I was in my early to mid 20s.
 And the past of there, I think this was probably the first time I ever heard anybody talk about
 baptism in the Holy Spirit. He said, hey, if anybody hasn't been baptized in the Holy Spirit,
 come forward for prayer. And the friends I'd gone with were all like really eager for me to go
 forward. But I was super confused because A, I had been baptized in water. B, I knew I had the
 the Holy Spirit and see, I'd never heard the phrase baptized,
 no, Holy Spirit before.
 So I remember arguing with them and like,
 I have been baptized and I have the Holy Spirit.
 And, you know, it was confusing to me.
 So when you ask the question, like, you know,
 what is the baptism of Holy Spirit?
 Is it the same as water baptism, et cetera?
 I totally get that.
 But let me, let me step back for a second and talk about
 because, because anonymous, when you ask that question,
 you said a similar thing to me, which is basically like,
 I know I have the Holy Spirit and actually I can see the Holy Spirit at work.
 So like, do I need baptism of the Holy Spirit?
 And to be clear, all Christians do have the Holy Spirit.
 You can't get saved without the Holy Spirit.
 Right.
 Right.
 That would be the confusing thing.
 Like Jesus is really clear about that.
 Like in John 3, he says this, this is, remember Nicodemus comes to him and he's like, what do you mean being born again?
 Like, how does that happen?
 And Jesus says this, I tell the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he's
 born of water and the spirit. Flash gives birth to flesh, but the spirit gives birth to spirit.
 You should not be surprised at my saying you must be born again. So Jesus is basically saying
 that unless you're born naturally of flesh and born spiritually of the spirit, you can't get into
 heaven. So we're literally born again and the Holy Spirit comes and lives in us. But
 Whether you're aware of it or not.
 Whether you're aware of it or not.
 Yes.
 But there's a big difference between being born of the spirit
 and being baptized with Holy Spirit.
 Yeah.
 And I don't know what kind of,
 well, no, you did say in your question,
 you said you grew up in a conservative tradition.
 And here's the thing, conservative evangelicals,
 which sounds like your background, certainly my background,
 would argue that receiving and being filled with the Holy Spirit
 are the same thing.
 But I would argue from scripture and my own personal experience that there are actually two separate events.
 Like one happens when we get saved, like we receive the Holy Spirit at that point.
 And to be clear, every Christian, just like you said, AJ, has the Holy Spirit.
 The other, being baptized in the Holy Spirit or being filled with the Holy Spirit, happens subsequently.
 Now, to further complicate this, only a little bit, there is nothing to stop the two happening simultaneously.
 Right. But in most Christians lives that I've talked to, they got saved and then they get filled
 with the Holy Spirit. And I'm using filled with the Holy Spirit being baptized with the Holy Spirit,
 being baptized in the Holy Spirit as all. The same. Exactly. Even that though, I had found confusing.
 Like I'm like, Oh, I know I'm filled with the Holy Spirit. I don't know if I'm baptized with
 the Holy Spirit. And for me, the stumbling part was tongues. Well, we're going to get to tongues
 in a second. It is interesting to know that right now my cute wife has turned her headphones
 upside down, and is wearing them as a headphone beard.
 I did good. Well, because my hair is up on my head like Heidi, it's killing me. It was
 sitting on top of this braid thing and I feel like somebody's crushing my head.
 Well, you look very cute. Well, thanks. Well, time out for a second. Let's just be very,
 very, very clear, all Christians have the Holy Spirit.
 Yes.
 Like you can't be saved without the Holy Spirit.
 Yes.
 Only some have been baptized with the Holy Spirit.
 Yes.
 Though all can be and should be.
 Yes.
 Right.
 Well, do we want to shut on people?
 You would you do want to be?
 Well, yes.
 And I what I love about anonymous, you're asking this question going, you know,
 I think I already have the Holy Spirit because, you know, I hear his voice daily
 and I can brops.
 I yeah, but I'm also aware that there's some lack in my life.
 and I want this.
 I can relate to that.
 I can totally relate to that.
 Let me, before I kind of breeze on though and answer those bigger questions of like,
 well, how do you and what does it look like and how does tongues fit into this?
 I want to, I think the teacher in me wants to demonstrate clearly from scripture the
 difference between being born of the spirit and being filled with the spirit.
 Do it.
 All right.
 Well, demonstrate it.
 Your great example is Jesus.
 He's a great example of many things.
 Right.
 He was quite literally born of the spirit.
 Right.
 You remember when the angel comes to Mary and he said, Hey, you're going to have a child.
 And she's like, I can this be?
 I'm a virgin.
 Look one verse 35.
 The angel answered the Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will
 overshadow you.
 So the Holy one to be born will be called the son of God.
 So we know that the house she gets pregnant is through the Holy spirit.
 Jesus is literally born of the Holy spirit.
 But what's interesting, and we kind of talked about this already, is when Jesus goes to get baptized by John,
 in Matthew chapter three, he gets baptized and the Holy Spirit descends upon him.
 Right?
 So my question is, why would he need to receive the Holy Spirit when he already has the Holy Spirit?
 Right.
 Right.
 He was born of the Spirit.
 Why did the Holy Spirit needed to send upon him and settle on him as Matthew 16 says?
 After his baptism, as Jesus came out of the water, the heavens were open, then he saw the spirit of God
 descend like a dove and settling on him. And a voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved son,
 and I'm fully pleased with him." Why? Because I think, you know, this is a great example of Jesus
 being born of the Holy Spirit, but also being anointed with, filled with, receiving the Holy Spirit.
 And I would say he's receiving the Holy Spirit like there was a time he was without it, but it is a
 subsequent revisiting of the Holy Spirit on Jesus' life.
 Yes.
 Same thing with the disciples, right?
 The disciples are with Jesus.
 It's interesting to know at what point did they get saved.
 But interestingly, in John 20, verse 19, it, this is when Jesus
 has been resurrected and all the disciples are freaking out.
 Right.
 This is preceding acts to that's called foreshadowing, by the way, John 20.
 Jesus come and stood among them. All the doors are locked for fear of the Jews.
 Jesus stood among them and said, "Peace be with you."
 And after he said this, he showed them his hands and his side and the disciples
 were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.
 Verse 21, again, Jesus said, "Peace be with you.
 As the Father has sent me, I am sending you."
 And with that, he breathed on them and he said,
 "Receive the Holy Spirit."
 Yeah.
 So they received the Holy Spirit in John 20.
 Right?
 I think it's fair to say they're Christians at that point.
 Right?
 They believe that Jesus is the risen Lord.
  </li><li>I think that spirit is saying.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>If they understand He's paid the price for their sin,
 and according to scripture, they receive the Holy Spirit.
 Well, you know where I'm going,
 'cause I already mentioned it,
 if you flip over to Acts two, the day of Pentecost,
 the disciples are sitting there,
 and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit comes in
 in a new way, and they're filled with the Holy Spirit.
 And so we know the story about that,
 verse four of Acts two says,
 "All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit,
 and began to speak in other tongues as the Holy Spirit enabled them.
 Yeah.
 So same parent as Jesus.
 They're born again and they received the Holy Spirit.
 Yet they are also filled with the Holy Spirit.
 Yeah.
 You got time for one more?
 Really good.
 Yeah, sure.
 All right.
 Acts 8, a couple of interested ones in Acts 8.
 For time, I'm just going to talk about the one in Acts 8.
 This is believers who are in Samaria.
 It says this, "Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ there.
 And when the crowds heard Philip and saw the miraculous signs he did,
 They all paid close attention to what he said. With shrieks, evil spirits came out of many,
 and many paralytics and cripples were healed. So there was great joy in that city. Verse 12,
 they believed Philip as he preached the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ,
 they were baptized both men and women. So this is a great revival happening in the city in Samaria,
 where Philip preaches, people believe they get baptized and they give their lives to Jesus, right?
 He's preaching the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ.
 And these people are baptized.
 Yeah, but in Acts four acts, eight verse 14, it says this, when the apostles and Jerusalem heard
 that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.
 And when they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit,
 because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them.
 They'd simply been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
 Then Peter and John placed their hands on them and they received a Holy Spirit.
 Similar pattern.
 Again, these people who've responded to the gospel of Jesus Christ who believe
 who were baptized, they are subsequently prayed for the Holy Spirit.
 It says they received the Holy Spirit.
 And that's really my experience.
 I got saved when I was seven, but I didn't meet the Holy Spirit until I was 24.
 And again, I couldn't have been saved without the leading of the Holy Spirit.
 let the quickening of my heart, without responding to that.
 And I knew of the Holy Spirit, but when I was 24 and got baptized in the Holy Spirit,
 everything in my life changed.
 Yeah.
 Which leads us to one of the questions anonymous is kind of asking,
 which is, how do I know I've been baptized with the Holy Spirit?
 And the most common answer to that, the ones that Pentecostal's whole two is...
 Tongues.
 [Laughs]
 Although that's not the only evidence of being baptized with the Holy Spirit.
 It's not. It's a good answer. And I quite like the answer, but you're quite right,
 because out of the five times in the book of Acts where it mentions baptism, the Holy Spirit,
 only three of them refer to speaking in tongues as the sign. There are other signs that accompany
 the baptism. Yes. Right. So biblically, I want to say you want to be careful in stating that it
 has to be tongues. And here's why. For me, I got baptized in the Holy Spirit, but it was
 probably six or seven months later that I spoke in tongues. And for me, it was a couple of years
 later. Right. So you got baptized in the Holy Spirit and for a couple of years, you didn't speak
 in tongues. What happened in between that time? Well, I mean, I was prophesying. I could hear the
 word really clearly. And I could feel the Holy Spirit on me. I got healed. I prayed for others
 for healing and they got healed but I didn't speak in tongues.
 Right.
 And I even had like a bunch of really awkward moments of people.
 Well-meaning people.
 Well-meaning people standing around me like essentially yelling at me in tongues which
 yelling at me never does anything good for me anyway.
 You know, then they'd say just say this.
 Shoot a photo on the.
 Yeah, like manufactured, you know, and I was like, oh, I can't, you know, and for me it
 It was like, yeah, a couple of years later
 that I started speaking in tongues.
  </li><li>You know, you were a couple of years,
 I was a couple of months.
 I'm convinced that I could have spoken in tongues
 way earlier, it's just I didn't know how,
 I didn't even know what it was.
 I wasn't even sure if I believed in it.
 But here's why I would still say that tongues
 is an evidence of baptism of the Holy Spirit.
  </li><li>Oh, it is.
  </li><li>Is that I could have, I just didn't know how to.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think that was the same thing for me.
 I didn't know how to either.
 And I think, again, when some people were helpfully saying,
 well, just say this, like, this is my tongue, say this,
 that to me didn't feel like authentic or integrous.
 And you know, like, I was just like, like, you know--
  </li><li>You're like, I feel more of your passion for me
 to speak in tongues than the Holy Spirit's empowerment
 right now. - Yeah, and I also felt like,
 guys, I, you know, pretty good.
 Like, I do know I'm baptized in the Holy Spirit.
 So I'm okay to wait.
 And actually I didn't start speaking in tongues
 until I was at a meeting where Mary Audrey Raycroft
 was doing this women's meeting.
 And she asked, you know, does anybody want to come up?
 And she said, we're not going to surround you,
 start yelling at you in tongues, whatever.
 And I'm like, oh, so this is everybody else's
 common experience too.
  </li><li>It was my experience.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And so there was like six or seven of us that came up.
 And when she came over, she just like,
 would lightly, was praying for me.
 And she said, "A.J., you love to sing,
 "just sing whatever you hear."
 And I was like, "Okay."
 And she's like, "And if it doesn't make sense,
 "don't try and make it make sense right now."
 She says, "Or just start singing about how much you love him
 "and see what happens."
 And so I just started singing,
 and I ended up singing in tongues.
 And that's how I started speaking in tongues.
  </li><li>Doesn't surprise me that you started
 with singing in tongues before you moved to speaking in tongues.
  </li><li>Yeah, well, there you go.
  </li><li>Yeah, I was the reverse.
 Maybe we should do an episode on tongues.
  </li><li>Well, that's my only tongue stories.
 It might be a short episode.
  </li><li>All right, well, how do you know?
 I knew even before I spoke in tongues,
 I can describe my life pre-bapses
 in the Holy Spirit and post-bapses below.
  </li><li>Yeah, for sure.
  </li><li>So it was a defining mark in my life.
 And so I would encourage everybody who's listening
 that one of the ways, like you'll know,
 like you won't be in doubt.
 And if you are in doubt,
 it might be that you haven't been baptized
 in the Holy Spirit.
 Is that a fair way to say that?
  </li><li>Well, I don't know 'cause I would say I,
 because I was told that tongues was the only way to know,
 I would say I was in doubt,
 and I absolutely was baptized in the Holy Spirit
 based on all the other evidences.
 So it sort of depends on what you've been told as well,
 I think.
 Yeah.
 And also your culture.
 Yeah.
 I just know for me it was a stark contrast.
 Yeah.
 Like I knew I had the Holy Spirit before and then I started living like I did.
 Yeah.
 Gotcha.
 Well, I mean, probably the big question everybody's asking is, well, if I am in or
 even I want to be doubly sure.
 Did you say "ammit"?
 Yeah.
 I'm, it's my southern.
 It's that southern.
 That's like, so I'm going to wear a Scottish word, "ammit".
 If I am it, that's like am, apo-trophy not, am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-am-amjust 
 be in a posture of receiving and ask the Holy Spirit to come because he wants to come.
 Yeah, because, biblically, there's no set way. No. Like in both Jesus' case and disciples in Acts
 2, the Holy Spirit fell on people sovereignly. Yes. Right? The Holy Spirit descended, the heavens
 poured, it's sent upon Jesus in Acts 2. It was, you know, wild. In my case, and in what you're
 describing, and in others in the Bible, you can receive prayer for it. Yeah. But here's what I
 I would say then we can touch on this already often the exuberance of others who've received the Holy Spirit and
 Possibly in their immaturity. There's a tremendous pressure
 To receive the the bad for the Holy Spirit where people are like do you feel it? Okay now try speaking tongues?
 Okay now just do this yeah, and I'm like I'm like you I'm like on
 Wind it all yeah, and I like to fall back on look 11 11 where Jesus is speaking
 Precisely about the Holy Spirit
 He says, "Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?
 Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?
 If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much
 more will your father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?"
 I used to think that being baptized or being filled with the Holy Spirit took effort on
 my part and actually it's just a posture of receiving.
 because your heavenly father absolutely wants to fill you with the Holy Spirit.
 Absolutely.
 And you're not going to get a counterfeit, you're not going to get a demon if you do
 this. And I thought, babe, it would be fun if we prayed for people to receive baptism,
 the Holy Spirit via the podcast right now.
 All right.
 Let's do that.
 So I'm going to let AJ pray for you in a second, but I'm going to give you some instructions
 that AJ started with. Like wherever you are right now, don't do this while driving, like
 maybe pull over and but close your eyes.
  </li><li>Yeah, definitely don't do well driving.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>And if you need something to do,
 turn your palms up, just like in a posture
 like you're gonna receive.
 Close your eyes, breathe just deeply and calmly,
 and just get into a posture like God's going to answer
 the prayer that age is going to pray,
 'cause he's good and he loves you and he's for you.
 So, age, pray for everybody right now
 to be baptized in the Holy Spirit.
 All right.
 Well, Holy Spirit, right now for each person that's listening,
 Lord, I ask that you would come,
 or that you would fill them up from the tops of their heads
 to the tips of their toes,
 or that you would just absolutely saturate
 and soak them in your presence,
 and that they would feel you with them,
 that they would feel you resting on them.
 Lord, we breathe you in right now.
 take you in. And we know that when we ask you for bread, you don't give us a stone. So we're
 asking for the Holy Spirit to come and fill us. And Lord, I pray for those of us who are wondering,
 I don't know if I've received the Holy Spirit or not Lord that you would just minister peace to
 our heart Lord. I thank you that the foundational presence of God is peace. Yeah. And so Lord,
 I just ask that you would increase peace.
 And even as, you know, we're praying for you just now, pay attention to what your body's
 doing, pay attention to any heat, any tingling, any sensation in your body and focus on that.
 Cause that's probably the Holy Spirit at work in your life right now.
 And so Lord, we ask that you would baptize everybody who's listening right now in the
 Holy Spirit.
 You'd fill them up from the soles of their feet to the top of their head completely submerged
 with the Holy Spirit, because we know that you father would love to give the Holy Spirit
 to those who ask you for him. And Lord, I thank you for the signs that follow, Lord,
 those that believe, Lord. And without any pressure, Lord, I ask that you would just impart spiritual
 gifts to people who are listening right now. Thank you.
 Tongues and prophecy and gifts of healing, gifts of faith. Yeah. That people would have
 have a marked difference, Lord, between pre being baptized in the Holy Spirit and being
 filled with the Holy Spirit. And the people have the confidence, Lord, that they're not
 just born of the spirit, but they're filled with the Holy Spirit. And I ask all these
 things in the name of Jesus. Amen. Amen.
 I think I'd love to encourage you as you're pursuing the Holy Spirit and as you're just
 allowing him to fill you one of your best tools for that is learning how to soak and
 learning how to just keep in this mode of receiving. And we've done a number of different podcasts
 on soaking. We'll try and tag some of those in the notes for you if you're not clear
 on what that is. But just for many of us, the hardest thing to do is to stay in a position
 of receiving and not analyzing. And often we can stop something before it starts by getting
 to in our heads. And so my thought is if you could practice soaking, that's also going
 to help you practice receiving. So that was my thought as you were praying.
 Yeah. All right. Well, thank you, Anonymous, for that great question. Next week, I think
 we're going to talk about speaking in tongues. What is how it happens, what you do with it.
 I'm maybe a j's tummy can grumble in tongues too.
 I wonder if they're going to hear it on the posca.
 It was so loud when you were praying.
 I was like, oh my goodness.
 It's crazy.
 Well, speaking in touch.
 Thank you for joining us this week.
