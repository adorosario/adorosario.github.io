<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to episode one sixty four of keeping up with the jones is this week we talk broken chains how to make decisions and review our listeners feedback plus a sneaky surprise at the end.
 But as usual let's start here a judge on how the heck are you i'm so good how are you baby you're using a baby voice to read using a cute voice there.
 Well let's go to you and your cute i tried this track day effect i have on my wife ladies and gentlemen it's true it's true well let's talk about the week babe okay so monday oh yeah monday was trauma day i start off well yeah yeah labor day so.
 Tia had been asking to go to Nashville Shores for about a week or something.
 Nashville Shores being a water park up in Nashville.
 Yes, then we have passes for. And so I was like, yeah, baby, well, we'll see if we can,
 we'll see if we can. And then some friends of ours were going. And so we decided to go.
 And I went without you. You were going to get work done.
 Yeah, I don't remember what I did.<br/>
 You're working on the Finding Father stuff.
 Oh, yeah, that's right. Almost done, folks. Almost done.
 And I took all three children to the park.
 About 10 minutes after arriving at the park, Tia split her chin open.
 Good times.<br/>
 And I froze.<br/>
 Yeah, you totally froze.<br/>
 I totally froze.<br/>
 I didn't know what to do.<br/>
 I held a towel over her bleeding chin as it gushed down the front of her body.
 And I froze and I'd probably still be standing there if it wasn't for
 Shaley Ratliff coming and rescuing me and helping me think.
 So are you freaked out by blood?<br/>
 I don't like blood.<br/>
 Oh, you don't know.<br/>
 I, I, well, I don't mind if it's me.<br/>
 Like I don't mind if I get hurt, but my kids bleeding.
 Yeah, can't handle that at all.<br/>
 I can do vomit or poop, but not not blood.
 If you're a new listener to keeping up with the Joneses, it's like this every week.
 So yeah.<br/>
 So just so you know, for future reference, blood, that's your job.
 Okay.<br/>
 Got it.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Perfect.<br/>
 So you end up going to a physician.<br/>
 Yep, we went to like an urgent care kind of place and I
 How was your experience there babe?<br/>
 It was pretty horrific actually.<br/>
 The do-tell.<br/>
 So we got there and the doctor, I mean, the staff was all very sweet and everything.
 But the doctor was like, you know, we should stitch it.
 And I said, well, my only concern with that is that freezing doesn't work on me.
 And it didn't work on our sister because I remember having to hold Abby down in Australia.
 and it didn't work on my dad.<br/>
 And if freezing doesn't work on her.
</p><ul>
  <li>By freezing, you mean like local anesthetic.
  </li><li>Right, like using a needle to freeze the area
 so that you can sew it up.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Doesn't work.
 I have felt every stitch I've ever had in my entire life.
 So anyway, she said, well, that's not possible.
 Freezing works on everyone.
 And I was like, I assure you, it doesn't.
 And so we tried to have this calm conversation
 while an eight year old is listening to us.
 And then I said, can you just glue it?
 And she said, well, it'll have a bigger scar,
 but I can glue it and I said, well,
 I think that will probably be better
 since I don't know if it will work on her.
  </li><li>And at this time, you're texting me
 'cause you're feeling like you're gonna pass out.
  </li><li>No, it wasn't until after what happened next.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So I'm doing okay, sort of,
 if I just ignore the fact that every time Tia talks,
 the little slit talks as well.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Yuck.
 And so then, she says, okay, I'm gonna glue it
 and she gets her to put her chin back and whatever,
 which actually, I don't know how you glue it
 with her chin back because that stretches it open.
 But anyway, that's not the point.
 And she glues her fingers to Tia's face.
 (laughs)
 Like she glues the gloves to Tia's face.
 And then she has to pull the gloves off,
 thus pulling the incision apart.
 And then it froze like that.
  </li><li>And that's the part where you wanted to pass out.
  </li><li>Yes, 'cause I'm in Tia screaming
 after we told her this wasn't gonna hurt.
 And the thing is now absolutely glued open
 instead of closed.
 And it was like the doctor wanted to pretend
 it didn't just happen like that.
 And then she just put like a million
 stair strips over.
 I'm like too late lady, you just glued it open.
 So the thing bled all day and then all night.
  </li><li>So then you're texting with Cindy
 our pediatric nurse friend.
  </li><li>Yes.
 And Cindy's like coming to the hospital,
 they will sedate her and then they'll get it off.
 They probably can't get the glue off,
 but maybe they can, you know, whatever.
 And I'm just like, I honestly don't know
 if I can take the trauma of trying to do that
 for the difference of a--
  </li><li>And I was a voice of calm through this whole thing.
  </li><li>Well, okay.
  </li><li>Wait, you don't remember that?
 I was completely calm through the whole thing.
  </li><li>You may have been.
 I felt like a nerve ending, like somebody was, I don't know,
 I felt completely traumatized for like two days.
  </li><li>You know, the end of this podcast,
 we should replay the trauma prayer about Patton's campaign.
  </li><li>Hey, we should.
  </li><li>Pretty tough trauma of everybody.
  </li><li>For everybody that had to hear it.
  </li><li>But honestly, by the time she came home,
 she was fine.
 I mean, she was calm.
  </li><li>She was fine when she was still bleeding.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, she was.
  </li><li>But she shouldn't have been if they'd actually gotten it together.
  </li><li>All right, all right.
 Well, it wasn't my fault.
 So that was Monday.
  </li><li>That was Monday.
  </li><li>The week could only get better.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And it did.
  </li><li>It did.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Tuesday was our orientation.
  </li><li>It was.
  </li><li>Which means all of our new school students
 and our returning students for year two
 showed up at church.
 and we got to meet them all, have lunch with them,
 they got to meet their small group.
 And it was amazing.
  </li><li>It was awesome.
  </li><li>If you're a student who is attending SSL this year,
 we're super excited to meet you.
 If we didn't get a chance to say hello to you,
 we're so glad to get to spend the next eight months with you
 and we'll try and make sure we say hello to everyone this week.
 Now, the trauma wasn't over because the poor staff member
 who ran that doctor's office gave you a courtesy call on Tuesday.
  </li><li>Yeah, probably not expecting my response.
 "This is Jones, this is Susan here from Doctors Urgent Care.
 "Just wanted to have follow up courtesy call,
 "to see how Tia was, and do I trust that you have
 "had an amazing experience with her doctors?"
 And you said, "Are you freaking kidding me?"
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And you basically told her what you just told us.
  </li><li>I just told her the whole story,
 and I said, "And it's still bleeding."
  </li><li>And she, bless her, was just petrified.
  </li><li>Yeah, so she put me onto the office manager,
 and the office manager was like,
 "Let me talk to the doctor that's here today.
 "It's a different doctor.
 He's been a doctor for ages, which I'm sure he has.
 And he was lovely, but anyway, he said, bring her in
 and I'll try and convince her, let me look at it.
 And he managed to get all the staring strips off
 without her really fighting him much at all.
  </li><li>Well, that was preceded by Tia,
 us taking her in and saying, okay, Tia,
 the doctor wants to have a look at your chin.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And Tia looks at us just cold in the eyes
 and just says, what am I gonna get for it?
 I was like well honey what do you mean she's like I want twenty five dollars cash cash cash
 so the doctor just said that Tia when you grow up I want you to go into mergers and acquisitions
 because then the negotiation skills like that you'll do very very well it was very funny
 but anyway they took it off and kind of cleaned up and yeah but I mean it was too late because
 the glue had already I think it looks great okay it's fine plus it's underneath your
 I posted it on Instagram. If anybody's really interested, it's in my Instagram stories.
 But I know Wednesday go better.
 Wednesday got better.
 You're doing an art class.
 I am. The reason I know this is every time I open up the trunk.
 This is a new painting in the backseat.
 And I'm like, what's happening?
 This come from. Yeah.
 Are you enjoying it?
 I am. I mean, what I'm trying to do is just have fun being creative and not care.
 if it's perfect or if it looks like it could be hung up anywhere.
 Good.
 Yes.
 All right.
 So bonus, which is a challenge for me.
 What are you going to do with that?
 I kind of want to burn them all, but I'm not right now.
 And about what are you going to do with them?
 I don't know.
 Because they're physical, tangible objects.
 When I create things that...
 Well, I'll probably trash them at some point,
 but for right now, I'm choosing not to trash them,
 even though they're not beautiful, just to sit in the fact that I'm
 I'm being creative, even if it's not perfect.
  </li><li>They by applaud your creative, but not perfect.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>It says here in the show notes,
 "Friday, caviar, and bananas."
 Could you help me with that?
  </li><li>Yes, I ate caviar and banana, I was just kidding.
 I met a friend for lunch on Friday
 at a new sort of market type restaurant in Nashville
 called Caviar and Bananas.
  </li><li>Would I like it?
  </li><li>You would.
  </li><li>Oh, good.
  </li><li>Well, it's kind of like March&Atilde;&copy; in Toronto,
 like, but nowhere near that size.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Like nowhere near that size.
 But there's a salad station and there's like a cheese station.
  </li><li>Do you mean I have to go get my own food?
  </li><li>Yeah, and then you like pay for it,
 then you sit down and drink coffee and stuff.
  </li><li>I go out so that people bring food to me.
  </li><li>Well, I know, but they have lots of good gluten-free things.
  </li><li>Oh, good thing.
  </li><li>They have like Franklin Jew stuff there.
 And so they have like quite the selection of stuff.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>But the parking garage that is attached to it,
 that you get validated parking.
 I don't know who designed it,
 but I would call it, it's a Tesla garage.
 Because if your car does not have the summon feature,
 you are not getting out of your car.
 There is not enough space to be able to open the doors.
 It's like a European came in and went,
 "I think I'll do this one."
 (laughs)
  </li><li>At this point I'd like to apologize to all the Europeans
 listening, she means no harm.
  </li><li>Whoever designed it thinks we all drive smart cars.
 And then it's Tennessee and everybody drives like a Yukon.
 And it's insane.
 just like, are you kidding me?
 Anyway, me who I like parking and I'm not worried about parking garages.
 I'm like, I will never, I will never park there again.
 What? Who likes parking?
 I like all things cars.
 Well, forget going to like your art class.
 Just go to parking.
 Spend the evening parallel parking and reverse parking.
 Well, that's not as creative.
 Can I paint the car first?
 You know, Saturday was a fun day for me.
 Yes.
 because I spent six hours.
 And when I say I, I mean, my friend Neil, who's an
 electrician spent six hours with me rewiring our upstairs.
 Yeah.
 And I wanted some power outlets in different places than was
 previously available.
 And Neil's like, Oh, no problem.
 We'll just go into the attic and we'll just drill through, just run
 some new lines.
 And I'm like, Oh, okay.
 Now I'm scared of electricity.
 He's not right, but he, you know, again, six hours later, we managed
 to hang two TVs.
 So what's great now is up in the bonus room,
 the kids have got a nice big TV,
 which also means I have a nice big TV
 'cause that's where the Nintendo is.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And Mario Kart on a 65 inch TV is a thing of joy.
  </li><li>Ooh, I'll have to try that.
 I quite like Mario Kart.
 It's the only one I like.
  </li><li>Who are you and what have you done
 with my wife, you imposter?
  </li><li>Out of all the games,
 that one and the Just Dance game are my favorite ones.
  </li><li>I have literally never seen you play Mario Kart.
  </li><li>I played with the kids, darling.
  </li><li>Okay, after this, forget it.
 We're going to go play Mario Kart.
 All right, I'll bring you down.
 I would like to see that.
 Okay.
 Well, that's probably not going to happen because you play it too much.
 Right.
 But anyway, we have, but I won't come in 12th.
 We have a gorgeous TV hanging up.
 Thank you, Neil, for making that reality.
 And then if you ever come stay with us in the guest room, you now have your own flat
 panel TV that pivots and so no matter where you are, if you're in the sitting
 area of the room, you can pivot it over there.
 If you're in bed, you can watch it in bed.
 I'm very, my producers are super happy.
 Yeah.
 So that was Saturday.
 Well, almost I had a run in with my garden.
 This is a 12 minute.
 Hi, I'm sorry, but people need to know about the garden.
 Go on.
 OK, so basically, as I was stepping into the garden
 to tie up some tomato plants where the bunnies can't get them,
 I somehow hooked my foot over this pole,
 and it ended up pulling me over and out of the garden,
 and then I stabbed my leg with a pole.
 So I have a little gash and a bruise.
 Which I think is affected.
 Affected or infected?
 No, it isn't.
 OK, don't just ignore all my pre-med training.
 OK, I will.
 All right.
 And so, yeah, I have a wound, a wound that is healing.
 And we ate our first watermelon and it was revolting.
 Before we move on to our main topic.
 Yes.
 It is worth noting that this morning's message by Jeff
 dollar was unbelievable.
 It was fantastic.
 It was so good.
 He killed it.
 Well, he was like, but everybody was so quiet.
 I was like, Jeff, I couldn't write down notes fast enough for the revelation you're
 auditioning for real.
 It was so, so good.
 I'll put a link in the show notes.
 I'd highly recommend you listen to it.
 It was phenomenal.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Our main topic for this week is all about making decisions.
 And what I love about this week is you're leading it.
 And I haven't even read the show notes for this.
 So you were all talking about, I want to talk about making decisions.
 And I'm like, I would love to hear what we have to share about making decisions.
 So take it away, Mr. Jones.
  </li><li>Well, I was thinking, you know, while obviously
 we are married and so we make decisions
 based on being married and what our life looks like,
 a single person would make decisions differently.
 So I thought I'd tackle it from sort of both perspectives
 or that, you know, if we can sort of think back
 to single days and how we made decisions then
 and then talk also about how we make decisions
 as a married person.
  </li><li>All right, go for it.
 So I might just start with being single.
 So a lot of the stuff that you're making decisions about
 when you're single is not just,
 I mean, there's your day to day stuff, you know,
 like what are you gonna eat and all that kind of stuff?
 I don't think you really need wisdom on that.
 Eat whatever you want.
 Have fun.
 Tacos, there you go, that's decided for you.
 But you would think about stuff like
 how do you spend your money
 and you're the only person that's making that decision,
 but you're also the only person
 that suffers the consequences of that decision.
 Or how do you spend your time?
 Also, the only one who's maybe potentially the benefit,
 but also suffering the consequences of it.
 So it's different in a marriage
 where you could potentially have somebody that goes,
 "Hey, we're not gonna spend on that,"
 or "Let's budget this way because there's somebody else
 "who has a say when you're single,
 "you're the sole person responsible for the decision."
 and it can feel like there's a lot of pressure in that.
  </li><li>I don't, well, here's, I wouldn't trust my memory.
 I was gonna say, I don't remember feeling pressure,
 but then I don't really remember things.
 I just tend to move on,
 so I probably have to be quiet for this part, but go on.
  </li><li>So it's just thinking like,
 when I would decide if I was going to get an apartment
 or you're budgeting everything on your own,
 you're trying to run the numbers on your own,
 and then figure out, like, can I do this?
 And if you make that decision, you're in it on your own.
 Like there's not somebody else there
 that's believing in faith for you
 for whatever to turn that.
 Does that make sense?
 And so like I remember when I ended up getting
 this apartment by the church
 and it was the first sort of expensive-ish place
 that I had gotten.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And it was only $750 a month.
 So it's not like it was like hugely, hugely expensive.
 But I was not making that much money a year.
 I was making like $26,000 a year or something.
 But I had to live somewhere and I just had to make the decision.
 And I remember feeling like I am terrified.
 I am making the wrong decision.
 But at some point you have to remember, okay, the Holy Spirit does speak to me.
 And there's very few decisions in life that you can't somehow get help with or get out
 if you've made a bad one.
 That was almost the best piece of advice I've ever heard about making decisions.
 When John, John Arnett said, you know, Ellen, nearly every decision you make can can almost be undone.
 Yeah.
 And I was like, wow, that helps.
 Yeah.
 So I sort of went into getting that apartment, wanting to live by myself and wanting this space.
 But thinking if I had to, I have a second bedroom, I can, you know, I can get a roommate if I have to.
 And this way I can try it and just see if it works.
 If it doesn't work, I'm okay.
 I have a little bit of a cushion to figure that out.
 But what I was thinking is I didn't make that decision
 on my own.
 I actually invited other people that know me well,
 that know my life, the pace of my life,
 whether I would be good with roommates,
 all that kind of stuff into the process with me
 and considered all of their opinions
 while I'm moving forward with making a decision.
 Does that make sense?
 And then I started thinking about when, um, when I got the matrix.
 So I bought this Toyota matrix.
 Oh, you loved your Toyota matrix.
 I did. I did.
 I actually leased it.
 I shouldn't say I bought it.
 I leased it.
 And, um, it was when I was completely living by faith.
 So here I am traveling for the church in Toronto and really you have no
 guarantees of income.
 Right.
 You have no salary.
 most salary. And, you know, I had gone through a season where I literally had a lemon and a
 catch-up package in my, you know, in my fridge. And I was like, well, I guess I'm fasting to the
 next church, you know? And so it was sort of like, oh, you know, but I didn't have a car. And when I
 was home, I was sort of stuck. And this opportunity came up because there was a guy in town that
 gave a deal to people in full-time ministry.
 And he gave me an amazing deal.
 But I remember running the numbers and thinking, okay, I can probably,
 I can probably do $250 a month.
 I can probably do this.
 Right.
 But even though it looked good to me, I asked John if he would come to the
 dealership with me and meet the dealer guy and just see what he felt,
 you know, before I went ahead and did it.
 And so he did.
 He met the guy and saw the car and whatever.
 And I don't think John's an expert on cars or anything,
 but John was an expert on people and that's what I needed.
 You know, and so I think even when you're single,
 if you can invite other people into the process
 that you trust, then it's actually a little bit easier
 to make the decisions.
 So that was one of the things I thought about.
  </li><li>Yeah, and to this day, that's something we still do,
 isn't it?
 We still have wise counsel on every decision we make because I've learned I don't actually
 want my own way.
 Right.
 Not at the expense of what it could cost you for making a decision.
 No, wisdom is so much more worthy than anything else.
 And so I love asking the people in my life.
 I trust.
 I remember when we bought our first types, I remember calling my father, who is the most
 prudent man.
 And I thought, there's no way my dad's going to go for this.
 And I think kind of like, like my dad was the ultimate mistest.
 If this, if my dad says yes, then this has to be the Lord, because, you know, I just
 watched him be very, very financially responsible.
 We were taking a bit of a risk.
 You know, what do you think?
 And my dad said the words, I think this is the Lord.
 And I was like, Oh my gosh, this is like double whammy.
 And I've always, I don't know if I've always.
 In recent memory, I've always wanted to include people in our decision-making process.
 Not because I can't make a decision.
 It's usually I've made a decision.
 This is what I think you're going to do.
 It's that first and probably was in the multitude of counselors to safety.
 Then in the midst of that process, don't be mad if they say, "Actually, I don't think
 that's a good decision," because that's what you're looking for.
 looking for all of the wisdom that you can get so that you can make a decision with all
 of that in front of you.
 So...
 Here's the thing, once you've got the feedback, it's still your decision to make.
 Yeah.
 And the reality is, if it goes south, it's not them who are going to bail you out.
 It's you.
 Yeah.
 Not that you have an expectation it's going to go south, but there is a tremendous joy
 that comes when those that you're spiritually accountable to are saying, "Yes, I think this
 as a Lord, you should go for it. There's like an unction on it. There's a supernatural
 whoosh. Look at me with all my... Look at you.
 But there is, there's something that's like, wow, this feels great. All this momentum,
 this feels great. Yeah. And I think that that's important too. Like, whether you're single
 or whether you're married, you're looking for what the Holy Spirit is kind of resting
 on. And then that makes it a lot easier to make a good decision, doesn't it?
 I like sleeping on decisions too.
 Yeah.
 It's amazing how putting time between an action distills a lot of noise.
 Yeah.
 As in, I, you know, I'm thinking, I'm going to make this decision or, you know,
 and there's just a hum of activity.
 And I think about some decisions I was trying to make maybe a month ago.
 And now like I can make that decision so easy.
 But at the time, you know, I was under pressure, you know, time, financial, whatever.
 Yeah.
 ultimately didn't make those decisions. And now I feel great about not making those decisions.
 But at the time, I was like, if I, you know, and I think like, John Paul Jackson used to say,
 peace is the pot and soil of revelation. Yeah. And well, there isn't peace. If there's
 frenetic accompaniment to it, I don't think it's going to end well.
 Yeah. And I think we want to be careful of all that false pressure. Again, like you say,
 sometimes we think the decision has to be made this very second. Very rarely is that the case.
 right, that it has to be made this very second.
 You know, more often than not actually you can get the space from it to talk
 to the Lord about it and to seek wisdom.
 And then you can actually feel better about the decision that you made.
 I think whether you're single or whether you're married, probably things
 like, how do you spend your money and how do you spend your time?
 You know, some of that is already determined for you.
 You know, some of your money is already spent.
  </li><li>Before you get it, you know, like you have taxes
 and you have tie, then you have rent
 and you have that kind of stuff, you know,
 and that's the same whether you're married
 or whether you're single.
 But I think either way, it's gonna come down
 to your priorities.
 And as a single person, you get to have that conversation
 with the Lord and establish your priorities on your own.
 And as a married couple, you're establishing
 typically priorities together
 about what the spendage looks like.
 And I would say it's the same thing with spending time.
 As a single person,
 you probably have a lot more time to spend
 and more freedom to figure that out as a married couple.
  </li><li>Yeah, you don't have somebody to consult.
  </li><li>Right.
 As a married couple,
 and certainly as parents,
 a lot of your time is spoken for
 because of the decision you made to have children.
 So there's that.
 And then the rest of it is negotiated, isn't it?
  </li><li>Well, is it negotiated?
 And negotiate sounds like you're having a fight for something.
  </li><li>No, I don't mean it in a negative,
 or scheduled perhaps.
 It's just sort of like, we know you're gonna have
 a certain amount of time on Fridays
 that you're gonna get to go do what you wanna do.
 And I'm also gonna get some time on Fridays to do what I wanna do
 so that we each get our own sort of personal time
 to just have fun unwind, be with people
 we wanna be with, whatever.
 But we also know Saturdays, hey, that's family day.
 And so because that's a priority and a choice
 that we've made, it also affects our time.
  </li><li>I was thinking we both got married,
 not terribly late in life.
 I got married when I was 30, you were 33.
 So we'd both established an independent way of life.
 But I don't remember it being difficult
 when we got married, making decisions.
  </li><li>Well, I mean, we would have moments
 where our shapers would collide for sure.
  </li><li>For sure.
  </li><li>Well, that's mainly because you were just completely,
 you know, behind us.
  </li><li>I'm just joking.
 And I couldn't finish the joke.
 That was the Holy Spirit.
 No, you're right.
 There were times when we both had plans.
 But overall, like, I remember somebody saying to me
 before we got married, this really negative thing.
 They said to me, you know, before you get married,
 make sure you buy everything you ever want to buy,
 'cause once you have a wife,
 they're not gonna be interested in the things
 you're interested. And that just hasn't been my experience. I married somebody who has very
 similar taste to me in that you'd rather have no TV than a bad TV.
 Yeah. I mean, I think one of the things we've both discovered about each other is we both
 would rather say for the thing that we actually do want than compromise and get something lesser.
 Right.
 And in terms of when we make decisions on spending money on things, typically it depends on what
 we're looking at, who's going to get the final decision on whatever the item is.
 I was thinking about this the other day, I remember our first TV that we bought,
 which is now actually in the guest room. It was not funny. I forget when we bought it. It would
 have been what 2006 maybe? Yeah. And so right then, high definition TVs are just coming on the
 the market. You could buy a 720 or you could buy a 1080 and the 1080 panels were obviously
 way more expensive. And I remember I did all my research, I found out, I mean, I've terrified
 to think what we paid for that back then. And we went shopping and I remember you saying,
 hey, there is no point in getting the 720. If the industry standard is going to look like it's
 going to go 1080, if we're buying this TV, it's not going to be the only TV we ever have, but
 it's going to get trickled down. I think it makes sense to have a high quality TV, especially with
 electronics that's by the best we can today, so that it ages gracefully. And the same with the size
 of it. We ended up buying a 42 inch, which today is very, very small. But we thought it was huge.
 It was enormous. They kind of capped out about 48, maybe 50 inches was the biggest TV ever. So 42
 back then was amazing. So we bought that what 11 years ago. It's still ticking. It's an amazing
 picture. It's fabulous for 1080 signals. I know you have now have 4K, but there's not a huge amount
 of 4K content. Anyway, my point is we bought something 11 years ago that we're still using today.
 And I just remember you saying, you may as well get the bigger and you may as well get the better
 one so that the technology ages gracefully. And I was like, in your face, my friend who tried to
 to tell me bio your technology before your wife,
 because that just doesn't be your experience.
  </li><li>Right, well I don't wanna buy two of something,
 like I don't wanna wear things out,
 I'd rather buy the better, save up,
 buy the better thing that's gonna last
 the longer amount of time.
 But I would say like generally speaking,
 if we're, I was thinking about, you know,
 we're talking about if we're buying something
 for the kitchen, you might have an opinion,
 you might do some research or whatever,
 but in the end, probably if it's for the kitchen,
 I'm going to make the decision because I'm going to be the one using it the most.
 Yeah, but the way you do it, babe, is which I love too, is you come and you say, okay,
 we need to insert whatever, like a new.
 Toaster oven.
 A new toaster oven.
 Sure.
 All right.
 So here's the top three that I found from, you know, checking the sweet home, checking, you know, wherever.
 This is, you know, good, better best.
 And this is the one I'd really, really like.
 Obviously it's the most expensive one.
 Here's why I think it's, you know, worth it.
 And you make a case, not that you're trying to twist my arm or you really you're submitting it saying, what do you think?
 Do you think this is a wise use of our money?
 And of course, I've got no vested interest in it.
 I don't, you know, you're the one that's done all the research, but in as part of that, you'll be like, this is why I think it's better because I
 this and I have that.
 And, you know, this is why I'd rather have, you know, this brand rather than that brand and, you know, here's the repair, blah, blah, blah, blah.
 And right.
 Yeah, it's sound and it's solid and it's like, yeah.
 Right.
 which is the same thing you do with the podcasting equipment or whatever.
 I mean, our deal is we don't even spend $20 without checking with the other one.
 Right.
 So that's because in times of our life, we haven't had $20 to spend.
 So it's been.
 But it's always kind of hung over and it's that lovely thing of the power of agreement,
 some of what Jeff was talking about this morning.
 And we had some friends over the other weekend.
 It was very funny.
 they were giving them a tour of the house and they walked into our bedroom and they were like,
 they said, "Do you, um, do you not like bedroom furniture?"
 Which was a very polite way of asking why don't you have a bedroom furniture?
 And I don't think they liked our folding tables, baby.
 And the truth is it's not because we don't like bedroom furniture, it's that we can't afford the
 bedroom furniture we would like. Now, that is not a sob story that is not lamenting.
 No, right. We could go and buy bedroom furniture.
 I just don't want to buy poorly constructed bedroom furniture because it's what we can afford at the moment because we can afford at the moment.
 I can also afford folding tables and wait.
 But folding tables is an upgrade from upside down cardboard boxes.
 Which is what we originally had.
 And again, I don't say that as a sub story.
 I just say that as there's bigger priorities to spend money on right now.
 Yeah.
 But also, the other night we looked at some furniture and I was like,
 I just don't like any of it.
 Yeah.
 I have, I have champagne tastes on a beer budget, but this is the goodness of the Lord.
 Look around our house and look at all the things the Lord has given us that is
 what we want, but is beyond our pay grade.
 Right.
 I just anyway, that's that's that's a whole other topic.
 But yeah, in terms of making decisions, it's honoring what you do have.
 And you know, watching the Lord fill a gap.
 Right.
 So that's like sort of smaller decisions.
 Right.
 I was also thinking about, you know, bigger decisions.
 So the every time that we've, you know, bought a house or moved house, even moving countries,
 we're really careful about not manipulating the other person into being at our pace or our speed,
 but actually listening to the Holy Spirit together and waiting until you both have peace before you move on anything.
 But even before we talk about the big stuff, I remember there's no word of a lie.
 This is before the iPhone came out.
 So before 2007, I remember just realizing, like, I think Microsoft had just released
 some sort of like pocket handheld wireless thing.
 And, you know, I'm a nerd at heart.
 And so I remember saying, look, babe, I need a new cell phone.
 What do you think about this?
 And again, what I want, I want my own way.
 I don't want to have to run.
 I'll do I just want to spend hundreds of dollars on this and just satisfy my nerd fetish, but we're married
 I you know don't have the luxury of doing that and plus it's not wisdom and so remember saying babe
 What do you think and you've done this a couple times in our marriage row something?
 I really really want and I run it past you and you're like, I don't know, baby. It just doesn't seem like the best
 But I you know, I just don't think that's wise and you know, I appreciate you saying that
 I'm kind of grumbling because I really wanted my like nerd fetish like scratched
 But it doesn't happen a couple months later something revolutionary comes from the corner like the iPhone like can I bummed out be a family
 you get given one right but
 But in terms that your whole point is the whole thing only works if we yield to one another
 You know scripture says submit yourselves one to another everyone loves to quote the live submit to your husband's
 But in the very same passages it is a submit yourself one to another right so I think I think we're quite good
 it's submitting to one another? Yeah. And to your point, the stakes are just bigger when
 they're bigger situations, but we've learned them in smaller things.
 Yeah. Well, I was thinking too, like remember before Abbie was born, you had that invitation
 to go to the Philippines with John and Carol. Yeah, I don't remember.
 And it was a great invitation and wow, what an opportunity. But I just didn't feel good about it
 at all, which... And it was like seven weeks before... Seven weeks before, you know... The baby was due.
 I was, I should be home resting, shouldn't be a big deal at all.
  </li><li>And it was only like seven days.
  </li><li>But just couldn't get any peace on it.
 You know, and just so I just said,
 I don't want you to go, I don't feel good about it.
 So you were like, no problem.
 You know, I'm not gonna go.
 We ended up having the baby while John and Carol
 were in the Philippines, you know?
 We had it that week.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So.
  </li><li>But I also think about moving here,
 or traditionally or historically rather, in our marriage,
 you hear from the Lord, generally speaking before I do.
 Yes.
 Right? So you've had a dream, you hear from the Lord,
 and when you're presenting things, you're never, ever presenting is,
 I've heard from the Lord, so buckle up, buttercups, this is what we're doing.
 Right.
 You've always just said, hey, would you pray about this?
 And usually you haven't told me the strength of the revelation
 about the thing that you're getting.
 Well, not until you've heard something.
 Again, until I've heard something.
 Yeah.
 And I've appreciated it.
 I mean, you knew about that before we even got married.
 Yeah.
 Like the Lord told you on our first date, that's the man who you marry.
 Yeah.
 I didn't know that.
 I didn't know that.
 I went into the bathroom and vomited.
 Right.
 It took me about eight months and I was on again, off again.
 And you just calmly just said, well, Lord, just, you know, he'll just work out.
 And I was like a yo-yo like, I think I want to know.
 I don't, you know, like, you know, you're just happily going.
 I know how it ends.
 I'll just sit this one out.
 Well, I still have my moments of just being like, you know, this is really
 hard. But I never felt manipulated or controlled. Same with moving countries, buying houses
 and all the other things. Well, I didn't tell you even until after we got engaged today about
 what I had journaled with the Lord in that whole thing. To be honest, I think you told me until
 we were as a fullness of it, until we got married because I remember being like, wait, what?
 Well, because I guess I had seen quite a few people do the Lord told me that you are my spouse
 thing. I just thought, I don't want to do that. Even if that's true, the other person has a choice
 and they have to have a choice. Otherwise, later on down the road, when everything goes pear-shaped,
 which you have those seasons, then it becomes, well, I'm blaming the Lord because the Lord told
 my spouse that I had to marry them or whatever. It just becomes dysfunction soup.
 I think it's always wisdom to wait until you're both on the same.
 Well, on that topic, what do we do? And I know the answer to this because I'm married to you.
 But for the sake of our listeners, what do we do when we, one of us feels really strongly
 about something the other person doesn't? What's our agreement?
 We do nothing.
 I know it's sort of infuriating.
 It is.
 We do nothing until there's unity.
 Yeah, we don't move forward until that we have unity.
 And that seems weird. We just keep the status quo until we both heard from the Lord.
 And I think that's been really good. I mean, it's not an enjoyable process at times.
 No, I mean,
 Historically, it's worked out well. Yeah.
 The other night we were looking at cars, you know, our God bless our minivan,
 it's served us so faithfully, but we're just looking out, you know, the next six months a year,
 just thinking, okay, we probably need to think about, you know, replacing the minivan.
 And so we go car shopping and cars are not my thing.
 I, you know, I've driven the same minivan and, you know, it's funny.
 I look at some people with their phones and like, Oh my gosh, how can you use that?
 You're below the poverty line of iPhones.
 You know, they're rocking like an iPhone four.
 And I'm like, Oh my gosh.
 And to them, they're oblivious.
 That's how I feel about cars.
 So when we go shopping for cars, you know, I might chip in some ideas here and there, but there are no.
 To your point, and it's not like you pull rank, but you're like, babe, who does all the driving?
 Right.
 And who has a passion about car?
 Yeah, you do.
 Get, you know, get whatever you want.
 So it's now the time I should tell you that I found a minivan that we can get in a, in a stick shift.
 Oh my gosh.
 It's OK.
 It's a Mercedes.
 We can't get it anyway.
 It doesn't look like a nice van, but just the idea of a stick shift again.
 I'm sure a stick shift would be wasted in a minivan.
 I probably would.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 But yeah, it was quite funny even just walking through with the lovely guy at the Toyota
 dealership, wasn't it?
 Yeah.
 Cause he kept asking you questions and eventually just said, you know, she's the one that's going to
 Yeah, I just said that.
 It's like, I really don't care.
 Talk to my wife.
 She's the one who's interested.
 I'm playing the game on my phone.
 I'm just here for the ride along.
 Yeah.
 It was quite funny.
 Any other thoughts on making decisions?
 Um, trying to think if there's.
 I think we've already mentioned this, but even as a married couple, I still think even though
 you can make, I suppose you could make your decisions in a bubble, but I still think it's
 safer to continue to invite in those people that know you well and have wisdom to help
 you with decisions.
 I tell you what I have learned is if there's a thought in your head of, "I don't want
 to go and share that with that person because they're probably going to say no," that would
 be the very person to go share with. Usually that person is an authority figure. But I
 make it a keen point to include, you know, I used to be my parents, but you know, our
 leaders are pastors and say, this is what we're thinking. What do you think? Because
 they will have a piece. You know, one of my friends, I'm really proud of this person.
 I haven't asked to tell the story. So I'm keeping it anonymous. But he was praying and
 him and his wife were both in agreement and it heard something. And as they began to share
 with their leaders, their leaders are like, that, that, that doesn't feel quite right.
 Like timing wise or, you know, I can't put my finger on why it doesn't feel right.
 And this person was admittedly bummed because they're like, man, we, you know, we feel like
 we've heard from the Lord and, you know, me and my wife and this is like all the stars
 are lining and the only thing that's wrong is none of my leaders are feeling this.
 And as they're praying one day, my friend was like, Oh, I remember, I only know in part
 and I hear in part and I see in part.
 So what if what I'm hearing is right, but it's only a part of it.
 And what my leaders are hearing is also right and they have a part.
 And I was so amazed to watch as my friend just said, I'm actually going to prioritize
 the voice of the leaders in my life in this decision.
 And I was like, that's a very hard thing to do.
 Yeah, it is.
 And you accrue in wisdom when you do that.
 And I think it's going to serve them well.
 Yeah.
 So there you go.
 How many decisions with wisdom and no sorrow?
 There you go.
 Are you ready for a listener's question?
 -Yes. -Well, tough luck, because we don't have one this week.
 Well, we do.
 We have some, but they're going to take longer than I've got headspace to answer for tonight.
 But what I do have is listeners' feedback.
 -Oh, nice. -Remember how we did that survey?
 -Yes. -And remember how our listeners replied?
 -Yes. -Filled out the feedback.
 -Thank you. -So, guys, I have to say, I loved,
 and when I say loved, I mean, loved reading every single piece of feedback.
 I read every single thing.
 I'm not going to share it all with you.
 I'm going to share some of the highlights.
 AJ Jones, are you ready for this?
 I'm ready.
 This is their nerdy section called listeners feedback summary.
 Do you want me to do a little ditty?
 I need a better title for that.
 But I can't think of it, but your ditty was perfect.
 Thank you.
 All right, let's start with geography.
 Yes.
 I'm going to need some more and through that.
 Let's start with geography.
 Geography.
 I love geography.
 77% of you are listening from somewhere in the United States.
 13% of you are somewhere in Great Britain.
 The other 10% you're made up of some fabulous countries called other.
 Wow. Yeah, which would include. Yes.
 In chronological order. Okay.
 Chronological. Well,
 like size. No, no, and like the biggest to like, okay,
 depreciating. Okay. I'm sure.
 I, we need to record earlier tonight because I've lost the power of speech.
 So we've got Australia, Canada, Germany, Norway, Iceland and Japan.
 I was going to try and say hi in all those languages.
 G'day. G'day. What was the next one? Canada. E. Okay. Germany. Hey.
 Guten Tag. Oh, Guten Tag. Norway. I can't remember how to spell.
 Yeah, I ask a die. Let me know. I love you. Iceland.
 They go. And Japan.
 What isn't kenichiwa? Hello in Japan?
 Oh, maybe it's got Demar Gato, Mr. Roberto.
 Oh my god.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>All right, well, it's been two long since we've been
 in Japan, that's the problem.
  </li><li>Wherever you are.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Thank you for listening, thank you for fulfilling
 our feedback.
  </li><li>Thank you so much.
  </li><li>Technology wise, 73% of you are using the built-in
 iPhone app called Podcast, which I don't blame you.
 Nothing wrong with that, it's built into the phone,
 it's fantastic, but here's why it's not ideal
 for our podcast.
 You can't see the chapter markers.
  </li><li>Hello?
  </li><li>Which means you can't skip to your favorite parts
 or skip the parts that you don't like.
 For example, if you're not a survey nerd,
 rather than listening to me list percentages,
 you could just hit skip and go straight to the next section.
  </li><li>But that's what I use.
 I use the purple podcast.
  </li><li>We need to set you up with a different app.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Okay, so. - Which one?
  </li><li>Well, I'll get there in a second.
 73% of you are using that and I understand why.
 6% of you are listening via a web browser,
 which confused me until a bunch of you said,
 the reason we do that is at work,
 we're allowed to have a web browser open
 and stream music, but we can't use our personal devices
 like our iPhone, I was like, that makes so much sense.
  </li><li>Yeah it does.
  </li><li>And then finally about 4% of you
 are using the Overcast app.
 Now, HU say, well, app should I be using?
 Should be using the Overcast app.
  </li><li>Overcast app.
  </li><li>It's my favorite podcast app.
 So one I use, it does support chapters
 so that you can skip around or, you know,
 refind your favorite part of the podcast.
 It's got some other fancy things in it too.
 I'll put a link in the show now, Overcast.
 I will see if this time next year we can move you up from 4%.
 A couple of interesting things.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>This one was astonishing to me.
 I asked, how did you first hear about the podcast?
 50% of you said that you first heard about the podcast
 from a friend.
  </li><li>Oh, wow.
  </li><li>So thank you everybody who's recommended the podcast.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's lovely.
  </li><li>That's a big deal.
 20% of you heard about it via Instagram or Facebook,
 which is really cool because every week we post
 Facebook or Instagram, like the R for this week's episode.
 Yes.
 And I often think, why are we doing this?
 Cause surely if you listen to the podcast, you already know this episode is out.
 Right.
 Cause it just appears in your, your list of podcasts.
 But I just figured 20% is a big deal of the people who listen.
 So if we can keep getting 20% of people, I'll keep posting to Instagram and Facebook.
 But this was an interesting one.
 90% of you listen every single week.
 Wow.
 With a third of that group, third of that 90%,
 describing themselves as complete or finishers,
 in that you have listened to every single episode.
 Like, so you might have just started a couple of weeks ago,
 but you've gone back from the very beginning
 and listened to all of them, God bless you,
 and listened to some episodes more than once.
 I was thrilled to see that for the first time ever,
 our listeners are more active on Instagram than Facebook.
 Historically, Facebook has been the most dominant
 social media platform. And it's recently been overtaken by
 Instagram, which is great.
 Way more time on Instagram and practically zero time on
 Facebook. Me too. One of the most astonishing pieces of
 feedback and almost 100%, not quite. I had three people who
 didn't agree, but almost all of our listeners answered this
 question in a fascinating way. The question was, what do you
 think about us creating a way for listeners to support the
 show financially. I was wondering what people would think because on the one hand, I love
 podcasts. Like I listened to a lot of them. I listened to them when I'm for walk, listened
 to them when I'm in the car on my own. I listened to them while I'm doing housework. I really,
 really enjoy podcasts. But then I started thinking about it. All of the podcasts I listened
 to are ad supported. Yes.
 Now I don't begrudge that because I know that creating podcasts is a time consuming thing.
 And I like that the podcasts I listen to, the people who make those are getting paid,
 but I don't want to have ads on our podcast.
 No.
 Now, I'm not opposed to them.
 I just don't think I have the time to find companies that I'd actually want to give airtime
 to and to try them down within voices and keep track of who's who and make sure that there's
 you know, ad slots filled every week.
 So I hadn't thought about that, but I did think, you know, we do put an awful lot of
 work into podcast. And I know that there are people out there who'd like to give back.
 And I was thrilled to see, like I said, that every single person, well, nearly every single
 person who answered that question, they said, sure, why not? Which was amazing. So spurred
 on by your encouragement, we have created a Patreon account.
 Now, what is this Patreon you ask? Well, Patreon is a website that allows creators like us
 to be supported by fans of our work, people like you.
 Now, before we go any further, let us encourage you that the podcast is always going to be
 available to people to listen to it, whether they want to give anything towards it or not.
 Of course.
 But for those of you who'd like a little more buy in or want to get connected and give back,
 we've actually created a way that you can do that.
 And in return, you'll get a little something as our way of saying things.
 So you head over to Patreon, you decide how much you'd like to give each month and
 Patreon, the website handles all the account creation. They handle, you know,
 debiting your credit card or whatever it is and then passing the money to us each month.
 They handle all of that. So if you like the podcast, if it's something that is encouraged you on a
 regular basis, if it's something that you're like, yeah, I would like to help support that,
 then head on over to allen and AJ.com/support and our website will automatically redirect you to
 our Patreon page and let's just say we have a little surprise announcement for you guys
 over on our Patreon page.
 So that's it.
