<p> Mrs Jones yes it's that time of the week it is indeed it's that time of the night we need a jingle.
 It's coming I didn't you want to announce a jingle competition I did I want to have a jingle contest.
 So we'll have people submit they're keeping up the Jones jingles wait our podcast called keeping up with the Jones is keeping up with the Jones is jingle and then we'll select one and what are they when if we select it.
 I don't know. We could come up with something good though.
 Okay. So guys, completely nebulous prize yet we describe.
 We'll tell you the nebulous prize next week.
 Okay.<br/>
 We'll so start working on it now.<br/>
 When do they have to submit their jingles by?
 October 1st.<br/>
 That's very precise for somebody who's done no planning.
 Well, I just thought that's the first first that's after where we are right now.
 Ok, October 1st, Jingle competition.<br/>
 Our child wrote a whole song today in the car so they can write a jingle.
 Let's talk about that.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Abigail our 8-year-old was in the back of the car while you were driving along.
 Yeah, and I was only driving from Blue Coast to Walmart so it was like a 5-minute drive
 at the most.<br/>
 And she pulls out her notepad and her pen.
 And writes a song.<br/>
 And she has a verse, one, and then she has a chorus.
 Yeah, the chorus kind of happened in the way home from Walmart actually.
 the but it's actually quite good.<br/>
 It's really good.<br/>
 Well, I wouldn't say it's really good.
 I'd say it's quite good.<br/>
 She's eight.<br/>
 OK, so you're saying it's really good for an eight year old.
 I think it's a really I couldn't write something like that in five minutes.
 Are you kidding?<br/>
 Yeah, it starts with straight out a Compton.
 No, no, no, please.<br/>
 I think it's plagiarism from hard living.
 Anyway, welcome to episode 68 of keeping up with the Joneses.
 Welcome.<br/>
 It's very good to have you back last week.
 You were sick.<br/>
 I was, but Josh Parsons did a tremendous job of standing in.
 Yeah, he was very good.<br/>
 And Josh and Sarah currently enjoying the seaside.
 Yeah, she shied.<br/>
 She shiked.<br/>
 It's going to be a long night.<br/>
 Very strong conry of you.<br/>
 This week we had Labor Day, which meant Monday, no M&amp;A.
 And we were off work.<br/>
 We were.<br/>
 It was fantastic.<br/>
 It was good.<br/>
 Good draw school.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 That felt really nice.<br/>
 It's a great catch up with the kids.<br/>
 And then Tuesday we had orientation for our new students.
 So good.<br/>
 From all over the country.<br/>
 Really?<br/>
 And all over the world, really?<br/>
 Well, not all over the world.<br/>
 Well, a couple of different places in the world.
 OK, we've we've drastically shrunk that net.
 Well, if we let me hear you wiggle out of this.
 If we put a pin in England where one is from.
 Yes.<br/>
 And we put a pin in Australia and then a pin in Nashville.
 We'd be covering a large portion of the world.
 Right. So that's how you are describing our catchment. Yeah. Yeah. We have students from a bunch of different states,
 including one of my favorite California, Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina. And as you say, a family from Australia
 flew to come. And our friend Will arrived on Monday as well. And it was just awesome to see all the students, wasn't it?
 It was so awesome. Great, great day. And tomorrow we kick off. So we're really, really excited about that.
 And it's super fun as well to have the year two students there because there are students that you've
 previously fallen in love with. You know, we've, I feel like we've fallen in love with every class and then you have to let them go.
 Right.<br/>
 And the fun part about year two is they're back, which is awesome.
 The most important thing that happened this week was obviously Apple's announcement, which we did.
 Clearly.<br/>
 We did a great job of not. I turned off my phone, didn't watch Twitter, didn't read any RSS feeds,
 and then at night, Wednesday, we came home, put the kids to bed, and then we just watched
 the Apple keynote.<br/>
 I looked at the website during the day.
 I feel she'd done.<br/>
 I'm sorry.<br/>
 I feel filthy.<br/>
 I didn't tell you what I saw.<br/>
 No, but your face was just like...<br/>
 But I couldn't wait.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 Highlights for you?<br/>
 The new phones.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 And the fact that they shoot upgraded video.
 And there's a 128 now.<br/>
 I was being a 128.<br/>
 Oh, I've never had it.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 And what I think is funny is that whenever there's an Apple keynote on, we get text messages
 from people saying, "Hey, can I buy your phones because I know you're upgrading?"
 That's true.<br/>
 People would say.<br/>
 Which happened this year.<br/>
 But I also liked the iPad Pro, except that it seems like it's huge.
 I don't want it.<br/>
 You just want the pencil part.<br/>
 I want the pencil part because of illustrating the book.
 Yes.<br/>
 That's true i you have been using a pencil straight up for the whole thing yeah and it's been a frustrating experience with the pencil that i have.
 Because it doesn't have a really fine tip so i'm guessing at where i'm hitting the iPad.
 Oh we've done a great job even you're guessing thank you and we talked about a be writing a song.
 Let's talk about m j r spiritual giant this is her two old ladies and gentlemen he's so cute he's very cute started last week.
 Yeah. All of a sudden, when I started putting him to bed, he would say, "Daddy, you pray me tongues?"
 Yeah. And so I would just start praying for him in tongues.
 And he would just be enthralled. So every time I put him to bed at night, he now requests, "Daddy,
 you pray me tongues." And I just pray in tongues over him, and it's glorious.
 He was just up a few minutes ago, and I sang to him and then prayed in tongues.
 but when I came in, he said, "I said to Jesus, 'My name is MJ,' and I was like, 'What?'
 And then I was thinking, 'What is he talking about?' But like 20 minutes before I had heard him
 saying, 'I'm MJ,' and then having this whole conversation. So I'm not sure if he's had some sort
 of visitation in his bedroom or... Well, he asked when I got bed at night that he prays,
 and I asked him, 'What...' He wants a prayer for dreams. I said, 'What do you want to dream about?'
 And it's always Jesus and cows right cows and Jesus cows and Jesus they go together
 And then this morning at church in the passage prayer meeting what did MJ do? Oh, it was so cute
 So Tony's like well, I think we should pray and MJ was in the room and he always he likes to pray so he gets excited
 So I just said MJ you want to come over and pray and he said yeah
 So he said am I not with it? Do you want to start?
 And he like threw his head back and his arms back which is what he does anyway shut his eyes and he said
 Jesus<br/>
 more<br/>
 Amen<br/>
 Sure and sweet ladies and young good person
 You know I was thinking this week about what we're gonna speak on the podcast tonight
 And I've been thinking a lot and I must be because all the students are in town and they're about to start this eight-month
 Adventure yes, and I was thinking about
 Talking tonight about times and seasons. I don't know what we're gonna talk about regarding times and seasons
 but that was the phrase that was referring through my head times and seasons.
 Then we went to church this morning and Christu Prey, who was our guest speaker, was speaking
 in part about times and seasons.<br/>
 I thought, "Gosh, it's interesting."<br/>
 So let's jump straight into there.<br/>
 Let's talk about seasons of our life, good seasons, bad seasons.
 What have we learned?<br/>
 AJ Jones, over to you.<br/>
 What have we learned?<br/>
 Well, I think something was probably encouraging if you're in a difficult season is that they're
 temporal.<br/>
 You know, they're not forever unless, of course, you want to partner with them being
 forever.<br/>
 And how does one partner with the season for being forever?
 What are some of the signs that you're overdue for a season change?
 I think when it feels like you're spinning your wheels and you're just having more and
 more of the same experiences without there being any kind of resolution or result towards
 the positive.<br/>
 So, I think sometimes, you know, we'll meet with somebody for coffee that seems, it seems
 to me in listening to their story that they're experiencing the same story over and over
 again, but they're not arriving at the conclusion that they're the one thing that's similar
 between all of those situations and maybe God's trying to get something through to them
 so that he can move them on to the next thing.
 And that's when you get to ask innocently, I wonder if there's a common denominator between
 all the stories you're telling me.<br/>
 Oh, oh, look, it's, it's you.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 Wait.<br/>
 That's never a nice revelation to have, is it?
 No.<br/>
 I think, yeah, I think like in times in my life where I've partnered with either feeling
 sorry for myself or probably mostly that feeling sorry for myself, it keeps you in a place
 of partnering with being a victim and it seems like that cycle never ends until you start
 to agree with God and, you know, stop thinking only about yourself.
 Mm hmm.<br/>
 Does that make sense?<br/>
 It does make sense.<br/>
 I was listening to Graham Cook the last week or so, and he is a fantastic
 teaching called the art of thinking brilliantly, which I don't recommend
 listening to while you're trying to run or walk because you'll have to stop
 and take notes every couple of steps.<br/>
 I gave up.<br/>
 I can't listen to him at all when I'm walking or running because I just
 I'm like, I'll never remember that.<br/>
 So when we're talking about seasons of difficulty or negative seasons, which we're going to talk
 about positive seasons in a second, I was challenged because he said this, what if frustration
 has a heavenly counterpart? What if frustration is designed to keep you from walking into a situation
 that God doesn't want you in? What if frustration is the precursor to favor? What if it's God's way
 of telling you that an upgrade is available. Frustration is a confession that we are powerless,
 and that's not heavenly thinking. The power of the heavenly minded is that our hearts
 and minds are always focused on who God is for us. I'm just thinking, sometimes when
 you're in seasons that don't seem to be moving on quite as quickly as you'd like, probably
 a great question to be asking is, "God, do you have something for me in this season?
 am I in a danger of missing it because I'm so desperate to move on to the next?
 Right.<br/>
 Because I've noticed that God's lessons have a way of following you.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And sometimes I've noticed in my own life, for example, I've tried to escape one season
 only to find myself moving, perhaps geographically and finding the same thing God trying to teach
 me in this new place.<br/>
 I used to at the end of every year read through my journal from that year and kind of summarize
 the major themes and just kind of review the year with the Lord, Lord, what, let's see
 if I learned what you were trying to show me, what were some of the themes. And then I'd always ask
 for like a clue or a prophetic word for the coming year, like Lord, what's going on in this
 season, what are the things you have for me? Because in Ecclesiastes it says this, it says this,
 a time for everything and a season for every activity under the heavens. So I'm always
 asking the Lord, Lord, what season am I in? I remember meeting with a friend, somebody I
 greatly respect. And we met for coffee and I paid for his coffee at the end. And he thought
 me for it initially. He did the good British thing. I'll get this. No, no, I'll get this. And he
 said to me, Oh, actually, no, I'm going to let you get this. And he said, God's got me in the season
 of learning to receive. And I said, Oh, he said, yeah, I just I've been such a mindset of always
 thinking I need to give that God's actually no, I'm taking you into the season. And I just thought,
 gosh, that would be really weird to enter into a season of receiving without getting
 your heads up on that.<br/>
 And you were always giving away the very thing that God is trying to give you.
 Does that make sense?<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 So yeah, I loved that Lord.<br/>
 What season am I in to kind of help me understand and accelerate my partnership with God of
 what he's trying to achieve?<br/>
 I remember, again, this is a number of years ago, like 10 or 15 years ago, but at one
 point, you know, I was reading the story of Joseph a lot and just really interested by
 his incredible attitude, regardless of the circumstances or regardless of the season
 that he was in, his focus remained on God. And, you know, otherwise he probably wouldn't
 have had the results that he had. But I remember during that time saying, Lord, where am I
 in the story of Joseph? Like, you know, am I still in the pit?
 Am I pot of first household yet? Am I in a place where I can serve to the best of my abilities?
 And even though it doesn't look like the level of freedom I'd like, well, I, you know, I could still experience favor
 and you're still moving me forward. Are there things you want me to learn in this place that I can only learn here?
 Um, this is going to help me in the next place that kind of stuff. And so for a number of years, the Lord, you know,
 every once in a while would be like, "Hey, you're here in the story. Hey, you're here in the story."
 And I remember in 2001, like at the beginning of 2001, when the Lord started speaking to me about
 going into full-time ministry and all that kind of stuff, and I was like, "Oh, I don't know. I don't
 know if I'm ready." And the Lord was showing me like, "You're at the stage where you're
 interpreting the dreams. Like you're getting ready to be released into something." And
 And it's just as important to partner with me now in this season and keeping a good attitude
 while I open the door.<br/>
 I guess it's just a funny way that God and I would mark the seasons over a number of
 years through the story of Joseph.<br/>
 I thought Chris DuPray did something very interesting as one as a sermon illustration.
 I didn't know he was going to do this, but he asked me to stand up in front of the whole
 church.<br/>
 So I stood up in front of the whole church.
 He said, you know, turn and face me.<br/>
 So I was now sideways to the church.<br/>
 And he said, put out your hand.<br/>
 So I put out my hand, palm up.<br/>
 And he put his palm next to my palm and kind of applied pressure.
 And without thinking about it, I just applied pressure back and push back on him.
 Like you're pushing against a wall.<br/>
 Like I was pushing against his hand and he was pushing against mine.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And he said to me, why did you push my hand?
 And I, you know, I would pause.<br/>
 He said, I don't tell you to push my hand.
 And he said, we're like that with God.
 You know, God comes to bring something new and often the first thing we'll do is is produce resistance and I was like, oh my gosh, that's amazing.
 It was great.<br/>
 It was a really powerful illustration.
 I'm not sure if it translates too well without you seeing it, but I was thinking about that verse that talks about, you know, we're being changed from glory to glory.
 Often when God's moving us into a new season, either because of fear or stubbornness or we love the season, we're in so much.
 we forget sight of the fact that he's bringing us from one level of glory to another.
 I kind of am really envious, and am I allowed to say that in one sense, of the students,
 you know, marking this new season of their life, their tomorrow begins eight months.
 And I was just praying about that yesterday saying, Lord, I'm so excited for the students.
 I'm so excited to be a part of watching this season of change coming for them.
 Sometimes I think there's a danger that we think that seasons of change
 are purely sovereign in nature.<br/>
 Like, oh my gosh, it was God, you know, I wish I was on the school,
 or I wish I could do this, or I wish I could do that.
 Not realizing that we can step into a new season with God anytime we want.
 Right.<br/>
 Really powerful verse in James.<br/>
 So James 4, "drawn ear to God, and he'll draw near you."
 And either a long time ago that that means I can actually initiate
 a new season of intimacy with God anytime I want, just by choosing to draw near.
 gonna talk about something i don't really talk about.
 Sure fasting.<br/>
 Is it that you like talking about or you like doing it i don't like talking about it in case it somehow weeks got up and he's like yeah that's a great year when you fast.
 But fasting brings an element of focus that helps you understand the season you're in like there would be times when the holy spirit would bring along.
 a season of fasting i was hate that part of the because i love food.
 But it was designed to help me focus you never fast for god's sake.
 You know the reason you fast isn't to earn anything but really to focus and helps you see things you might not otherwise see because you're too busy stuffing your face with to read us.
 Yeah, another thing i really liked that christie prays at this morning he was talking about second timothy.
 Where is this be prepared in season and out of season correct review can encourage with great patience and careful instruction.
 And he was like we all have been in season but there's also being out of season and he quipped being out of season is still a season right.
 And I was like, oh, yeah.<br/>
 Sometimes, like, we all love the season
 that we feel like we're in where everything's going swimmingly
 and let's just favor this, that, the next thing.
 And then sometimes it feels like, oh, where is that?
 You're like, wait, no, no, you still,<br/>
 God's still teaching you something<br/>
 no matter what season you think you're in.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah, even if your season feels like
 you're pushing water uphill with a rake,
 it's still a season.
  </li><li>And that's the season where great patience is required.
  </li><li>Yeah. - And careful instruction.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You know, that's usually where the pruning happens.
 the correction, the rebuking, the encouraging,
 and just being faithful in that.
 So that begs the question then babe,
 what seasons do you think we're in?
  </li><li>I think we're just in a season of steady building,
 probably not building at the rate I'd like to build at.
  </li><li>I'd like to go much faster.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'd like to be doing skyscrapers
 and I'm doing ranch style houses or something.
 You know, it's not, but I think we're just in a steady
 season of sowing into others and building.
 I'm all excited.
 I've been reading a lot of books.
 I think I've mentioned this in the podcast by Harold Eberle.
 I'd never read any of this stuff before.
 And I just think in studying the church
 for the messages I've been preaching
 in the last couple of weeks,
 I've got really excited about the role of the church.
 And I've got really excited about my role in the church.
 And I--
  </li><li>Your role as the prophetic dancer?
  </li><li>Yes, hold the like,
 I bring forth my flag and I will now perform.
 You know, we keep joking about prophetic dance, but I think that we're going to see a restoration.
 I'm so excited. There's a bunch of people in our church who are so gifted at dance.
 And when I see them dance, something feels absolutely right. I tell you also,
 when we're in worship and it feels like someone should be dancing, and I'm looking around,
 and nobody's dancing, I'm just like,
 oh, I just would love to see somebody dance.
 And I think secretly I want to be a perfect dancer
 in all seriousness.
  </li><li>Well, we could get you some like her baby.
  </li><li>I don't need to wear like her.
 I'm just gonna bust a move.
  </li><li>I mean, it's funny to say,
 but there's been a couple times where I have
 felt something shift on a Sunday morning
 and it's been right at that moment where I've turned
 and I've seen one of the amazing dancers just start dancing.
 And it's like a can opener in the spirit.
 Like all of a sudden, we've just gone someplace completely
 different because one person has just gotten completely abandoned.
 Yeah, I love it.
 I think it would be good to pray for all the people who in different seasons.
 Yeah.
 I feel like for many people, you're stepping into a season of
 unrestrained optimism.
  </li><li>Good.
  </li><li>Like I think what's happening is God is moving on our hearts
 to really think differently.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And to be gripped with a relentless optimism
 about who he is first in this situation.
 I think he's so good.
 Sometimes, you know, he brings us into seasons
 to kind of show off.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And sometimes before he's shown off, it's kind of scary
 'cause you're like, why am I here?
 and you're simply here to witness the majesty of God in your life.
 And I think for many people who are listening,
 that you may find yourself in a situation with what seems insurmountable odds,
 overwhelming reasons why you should quit.
 And I think if you were to quit,
 you might be missing one of the greatest displays of God's affection for you.
 So my encouragement to anybody who is wrestling with quitting,
 Just stand firm, watch the awesome work of God on your behalf and you're going to have
 a story and a test of me that shifts stuff for you.
 Well, what was the verse we looked at this morning about?
 You know, you'll get there if you don't quit.
 I don't know, but it sounds like a Chinese proverb rather than the Bible verse.
 It's true, but it really was the Bible verse.
 You who doesn't quit gets there in the end.
 Second hesitations 480.
 That was something like that.
 And I think for the people who are in an exciting season of their life, there's a danger that
 we're worried that this is too good to be true.
 And I think this is a season for you to find great delight in the season that you're in,
 let rich relationships, you know, bubble to the surface.
 I, you know, I honestly, I feel like this fall is an amazing shift for the body of Christ.
 I really do.
 amazing shift into understanding more of the goodness of God. I think this is probably
 the season where many dreams are going to be fueled. I feel like finances are being released
 to accomplish that which you've only dreamed about. And I think, you know, Sarah Parsons
 started something on last Tuesday, hashtag promote your peers. And I thought, what a
 great idea. I think that we're moving rapidly to a situation where we genuinely delight in
 the success of others. Because we understand that other people's success doesn't come at
 the expense of ours. So I have no idea what season you're in. I hope this rambling thoughts
 about times and seasons of a huge encouragement to you. If you're in a sucky situation, just
 remember that seasons by their very nature are temporal. And so they do change. If you're
 on awesome season, just enjoy it and may all your Christmases be.
 That's right.
 And may all your relationships be blessed, may your family life be flourishing, and may
 you see exceptional things that you never thought were possible.
 Yeah, Father, ask that you would, for each listener God, that you would bless them right
 where they're at.
 Father, if there's specific things to learn in this season, to get to the next season
 Lord that you would put us back on track to learn the things that you have us in this season for.
 And help us not to enter into and partner with frustration or self-fity or any of those kind of
 things that tend to keep us stuck, but to just hold your hand and know you're good and
 head into each day expecting to meet with you.
 All right. If you would like shown us for this week's episode, go to Alan and the AJ.com/68.
