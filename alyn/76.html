<p> I'll live in AJ's podcast for your Monday
 Most wonderful show is<br/>
 Keeping up with the Joneses<br/>
 Hi<br/>
 Welcome to episode 76 of Keeping Up With The Joneses
 Hello<br/>
 You look really cute<br/>
 Thanks<br/>
 (Laughing)<br/>
 You're going to be really fun<br/>
 (Sigh)<br/>
 I was wondering if there was anything attractive about me
 Yes, your voice<br/>
 What's the most attractive thing about my body?
 I can't think of anything else to say.
 Okay.<br/>
 And we're back.<br/>
 And we're back, ladies and gentlemen.<br/>
 Little fun with helium courtesy of Michael Jones birthday party.
 We had a three year old birthday party.
 Do you want to start there?<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 So we had 14 superheroes here.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Explain that you had a superhero themed birthday party.
 We did.<br/>
 He wanted a superhero themed birthday party.
 And all the kids showed up in superhero costumes.
 Yes.<br/>
 And then we had adults come and place evil villains.
 Yes, we had two American villains and one British villain.
 The British do make the most excellent villains.
 Yes.<br/>
 And they look very dapper because apparently you have to wear a sports jacket and a bow tie.
 Yes.<br/>
 And then our children attacked them with silly string.
 Yes, which was a stroke of genius on your bath.
 Thank you.<br/>
 Do you want to talk about the Spider-Man candy apples?
 Yes.<br/>
 We made on Friday, we made 16 Spider-Man candy apples.
 myself and my friend Molly.<br/>
 And...<br/>
 And they were beautiful.<br/>
 They were...<br/>
 They were...<br/>
 ...etrically designed.<br/>
 Amazing.<br/>
 First you have to candy the apples and then you painstakingly decorated with black icing
 the web of Spider-Man's face and then you cut out marshmallow eyes and stuck them to them.
 I mean they were amazing.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 You spent hours.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And then we went on to make other things and then I went to go and speak to a group of
 of ladies and I got home at like 10 o'clock at night and just went to check on them and
 all of the candy apple and icing had slid off them onto the sheet because of humanity.
 We should have put them in the fridge. We probably shouldn't have done them when it
 was raining apparently. Okay. I've never done them before but.
 But then the superhero Molly. Yes. Went and created more that night. She went and got
 all the stuff at like midnight to make them again the next day and then showed up at our
 house at seven in the morning to pick up all the rest of the supplies.
 She totally saved the day. She did. She made a three-year-old boys' birthday party a huge
 success. She really did. And they were really good candy apples. They are. Yeah. I have eaten
 about seven of them. You have not. We didn't have them to eat. I've eaten all the ones I could find.
 Oh dear.<br/>
 Oh, they're delicious.<br/>
 Mm-hmm.<br/>
 So we talked about a lot of stuff this week.
 Yeah, we did.<br/>
 I taught in women and ministry.<br/>
 You did.<br/>
 And it was amazing.<br/>
 Say that again, but louder.<br/>
 It was so good.<br/>
 [laughs]<br/>
 It's a favorite topic of mine.<br/>
 Mm-hmm.<br/>
 You did such a great job, too, of unpacking it and explaining where people get their
 ideas from and how that's actually not what the passages are saying.
 Well, I was helped greatly by an excellent book called Why Not Women.
 Yes, and we're in Cunningham.<br/>
 And somebody else.<br/>
 Must be terrible to be the second author
 'cause you can never remember the name.
 We'll put LinkedIn in the show notes,<br/>
 but in the excellent book,<br/>
 if you're a lot of people are saying,<br/>
 can I get copies of the teaching?<br/>
 But the recordings that we made didn't turn out very well
 for a number of reasons.<br/>
 But actually, if you just go buy that book,
 it's very, very helpful.<br/>
 A lot of the revelation I was teaching from
 was found in that book.<br/>
 It's an excellent book.<br/>
 I highly recommend it.<br/>
 Cool.<br/>
 And then what do we do Thursday night, baby?
 Well, Thursday night,<br/>
 we had a married couples sex talk<br/>
 the School of Ministry students.<br/>
 That sounds fascinating.<br/>
 So, what's a married couple sex talk?<br/>
 Well, there's a brilliant author, Dr. Kevin Lehman, and he said that the quality of sex
 that you're having is actually a reflection of the quality of marriage that you have.
 And I thought it's interesting that God invented both marriage and sex.
 And generally speaking, the church doesn't speak on either topic.
 So there's people out there quite possibly having terrible sex.
 And yet nobody is going to speak to them about it.
 Right.<br/>
 And nobody talks about it, especially in the church.
 I mean, it's like taboo.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 So your sources of income, your sources of input on sex are usually going to come from
 fairly unwholesome sources.<br/>
 So we decided to put on a non-defiling sex talk, which actually started from on our school,
 we teach on sexual sin.<br/>
 And some of the feedback we got from Mary couples was, hey, teaching on sexual sin is
 awesome, but what about those of us who are married and can have sex, but I've got legitimate
 questions. Where can we get answers for that? So we occasionally do these random evenings.
 So there's no doubt about it. It is really awkward to get a group of people together and just have
 somebody talk about sex. But honestly, I forget that it's awkward once I've started talking about it.
 I think what encourages me is we have had this talk twice in the last five years.
 Yeah. And after the last time that we had the talk, there was lots of great feedback from people
 that were just saying, "Wow, this changed a lot of stuff for us and things." So I'm looking forward
 to hearing about how it's helped. Let's stop talking about sex and talk about one of our other
 favorite topics. Okay. This week, I want to talk about life languages. Okay.
 So life languages is one of those things that until you've done it, you don't quite understand
 why everybody's excited about it.<br/>
 And then once you do your life language profile, you then become the person that's talking
 about it all the time and other people don't understand it.
 So in a nutshell, life language is pretty much a communication, a personality profile.
 It's way more than that, but that's the easiest way to describe what it is.
 You were trained in the, what's the one that all the businesses do?
 Myers breaks.<br/>
 So you were a Myers break trained person and you would do that for your old job.
 Yeah, I tested management and then reassigned management teams based on strengths and weaknesses
 from using Myers breaks.<br/>
 So lots of people would know Myers breaks.
 They would know all about that.<br/>
 In your opinion, Myers break versus life languages.
 Life languages is way, way better.<br/>
 Way, way better.<br/>
 It's also Holy Spirit inspired.<br/>
 And it's way more comprehensive.<br/>
 You know, with Miresprays, there's just a few boxes you can be put in.
 With life languages, you're not really put in a box at all.
 No.<br/>
 So, life languages, basically, the way you take a life language profile is you go online,
 you fill out, you know, you have to see those equations.
 It takes about 15 minutes, 15 to 20 minutes.
 And after that, you are sent a report that is basically like having the most accurate
 prophetic word or most accurate word of knowledge about you.
 It describes a bunch of things about you.
 One of the things it gives you is a fluency rating in seven different languages, which
 will come to in a second.<br/>
 The premise being that every single person can speak seven different communication languages
 to degrees of fluency.<br/>
 You can all speak them, but we're more dominant in some of the languages than in others.
 That's very, very helpful.<br/>
 But it also gives you so much more than that.
 In the report that you get, it will tell you your learning style.
 It will tell you your intrusion level, like how well do you do with people interrupting
 what you're doing?<br/>
 It will tell you things like your susceptibility to stress and how to help with those things.
 Here's a couple of things.<br/>
 tell you is your acceptance level, which is basically how you tend to view yourself, whether
 you more easily see your strengths and positive attributes, or whether you tend to focus on
 your weaknesses or negative qualities. What do you think they said about me?
 I think they said you probably focus on your strengths and you have a positive outlook
 about yourself.<br/>
 I scored 98 on that. It said a high acceptance level indicates that you are comfortable in
 the way you see and accept yourself. You tend to focus more on your positive attributes,
 recalling your successes and strengths. Negative input about yourself by others probably will not
 bother you too greatly or for too long and your acceptance will generally not be shaken.
</p><ul>
  <li>Check.
  </li><li>How do you even know that? That's unbelievable.
 You're... Is the other one... You know how people either say I'm an extrovert or an introvert?
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Well, this is kind of a little broader than just those two buckets.
 So they have this thing called your interactive style.
 And from that, they'll tell you whether you tend to be more extraverted, whether you tend to be more introverted, but will also kind of describe some of your key traits.
 This is what they said about me.
 It seems this makes sense.
 This scale indicates how comfortable you are with people most of the time.
 Constantly being around a lot of people, especially those you do not know well, can be exhausting and you may withdraw to prevent stress.
 Yes, you may. That was me at my three-year-old son's birthday party. I was like, "And I'm done.
 There's way too many little children here." Yes.
 So it's super helpful. You get this profile back. And I think the most helpful thing about it is
 it helps you understand you. Yeah. Like for the first time you read it and you're like,
 "Oh, I totally make sense." And it's super validating. What I love about it is this huge emphasis that
 that there are not better languages and worse or languages.
 Does it just say worse, sir?
  </li><li>Worse, sir.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Is that in your profile that you make up words?
 (laughs)
  </li><li>You know what?
 It's a gift.
  </li><li>Except it.
  </li><li>But no, there's a real positive outlook
 that, hey, there's not a better profile
 than a worse profile.
 There's not better languages than other languages.
 It's just, hey, this is how you are,
 and this is how you can improve in your communication.
 These are things you could do
 that would actually help you in your communication style.
 So that's the first thing it does.
 But then it gives you a map really
 to help you understand other people's communication styles.
  </li><li>And when those communication styles are in distress,
 I find that so helpful to be able to identify,
 oh, that's actually what I'm looking for
 in your personality type to be a sign of distress.
 So I can go, oh, hey, how can I help you?
 How can I help?
 Yeah.
  </li><li>You can go online and fill in a profile
 and you get a report
 really really helpful. What's even more helpful than that is attending a seminar where they explain
 a lot of the languages. And I remember one day sitting there and they were going through a language
 that was my lowest language, the language I was least fluent, least familiar with. And I realized
 that all the people I clashed with, it wasn't that they were bad people, revelation. It was just that
 they weren't wired the same way I was. And so I began to understand and have grace for them and
 and not think, you know, it's amazing that when we don't understand people, we judge people,
 and then we write off people, at least that's what I was doing.
 So having this tool has been so helpful.
 So first of all, it helps you understand you.
 Second of all, it helps you understand others and it's super helpful.
 So there are seven languages, AJ Jones.
 Can you name them?
 I think I can.
 there is shaper, contemplator, doer, influencer, responder, mover, and producer.
 I was going to say shaker if I couldn't think of one.
 Mover and shaker.
 So, again, everybody can speak every language, but some languages require more intentionality
 than others depending on how you're wired, depending on how you're built.
 And also, depending on your job, your season of life, you tend to move around in the flu
 and say, depending on what's demanded of you.
 And the great thing is you can teach yourself to speak any of them.
 So traditionally, in the last couple of years, spent a lot of intentional effort being more
 fluent in the languages I'm less fluent in.
 So realizing, actually, this is a real weakness in my communication style.
 I'm going to try and pay more attention.
 I've deliberately surrounded myself by people who are perhaps more fluent in the languages
 that I'm least fluent in and asking them questions, trying to understand, trying to
 pull up those lower languages and practice speaking those.
 And like anything, it feels weird doing something that's not natural to you.
 And I'm encouraged because the more comfortable you become in understanding and practicing
 speaking all the seven languages, the better communicator you can become.
 I think what I like about it too is you can, one of the things we've done is staffed for
 our weaknesses.
 Right.
 So we've intentionally looked in and our personalities are very, very similar, which
 helps us a lot in understanding each other.
 But it also means we're going to have almost exactly the same weaknesses.
 So we're going to have the same blind spots.
 Right.
 So it's helpful for us because we, on our staff, we have responders, we have movers, we have
 the things that we're low in so that we can say, hey, we're thinking about communicating
 this thing that way and sort of check in with all the different types of communications
 and hear from, say, Sarah Paper from Shannon, oh, I don't know.
 I wouldn't say it that way.
 This might be, you know, me as a responder, I would hear so we can temper things that
 we might put more bluntly because we're high shapers.
 Or at least a year, a couple of years, I would run every email I was going to send that could
 potentially be sensitive.
 Past our assistant at the time who's very fluent in their responder language would run
 it past her and just say, could you tell me how would you experience this email?
 How could I write it better?
 You just kind of rammed out again the areas of weakness.
 So that doesn't help you at all if you don't know any of the makeup of those languages.
 So every language of those seven languages that we talked about, there's not a better
 language and a poorer language.
 They're all brilliant languages.
 But each language has got unique characteristics.
 Every language has a filter, needs, passions, and key character strengths.
 So a filter is something that colors incoming or outgoing communication.
 It's the bias through which you view life.
 The need is simply when you're dominant in this language, what is your need from the
 people around you?
 The passions are, what's the primary drive?
 What's the spark that makes life worth living?
 When you're dominant in different languages, you'll have different passions.
 And then lastly, while our languages have their pros and cons, what is the unique character
 strength, the outstanding strength that's unique to that language?
 So I thought it would be fun to go through the top three languages that we have.
 I don't want to go through all seven that would take forever.
 Right.
 But out of interest, our seven languages are almost identical, aren't they, babe?
 They're very, very close.
 What are we?
 What's our language profile?
 Shaper, Contemplator, Doer, Influencer, Responder, Mover, Producer.
 All right.
 And mine, from most fluent to least fluent, is Shaper, Contemplator, Doer, Producer, Mover, Influencer, and Responder.
 Now again, to be able to listen to this, you're like, I'm a clue what that means.
 What does that mean?
 So I thought I'd take our top three, because they're all the same, shape or contemplate
 or doer.
 Yeah.
 And speak about the unique traits of those three languages.
 Okay.
 People who are very fluent in the shape or language tend to be very organized.
 They tend to be visionary people, very focused.
 They're very good at delegating.
 They're quite strategic and intentional.
 They're basically natural leaders.
 So I said this in our profile, I said, "High shapers have the ability to plan, organize
 and lead many activities simultaneously.
 High shapers have the ability to think and plan for both the long and short term.
 It's not unusual for high shapers to have well thought out, 5, 10 or even 20 year goals.
 High shapers like to organize their lives using charts and timelines.
 My shapers are visionary with the ability to see the necessary steps of action that
 are required to complete the goal.
 I think the basic summary of a shaper is shapers love plans.
 We feel most comfortable when there is a plan or if there isn't a plan knowing that
 a plan is being formulated.
 Yes, as long as there is a plan we're happy.
 So remember we were talking about the different traits of that language.
 the filter, the thing that's constantly evaluating all incoming and outgoing information is what?
 Do you have a plan?
 Right.
 So for us, it's just absolutely natural that when we're meeting with people to think in
 terms of plans, when people are in distress, we automatically come up with plans for them.
 Yes, but sometimes what they don't need from us is a plan.
 No, sometimes what they need is just to be heard.
 Right.
 And so we have had to learn to bring up our weaker languages, which actually don't meet
 people with a plan, but meet people with care. Yes. And then if they want help with the plan
 afterwards, that's fine. But the truth is, even when we're caring, we're still formulating a plan.
 Yes. Because that's the gift of a shaper language. The needs, if you're very dominant in the
 shaper language, what you need from other people is support and agreement. Now, at first, that could
 sound like you just want a bunch of yes people, but that's not true. You want people who genuinely
 have bought into the vision, who've bought into the plan. You want people who are happy to
 lend support, who are in agreement with where you're going. And it's fairly common to find
 shapers in leadership positions. And leadership positions can often be difficult positions because
 you're leading people. Right. Yes, by definition. And by definition, a lot of people don't want to
 to be led. So having agreement and support is often very, very welcome. The major passion
 of a shaper, darling? The major passion of a shaper is to lead.
 And the character strength. Patience.
 Well is it patience for people? No, it's patience for the plan to come together. Right,
 and that's the deal. Shapers are very, very, basically it's all about the plan. Yes. Life
 We've been all about the plan.
 Do you want to talk about the conflict we had early on in our marriage?
 Oh, it was so funny.
 Well, it wasn't funny, too.
 Well, it's funny looking back on it now.
 So typically we would wake up on a Saturday morning and, you know, if you weren't traveling,
 I would have a plan in my head and you would have a plan in your head.
 And that's all fine and dandy except that we didn't usually communicate what each of
 our plans were.
 We just each assumed that our plan was the best plan and so we set forth as if our plan
 was what was going to happen that day.
 And then we would end up aggravated with one another when the other person was not coming
 alongside our perfectly laid out plans.
 Our perfectly laid out plans that we hadn't communicated.
 But we had not communicated, yes.
 And then a character trait of a shaper in distress is when the plan is not working, they
 we often move to control to make the plan work.
 So we'd be frustrated that why you support my plan,
 not really neither of us that communicated the plan.
 So the major source of conflict for the first year
 of our marriage till we did our life language
 profiles together was like, oh, we're both leaders
 with a plan that we have involved to communicate
 together a person.
 And our goals are being blocked.
  </li><li>Yeah, so we started waking up on Saturday morning
 and saying, is there anything that you would like
 to make sure happens today?
  </li><li>And even to this day.
  </li><li>Don't do that.
  </li><li>When the alarm goes off, we roll over and we go,
 what is the plan for today?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And on a Monday we go, what's the plan for this week?
 And we just talk about the plan
 and it just brings an incredible sense of peace.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>If you're thinking, oh, that sounds amazing.
 There's a good chance that you're probably
 floon in the shaper language.
 If you're thinking, dear God,
 that sounds like a terrible way to live.
 It might be that you're dominant in some of the other.
 (both laughing)
  </li><li>More spontaneous languages.
 Yes, and that's completely fine.
 Yes.
 The second language that we are fluent in.
 Both of us are fluent in the contemplator.
 Now the contemplator language, how would you describe contemplators?
 Well, contemplators tend to grow facial hair and not me, but most
 contemplators.
 We have a theory that if you see a man with a beard, he's probably a
 contemplator, but now beards are so in that I don't think the theory is working anymore.
 They have a beard, probably a hipster. Contemplators like to think and then think some more and then
 think about what they thought about and then think about whether what they thought about was
 the thing that they were actually thinking about. And it's like, you're being quite facetious
 about counterplayers. I am one. I'm allowed to be for a lot, but counterplayers tend to be
 inquisitive, they love to learn. They're very reflective, quite sensitive. There's a peacefulness
 to them. They tend to be quite complex and brilliant thinkers.
 Yeah, and quiet.
 Common players tend to make brilliant teachers because they're very, very well researched and
 they like to know things.
 Yeah, when they do start talking, they have really thought through what they're saying,
 so it's not going to be a haphazard.
 In the second year school, we have a table of students who are all quite fluent in the contemplative language.
 And so often I'll ask a question and you can just see them go.
 Yeah, you need to think about that.
 Can you come back to me?
 I mean, while we have another table of students who are probably more fluent in the influencer language.
 Or the mover language.
 And they're just already shouted at the answer.
 They're just like, oh, I know the answer.
 So again, funny watching that spectrum.
 It certainly is.
 So the filter of the contemplator, the filter of the contemplator is, am I really interested in this?
 What I love about that is that's not a question they ask. It's something they're just constantly
 thinking. They're thinking, am I interested in this conversation? Am I interested in what
 you're telling me? Am I interested in what I'm reading? Am I interested in what I'm watching?
 Am I interested in this podcast? They don't have to try hard. They're just constantly
 evaluating information that's coming in.
 Yes.
 And for me, unless there's a person involved, I'll just stop being interested if I'm not.
 Does that make sense?
 For me, it doesn't matter if there's a person involved or not.
 I've had to train myself.
 But that's what I mean.
 I choose to stay interested if there's a person sitting in front of me telling me something.
 Right.
 Once I learned this, I started coaching myself saying, "I am interested in this.
 I'm interested in this."
 So if I'm with somebody and I'm not interested, perhaps they're telling a story that takes
 way too long and I've already got the point of the story. I coach myself, smile, nod, stay engaged.
 Maitin, I contact. Because I'm realizing they're speaking a completely different life language
 and actually it's rude for me just to say I'm not interested in this, which is what I used to do.
 Like even yesterday. Sometimes when you're tired, baby, I still am like,
 "Hey, baby, can I tell you I'm not interested?"
 "Oh, okay, thank you.
 I'll just find my heart.
 It's somewhere underneath the tires of the car."
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Okay, maybe that's true.
 Maybe I still have to work hard on that.
  </li><li>What's the need of the contemplating?
  </li><li>The need of a contemplating is personal space.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>That's not what their need is.
  </li><li>It is. - That's true, yeah.
  </li><li>And undefided attention.
  </li><li>Yeah, so when you are meeting with somebody
 who's fluent in the contemplator language,
 don't be picking up your cell phone
 watching the TVs over their heads or whatever.
 No, exactly.
 For people I know who've done perhaps a profile and they've communicated to me, they're floon
 in the common player language.
 I'm having to remind myself, don't look at your Apple watch, don't look at your Apple
 phone, don't do a thing, just kind of maintain eye contact.
 And then also trying to evaluate from their body language, are they interested in the topic
 of discussion?
 Just trying to honor their life language.
 How about the passion?
 The passion is to know.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>So they're gonna collect an enormous amount of information
 and know things about, you know,
 things and have thought them through.
  </li><li>And find genuine pleasure in it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>As somebody who is a high contemplator,
 I take great delight in the acceleration
 that's involved in amassing new information.
 I get bored by the plateau of having learned information.
 So I think that's why we like lots of new things.
 We need to grow.
 Yeah, lifelong learners.
 And then lastly, the strength of a contemplator is they're very loyal.
 Yeah.
 I think they've probably thought through their friendships very carefully.
 That's good.
 I never thought of that.
 So once they've acquired a friend having thought them through carefully, they want to keep
 them.
 The language I'm ranked third in fluency is the language that three years ago I was ranked first in fluency.
 Right.
 And I think probably the reason for that is the change in our responsibilities at work.
 Yes.
 So the third language that we're both joint fluent in is the doer language.
 Yep.
 The person who is fluent in the doer language gets stuff done.
 Yes, we want to check off boxes.
 yeah we love our list we love our to do list we love the satisfaction of scoring something out of the list say list again daddy.
 They're filter is are you doing your share that's the way they view life yeah so whenever they're doing they're just looking around are you doing share.
 Are you doing what needs to be done can you me and they're not trying to be gentle what are you doing the natural filter.
 A person who's been wounded and is dominant in a doer language tends to have the ungodly belief that if you want something done just do yourself.
 Yes, like nobody can do it as good as I can.
 Yeah, and there actually might be some truth to that which is probably why they believe it.
 Because the doers going to finish what they start.
 Oh, the goal is to finish.
 Yes.
 Well, but I do if you get in the way of a doer, you can't not have your list finished.
 What was the thing when i was much higher in doer language and i am now what was the thing you used to have to tell me all the time i would have to tell you.
 When we would need to leave so that you could see the thing with the doers if you told them okay we're leaving in five minutes at least then they could plan to get as much done in that five minutes as they could.
 and they could be prepared that it isn't going to be complete.
 Right.
 Or I could say, could you tell me when you'd be finished your current task,
 because we need to leave to go to such and such a place.
 And that was an example of you learning to speak the doer language,
 even though you were lower in it than I was.
 Yeah, at the time, yeah.
 Because before you'd just be like, why don't you plan better,
 speaking as a shape or language?
 Like, why did you even start this right now when you knew you only had half an hour?
 But as somebody who flew in the doer language i would focus on the immediate non-necessarily the important right list that's right in front of me whatever i picked up and that could be a game of mario it could be downloading a new app it could be sorting out the clothes on my shelf by color it could be anything.
 If i started this i wanna see it done yeah and there's tremendous strength to that but you can already see that this some weaknesses to that language as well.
 Yeah. So the need for the doer.
 Is appreciation and action. Yeah.
 So a doer at a party is going to be cleaning up,
 but they're going to be cleaning up and they're going to be content to clean up.
 So long as somebody's going, oh my gosh, thank you so much for cleaning up.
 Yes, as long as somebody else is doing their share or somebody's coming along and helping them.
 Yeah. And they feel great. Yeah.
 Otherwise it's likely that they're probably going to slowly, slowly slide down the hill
 into martyrdom. Easy. But yes.
 their passion is just a finish.
  </li><li>Yup, get the thing done.
  </li><li>But their strength is they're trustworthy.
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause they're gonna get the thing done.
 (laughs)
 Yeah, they're great to have on your team or in your life.
 I mean, it's great when you have people
 that speak that language really fluently
 because stuff's gonna happen, stuff's gonna get done.
  </li><li>So we've only covered our top three languages.
 The other four languages would be producer.
 Producers tend to manage really, really well.
 They tend to be very hospitable.
 People tend to be able to produce wealth.
  </li><li>Great, with their finances.
  </li><li>Yeah, then the responder responders
 are amazingly caring, loving people who think of others.
 They tend to be very, very good at conveying love.
  </li><li>Yeah, they're great at knowing
 the emotional temperature of other people.
  </li><li>That's right, there's influencers
 who are the life and soul of parties.
 They tend to be very, very, very fun.
 very outgoing yes and then there are movers and movers can be very direct pioneering people full of passion they are mentally agile and alert and they're all about action they love to just.
 Yes get things done have adventure so there as you can begin understand there's the seven languages we speak all of them we just tend to be more dominant more fluent in some of them.
 and the way we can improve our overall communication skills is learning to understand the languages
 we're less fluent in and start practicing those and then also recognizing the languages of those
 who are around us and speaking to the need of others and being aware of other people's filters
 and just and it's been such a helpful tool so much so that we have everybody who works at
 Grace and our complete a life language profile. And actually part of the school all our students
 go through a life language profile. And so you end up with a community of people who understand
 communication really, really well. And if they choose to, can learn to strengthen the weaker parts
 of their language. The danger, as with any tool, is that people justify their character weaknesses
 by saying, "Well, I'm just a responder, or I'm just a shaper," or which is, of course, not what
 this is about. It's about understanding yourself, about understanding others, and being able to speak
 call these languages.
 And I love the whole thing of bringing up your weaker languages to be able to speak those,
 which really that isn't in myers' breaks or any of those kinds of things.
 You're more pigeonholed into this is what you are and will always be.
 And that's what I love about life languages is it's an opportunity to grow.
 It is amazing to me how many people are resistant to doing something like this because they
 don't want to be pigeonholed.
 Right.
 Because they have been probably.
 And the truth is this doesn't pigeonhole you at all.
 It gives you a very, very thorough understanding of how you're already behaving and gives
 you tools and helps explain how you can grow, where there's areas for self-improvement,
 and more importantly, will highlight the areas of what it looks like when you're in distress
 or other people are in distress.
 Very, very helpful.
 So you're probably listening to this going, "Hey, I love it that you all know your life
 language profile.
 I don't know my life language profile."
 Well, do we have a treat for you?
 Yes, we do.
 We have partnered with our dear friend, Alison Hendrickson,
 who is a licensed life language trainer.
 And if you go to <a href="http://www.taproot7.com/">www.taproot7.com</a>,
 tap root, and then the number seven.com.
 I'll put a link to it in the show notes.
 And click take profile.
 If you enter in the code Jones or lowercase,
 you can receive $5 off the cost of doing a profile.
 I think the cost is like $45 or so.
 It will require about 15 to 20 minutes of your time.
 You just do online.
 If you fill in that, it's gonna be $40 to do the test.
 It will instantly send you a profile
 at the end of doing that.
 And you'll have your profile.
 And next week, we have asked Alison to join us
 on the podcast.
 She's gonna be answering any questions
 you may have about life languages.
 She's also gonna be rounding out some of the languages
 we haven't talked about and correcting any errors we may have made.
 And that's why she's the trained professional and we're just enthusiastic amateurs.
 But I would highly recommend that you take a life language profile.
 That coupon code is valid for the next two weeks.
 This episode goes live on Monday the 9th of November 2015.
 Would encourage you to get it done this week so that you can have your life language profile
 in hand and listen to Alison as she speaks.
 I'd encourage you if you've already done a life language profile, get your significant
 other, get your friends, get the people that you're in close relationship with to do a
 profile to, it would help you understand them, it would help them understand you.
 And we would love you to take advantage of this so that you can learn how to communicate
 better.
 So go to allenonaj.com/76 for a link to everything I just said there and for a link
 to that, including the coupon code if you've forgotten already.
 And they do tell you that if you're not to take it when you're under extreme stress,
 so if your baby is due this week, maybe don't take the profile.
 If you're moving this week, you know, if your wedding's tomorrow, that kind of thing.
 Don't maybe do the profile right now.
 But otherwise, just find 20 minutes when you can just be peaceful and answer the profile
 questions.
 And another thing, if you've done a life language profile in the past, if it's been
 over a year, they recommend you do again just for this season of your life.
 And in fact, AJ and I are going to be retaking our profile this week with you guys.
 And so by next week, we're going to have a fresh profile.
 It's been two years since we've done that.
 I'll be interested in the CFR life languages have changed any.
 Yeah.
 I'm interested to see yours.
 Well, I'm interested to see mine as well, but I never come out or haven't yet come
 out anything but a high shaper as my first, but you've gone up and down a couple of times.
 So it's interesting.
 I've taken three life language profiles in my life so far.
 Yeah.
 And they've changed every time.
 Yeah, I mean I've just gone from a ninety seven to ninety four to eighty seven shaper.
 You know and the other ones have changed around a little bit but they're pretty consistent so if you want notes for this week go to a major dot com slash seventy six if you would like to ask Allison a question for next week's podcast go to a line and a dot com slash ask.
 Perfect alright have a very good week have a good week bless you.
