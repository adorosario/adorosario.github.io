<p> I'll in an AJ's podcast for your Monday
 Most wonderful show is<br/>
 Keeping up with the Joneses<br/>
 Mr Jones<br/>
 Welcome to episode 268 of Keeping Up with the Joneses
 How are you?<br/>
 Cold<br/>
 You look like you just came off a ski slope
 I know I had a different outfit on<br/>
 and I had a new green shirt that I wanted to wear
 Which looked really good, matched your eyes?
 Thank you, very cool though<br/>
 I mean I just, I was like<br/>
 like, oh, I need to basically put on a coat.
</p><ul>
  <li>You heard it here first, probably until April,
 you're gonna hear every week,
 as you say it's so cold in our basement.
  </li><li>It's so cold in our basement.
  </li><li>Yep, that's our weekly update.
  </li><li>There you go.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Speaking of weekly update,
 we had another snow day this week.
  </li><li>We did.
  </li><li>We started the week Monday,
 Martin Luther King Day.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Did you enjoy your day off?
  </li><li>I did.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Thank you, we had such fun having
 Remington on the podcast.
 Thank you to everybody who sent in feedback.
 glad you enjoyed the episode. So we were off Monday work.
 Yes.
 And then the following day, the kids were off school.
 Yes. Yeah, first no day, which is, it's just nice. I mean, honestly,
 my favorite part is that I don't have to get up at 6 a.m.
 So that's the best part.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It's no day. It's apparently going to be 15 degrees tonight,
 which to centigrade people that is,
 I don't know.
 Minus 9.4 degrees Celsius.
 Okay. So it's going to be cold tonight. Wow.
 Don't do that thing where we leave our faucets running and open the cabinet doors,
 which feels like witchcraft.
 But every time I'd done it, we haven't had burst pipes.
 Right.
 But I don't know that we would have burst pipes.
 I'm just getting out of no, no, no, no.
 I just, here's my question.
 Let's stick with it.
 It's for the So I've served our breath in Canada.
 We never did that.
 I love it that you're positioning these questions at me, like suddenly
 I'm a general contractor.
 Exactly.
 But you're the one that goes around and opens up every only because our towns
 folk tell us to do what townsfolk told you to do that.
 Literally everybody in the south tells me to do that.
 I've never had anybody tell me to do that.
 I trust Mr. Bill and Mr. Bill told me that in fact today Mr.
 Bill and Miss Noni said that's what they're going to do tonight.
 And I was like, I just do what they do.
 Okay. All right.
 I still think it's odd.
 Okay. Tonight we won't.
 And if the bursts, if the pipes burst, we'll have a weekly update for next week.
 Okay. Great.
 I can't even do that.
 Oh, okay.
 our homeowners insurance cameras.
 And how's that happened this week?
 How, I mean, how was your week?
 We've had a good week in terms of seeing each other.
 I felt like last week, aside from the fact that we went away for the weekend,
 we just barely saw each other.
 Really?
 Was my memory wrong?
 I don't know.
 I mean, it was a busy week, but I mean, it wasn't like we didn't see each other.
 Yeah, but I mean, hard, hard connection.
 Because you know, I'm big.
 It's so cute, aren't you?
 Yeah.
 Yeah, no, it was a good week.
 We were mostly at home doing Zoom meetings, so.
 We watched the new "Eternals" movie, or the new Marvel movie called "Eternals."
 Yes.
 Two hours and 37 minutes I wasn't ready for that.
 Oh, so long.
 Did you enjoy it?
 No, I mean, it was good.
 I don't think it's the best Marvel movie that I've ever seen or anything, but...
 I would say it's a huge departure for them in tone.
 Yeah, maybe.
 I don't even know if I'm interested enough to even have a conversation about tone.
 I'm going to start my universe podcast and they are not invited.
 I don't even know what that means.
 It'd be like never mind.
 You don't care.
 I can see your eyes.
 But we watched a huge divergent.
 And then else happened, you sweet little nugget.
 Did we already say about Abby's bed?
 You built her bed and all that.
 Yeah, I went out to a forest.
 I fell to a tree.
 I dragged it home as a lumberjack.
 I blamed the tree and I built it with my own.
 I mean, but when you say you built her bed, it was a.
 You had a full day pre-made bed from wherever we are at a wayfare or whatever.
 But I mean, you know, you put it together.
 I did.
 You were her hero.
 Ah, yeah, I met her bed.
 Yes.
 She's in the process of moving from one room to the other and making her new room her little teenage haven.
 Yep.
 It's interesting to watch.
 That was it. That was our weekly update.
 That was it.
 It was bananas.
 I was just thinking about this new course that I'm launching.
 Yeah.
 I say that we are launching.
 I'm not doing it.
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong>
 Let's be super clear.
 That was very definitive.
 OK.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Think about this new course on launching.
 Yes.
 And I'm thinking it's about this time of the month
 that we tend to get our Christmas bills coming.
 Yeah.
 So if you spend money on a credit card,
 it's round about now that you'll get your bills.
 And I was just thinking, and I want to invite our listeners, if you want to end 2022
 in a financially better place than when you started 2022, do I have a course for you?
 Do I have a course for you?
 We, we, it has done nothing.
 I have a question.
 It's something you've done nothing because I keep thinking.
 I lived it with you.
 You know, I just didn't teach it.
 I'm being flippant, but you also created space for me to devote time to doing this.
 Like the notion that you haven't helped create the courses.
 Yeah, that's right.
 No, I'm being serious.
 Like in one sense, we did navigate the life season together.
 Yes.
 We processed the revelation that God was giving us together.
 We chose how we were going to walk that out together.
 We made really costly financial decisions together.
 And you protected my time so that I could devote hours to filming and editing and polishing and creating.
 So I, yeah, but, but still you're the one that's teaching the course.
 I'm the one that's teaching the course.
 But basically it's all about, it's all about finances.
 Here's the thing, we are big Dave Ramsey fans.
 Yes.
 We're still doing his baby steps.
 We loved the Financial Peace University and we still tell people to do all the time.
 One of the things that Davis so good is the practical nuts and bolts.
 One of the things that I noticed was absent, which totally fine, was a lack of focus on the
 supernatural and the spiritual aspects that affect your finances. He touched on it, he talked about
 tithing, he talked about generosity, which is all very good. But our course, our course, that I will
 will be teaching is all about finances. It's all about biblical foundations to partner with God.
 And when it came out of a number of years ago, the Lord started asking me questions that I found
 uncomfortable about why we were the way we were with our finances. And then over the course of a
 year, he started radically challenging me us to think differently and inviting us into stuff that
 we had kind of known. Graham Cook loves to say this. Like he talks about it's not enough to believe
 we have to live fully persuaded. Yeah. And so there's this invitation to tricered and different.
 And as we did that, we saw a radical shift. In fact, such a radical shift, not only in our finances,
 but in our outlook of what was possible, that it was kind of uncomfortable. Do you remember that?
 Yes. And comfortable because like, I'm in new, I remember the first time I went to Japan,
 as a six foot one tall white westerner. Everywhere I looked, I did not belong. I didn't even
 know how to navigate because nothing was in English. Culturally, I was just in a new land
 that I didn't know if what I was doing was the right thing. It felt like that.
 All this goodness, but I didn't know if I was going to do the right thing. Anyway,
 the Lord just kept teaching us and challenging us. Anyway, I put together this course. I think
 I think it's nine lessons.
 It's an exhaustive, comprehensive,
 practical teaching and course, built with you in mind
 to equip you to help you in the most practical ways
 to help partner your finances with heaven
 to give you hope for a future
 that's better than you currently imagine.
  </li><li>Yeah, good.
  </li><li>And yeah, I'm really excited.
 And if that sounds even remotely like something
 you'd be interested in,
 Do me a favor, go to <a href="mailto:allen@ag.com">allen@ag.com</a>/more,
 pop in your email address,
 and I'll send you details about the course.
 And if you know friends that you think,
 man, they might be interested in this,
 or you don't want to go through a course on your own,
 tell them about it, <a href="mailto:allen@ag.com">allen@ag.com</a>/more.
 It's the same thing that if you've done
 like our Finding Father course, our Boundaries course,
 you watch the videos in your own time,
 and then you hop on a call with me, a weekly call,
 where I get to answer your questions, talk about it.
 It's very, very proud of you.
 I'm gonna give you stuff that you can implement almost immediately within the first week of the classes,
 the first lessons.
 There's gonna be stuff for you to fill out, stuff for you to practically think about.
 And I'm just really excited about being with you in 2022 and
 hearing your testimonies of God being radical the way he has been to us.
 &gt;&gt; So good.
 &gt;&gt; AJ Jones. &gt;&gt; Yes.
 &gt;&gt; Is Donna of a new era?
 No, it's not the dawn of a new era.
 It is in the podcasting world.
 Well, no, because the new era would suggest that we're going to continue in this format,
 which no, it is a.
 We're trying something new today.
 And that I not only don't know what our main topic is, but I also don't know where it's
 going to go because you're leading the whole thing.
 The only thing I know is what our listeners question is.
 Okay.
  </li><li>Other than that, I don't know where we're going.
  </li><li>Well, I don't know that this is gonna give you any comfort,
 but I'm not completely sure where we're going either.
  </li><li>I'll tell you this. - But I have a skeleton.
  </li><li>Okay, is this like confession?
  </li><li>No. - Okay.
  </li><li>Like in the closet? (laughs)
 No. - Tell us, what's our main topic?
 So I know how to title this episode.
  </li><li>I'm navigating seasons of waiting.
  </li><li>Navigating seasons of waiting.
  </li><li>Yes. - Okay, where do you wanna start?
  </li><li>Well, so here's how I ended up chatting
 or thinking about this is, of course, Samuel, he--
 Explain who Samuel is.
 Samuel's my therapist.
 Everyone's tomorrow, you know, Samuel asked me some question
 that I'm like, I have to process that for awhile.
 There was a habit of doing that.
 Yeah, I'm like, oh, here we go again.
 I was chatting with him about the weirdness
 of the season that we're in, in that we're
 in this wonderful season where we're following the Lord
 towards adoption.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And we're, we've done all the steps
 that we can physically do,
 you know, practically do all that kind of stuff.
 And now we must wait.
 And we have no control over what the waiting looks like,
 how long the waiting will be.
  </li><li>And no indication to help us along the way.
  </li><li>Right, no indication of whether we'll be waiting
 for a couple of weeks, a couple of months, a couple of years.
  </li><li>I hope we're not in a couple of years
 because our whole study expires.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Yes, I hear you, but I'm just saying like--
  </li><li>We're powerless.
  </li><li>We're powerless over all of it.
 As much as this waiting in this moment
 is a new kind of waiting,
 I'm familiar with seasons of waiting.
 And it doesn't have to be, you know, waiting for adoption
 or waiting for a baby, but just I think
 I wanted to talk a little bit about
 what does it look like to kind of keep your head
 and keep your heart in a season of waiting?
 'Cause I think that's the challenge.
 Nobody likes waiting.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>Right?
 We don't even like waiting 15 minutes for a table.
 Like, well, let's go to a different restaurant.
 It doesn't have a 15 minute wait.
 You know what I mean?
 So that was a job at you.
 Okay.
 Just a.
  </li><li>Guilty is charged.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>It's gonna take us longer than that
 to drive to another restaurant.
 Let's just say.
  </li><li>Well at least it feels like you're doing something.
  </li><li>Yeah, okay.
 Well that's kind of the point.
 But anyway, I was thinking about like,
 okay, if we talked about it practically,
 what can you do in a season of waiting?
 But also, how do we maintain our spirit
 in a season of waiting?
 And then also what do we do for our souls in a spirit of waiting?
 So that's what I want to talk about.
 And I have some thoughts, but I'm hoping you're going to have other thoughts
 because you're brilliant.
 No, I'm on a snow day.
 No, no, you're not on this no day.
 I'll taser you.
 So my first thing was talking about the practical.
 And I had mentioned to you upstairs, I remember listening to a joy
 my teaching. I don't even know how long ago it would have been that I listened to it 25
 years ago, something like that. I mean, a long time.
 Before you were in ministry.
 Yeah. Before I was in ministry, but I knew I was called to ministry. And I had said yes
 to the call, but I hadn't actually seen it start yet. And somebody had given me this
 teaching by her called the silent years. I remember reading it or listening to it rather
 and just being like, "Oh, because one of the things she said is, do all that you can do on your end to be ready so that when the moment comes, you're not wishing you'd gotten ready."
 And I was like, "Right, okay."
 At the time for me, I knew I was, I knew from my prophetic words that I was going to be traveling and I was going to be preaching and things like that, but I didn't currently have anything on the horizon that looked like that.
 So for me, I started preparing sermons and got my passport.
 And just, I mean, I didn't try and crowbar my way into churches.
 I just did anything that was within my realm of doing to do so that if somebody were
 to call and say, Hey, would you come?
 I could go.
 Yeah, I can come because I have my passport and I've spent time with the Lord and I put
 messages together.
 How many messages did you have ready to speak on before you ever got an invite?
 Well, this is kind of funny. I had 30.
 I don't know if I have 30 messages on me today.
 Yeah.
 You prepared 30, 30 messages. It's actually in a binder somewhere over there in the basement.
 But yeah, I had 30 messages.
 You had 30 messages.
 Good to go.
 And I would get people who actually taught like our youth pastors and whatever to go over them,
 like I was going to use them and pick them apart and you know.
 You send them to Patricia King as well and she would give you feedback.
 Yeah. So no invitations.
 Nope.
 But you're doing it.
 But that's because that's all I could do.
 So I thought, all right.
 I'm spotting a slight fly in the ointment.
 Yes.
 I mean, I think everything you said is brilliant and absolutely wise and I appreciate all that.
 Just knowing me and I'm curious if this showed up for you
 is like, I think it is wise to use that time to prepare.
 But I think there's also a danger in my head, I'm thinking, because I'm
 preparing, I'm speeding up the process, which, of course, is fallacy.
 No, I don't think it's better up the process at all.
 But did you fall in the trap of like, OK, and now I'm ready.
 I've got 10 messages.
 Nothing.
 Now I'm ready.
 I've got 20 minutes.
 I did.
 But I also had so much fear of actually doing it in the first place that was
 So I'm just part of me that was like,
 okay, ready, but I'm good for, you know,
 I'm good to wait.
  </li><li>I think it's always funny,
 and maybe this is just my impatience speaking
 in both these questions.
 It is always funny when that thing, right?
 Okay, yeah, I'm gonna use this time,
 and somehow that will speed up God.
 I think that will probably play in the back of my head.
 But the other thing is, and we're in this right now is,
 it wasn't our idea to adopt.
 I mean, we'd flirted with the idea
 and talked about it and we were open to it,
 but it wasn't our idea at this stage of life to start it.
 There's very much the Lord. You've probably heard our story, you know, and so we're now
 we're doing everything. And I mean, even on our website, I probably need to change this,
 but on our adoption page on our website, it's talked about like, now that the longest period is
 behind us, this thing could go really quick, which is still true. It could go really quick.
 But I don't know if it, if we don't know if it will. But my point is, I think I tend to think,
 and I keep getting tripped up because I've read a Bible and there's no real examples of this.
 Well, no, there is, but there's a lot more examples of the opposite.
 Why don't I finish my point?
 Yeah.
 There's a notion that if God asks me and I say yes, then we're off to the races.
 Yes.
 Yeah, because we're like that fast food generation.
 We just want everything quick.
 But like that wasn't true of Abraham and it wasn't true of David and it wasn't true of Noah.
 And you know, and Jesus, his ministry didn't start until he was 30.
 Yeah.
 So there is this notion that well, and also, like if it's taken a long time for you to say yes,
 to God. You know, it was God.
 Then maybe you didn't hear God, right?
 Oh, no, I'm also thinking like, if God is speaking to you about something, and maybe
 he takes him two years to get your yes, you're like, okay, well, let's make up for lost time.
 And it might take years before, like I was a school teacher when God would speak to me
 about sending me around the world to travel, took years before that ever happened.
 And even when I would think, oh, well, this is it.
 And if I go here, I'll get noticed enough for do this.
 And oh, this is the beginning of my ministry.
 Basically, my point is God always seems to move much slower
 than I would have anticipated him doing.
 Is that being true of your experience?
  </li><li>I mean, I guess in some things, yes.
 And then other things I feel like he moves pretty quick.
 But I think anytime that you're in a season where
 whether it's your own heart has long for it
 or you're longing for it
 because the Lord has lit it in your heart.
  </li><li>Right, no way can be.
  </li><li>Those seasons always feel longer
 than they are practically anyway.
 Does that make sense?
 Like you're like, you look back and go,
 actually that was only X amount of months or whatever,
 but when you're living it, it's--
  </li><li>Practical example.
  </li><li>You know.
  </li><li>When we were trying to get pregnant with Abigail,
 our firstborn, it actually only took 10 months.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Which 10 months is a very short period of time.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But those 10 months fell years.
  </li><li>Or whatever.
  </li><li>And you know, until it happened,
 maybe it will never happen.
  </li><li>Yeah, and in the midst of those 10 months,
 we had 14 friends that got pregnant.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So, I mean, which you can have the equivalent of that too,
 where you're like, whether you're talking about
 walking into your calling, or the job that you've always
 been dreaming about, or getting married, or whatever,
 like it always seems like every time somebody else gets
 the thing that you're waiting for, it feels like
 the weight just got longer somehow.
 Kind of like God's short handed on miracles and,
 you know what I mean?
 So I was thinking like practically you can do
 whatever you can do to prepare for us right now
 with what we're practically trying to get ready for.
 We don't really know what we're trying to get ready for
 in some ways.
  </li><li>In some ways, but in other ways,
 have you made a list yet, baby?
 For, have you started nesting?
 Have you made like a list of things we need?
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
 Have you registered for a baby?
 Okay, of course you have.
 Yeah.
 I love keeping in mind.
 Let's just stop and appreciate your paper.
 Well, it just dawned on me.
 Oh, yeah, that's something we could do.
 And I'm like, have you done it?
 Because you haven't spoken to me about any of it.
 Oh, yeah.
 I've researched like I've researched rollers and baby seats and all the things.
 But also moving Abigail into a new bedroom is we're preparing a nursery.
 Yes.
 So that yeah, when we have a baby or a child, there's that room is there's a room ready and yeah, so we're doing like whatever we can.
 And I'm trying to do research on I haven't figured this one out yet, but like best organic baby formulas and things like that.
 You know what I mean?
 So that because we've seen a couple different situations now and we're aware.
 Hey, it could be we only have a week or two notice.
 They also could be we have three months notice.
 I want to front end as much of it as I can in terms of look at this.
 I want to front end.
 Well, even like in terms of like doing the research and not having to do anything under
 pressure that I would have preferred to have time to contemplate.
 And again, I'm a second language contemplating.
 So, content.
 But if you don't know what we're talking about with shape and contemplate, I'll put link
 in the show notes, the life languages.
 It's a communication profile that you can take.
  </li><li>That's what we're talking about.
  </li><li>Yeah, super helpful, super helpful.
  </li><li>And in being able to understand yourself.
  </li><li>Contaminers love to think.
  </li><li>So I was thinking like, okay,
 so we're doing practical things.
 So you do your best to do whatever the practical things are
 in the moment for spiritual things,
 although this is slightly practical as well.
 So maybe it's a transitional thought.
 My thing is like, all right,
 and now I do my best job now with what is before me
 me to do right now because I think also I have currently three children, a husband,
 a job.
 And so if I'm living so for the future, you'll neglect your and getting, you know, hung
 up in the waiting, I'll actually forget to love and appreciate and take care of and take
 responsibility for all the things that are actually my current reality.
 And so, and I was thinking even with like when I was waiting to go into ministry, I was like,
 okay, so these doors haven't opened yet.
 But what I do have is a job that I can give 110% to and a church that I can volunteer
 at.
 Yeah.
 And you know whatever.
 And so what is before me to do right now that I can do well instead of, I think if you
 don't you end up in the place of like grumbling over the waiting?
 Because you forget.
 You become more aware of the lack of the thing being there.
 Yeah.
 Then longing for the thing to be here.
 Yeah.
 So thinking about that, but then I was also thinking like spiritually in a
 season of waiting.
 I mean, look at Joseph, right?
 Why are you smiling at me?
 I'm what I'm smiling about is I love hearing you talk, first of all.
 OK.
 And I love hearing you process.
 Yeah.
 And I love that a lot of this came out of you talking to Samuel.
 Like eight hours ago and I'm like, you've had a lot of time to think about this.
 Well, I've been cleaning the house all day pondering.
 Yeah, I left.
 I went out with a friend all day and I just come back and we need to record a podcast.
 And so
 how do you come back?
 Oh, it's amazing.
 But amazing.
 Yeah.
 So my, my smile is the gladness in hearing.
 all of this passion tumble eye review.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So here was my thought.
 My thought was like when you consider you're talking about
 like there's all these Old Testament people
 who they all had a season of waiting
 which often feels like a season of testing.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And again, thinking about Joseph,
 we've talked about Joseph plenty.
 He's a great example from many things,
 but him knowing something was coming, not fully knowing,
 you know, what that's gonna look like,
 but it's gonna look radically different
 in his current scenario, but then hitting so many huge roadblocks.
 I mean, not just speed bumps, but like, okay,
 now you're in slavery, just kidding, now you're in prison.
 But him obviously staying the course
 because of how everybody responds to him
 and because of the favor he keeps getting shown,
 somehow he's managing his internal dilemma
 or angst or whatever, enough that no matter
 what the circumstances are of the waiting,
 He's still positioned for favor.
 Yeah.
 You know?
 And so I feel like there's a challenge in that to manage ourselves,
 like to, to, and go, oh, right now I'm leaking in terms of like something negative.
 I'm leaking.
 That's going to affect my environment.
 I'm allowed to be stressed.
 I'm allowed to be wanting this to go faster.
 I'm allowed to have all the feelings, but I also do need to take responsibility for
 them and manage them, whatever.
 And so I was thinking a little bit about what does it look like to help
 ourselves in the season of waiting?
 So what did you come out with?
 Well, have a couple of thoughts.
 Okay.
 You are on a roll.
 You are on fire.
 So I think historically what has helped me the most in any season where the
 Lord has said, Hey, I'm going to do this.
 Um, or Hey, let's go do this.
 Uh, and then it feels like it's taking a long time.
 we've actually had a lot of those moments, right?
 And many of them to do with finances,
 and you know, but lots of those moments.
 And I was thinking about how, you know,
 in the Old Testament, the Lord would encourage them
 when there was a place of breakthrough
 to build a monument, right?
 And the monument wasn't for God,
 it was for them to remember that God showed up.
  </li><li>Wow.
 And so my thought was in a season where you're waiting again,
 and whatever that waiting looks like right now,
 to look back at the monuments that you've built with the Lord,
 where you've had the same thing,
 whether it's, you know,
 it's probably not exactly the same circumstances,
 but you, we all have a history of,
 I believe God, there was a season of waiting,
 it was really awful, it was really hard,
 but I broke through and yay!
 And then again, to I think part of what we can do is look back at those and go, God, you are faithful.
 I know you to be kind.
 I know you to be good.
 I know you to be faithful.
 And I'm reminding myself, you broke through for me here.
 You said this and then broke through here.
 You said this and then broke through here.
 You said, you know, and you are still that person.
 So, you know, just sort of speaking to your spirit, like be encouraged, you know.
 And then I was also thinking of just like things like reading
 Ephesians and Philippians and some of those these books that are
 in my mind, they're the tone of them is so elevated, like in terms of how
 encouraging they are to hang on to God and to push in and whatever.
 And again, knowing he's writing them from prison, knowing he's writing them
 in the midst of not having the breakthrough.
 But he is knowing he'll see the breakthrough
 because he's seeing God break through for him time and time again.
 And so like I know for myself, I had said this to the school.
 Like when I in seasons where I'm like, oh, I'm struggling.
 I quite literally open Ephesians.
 Wow.
 Because it's my go to like start reading Ephesians.
 I, you know, Romans works for me too, even though Romans is like
 super long, but Ephesians is shorter if you're needing a quick hit, you know.
 But just and read like, oh, he's so faithful, you know, from someone who's in prison and is still
 choosing to declare faithfulness. And to me, that just encourages my spirit like, yep, we're good.
 Like, do I enjoy waiting? No, nobody enjoys waiting, you know. Do I wish we had a plan?
 Yes, I'm a high shaper.
 I want a plan.
 I want a date.
 I want something to aim at it.
 I want it, you know, but hey, guess what?
 He's good.
 You know what I mean?
 And I'm going to focus on that.
 Do you have any other thoughts about caring for your spirit
 and waiting?
 Yeah.
 I think looking at your prophetic words, you know,
 Paul wrote to Timothy and just as you know, by them,
 you fight the good fight.
 And so I think looking back on your prophetic words
 and allowing them to encourage you,
 because at least speaking personally,
 I know that I get a prophetic word
 and think it's gonna happen tomorrow.
  </li><li>Or we want it to.
  </li><li>Yeah, okay, this, you know.
 Like I was laughing because very early on
 in our relationship with David Wagner,
 he was in town, I don't think we'd even met him personally yet,
 but we went over to Legacy,
 and he was, you remember when Legacy was meeting
 their old old old location?
 And we went there and it was getting late
 and we had a babysitter to get back to it.
 And so we just tried to sneak out surreptitiously.
 And David just called us out by our names
 to remember as we were trying to leave.
 We're just on our way out.
 And David's like, "I heard you asked the Lord a question,
 can we go to Iceland for the weekend?"
 And the Lord says, "Yes, you can."
 And he just started prophesying over us,
 traveling and everything.
 And that night I went home,
 made sure our passport was up to date.
 And I hadn't done this yet
 because we just moved here.
 But I researched what was the best airline to fly
 out of Nashville.
 And I just started doing all this research.
 And I think I even got,
 like I think I ordered some stuff for travel.
 Now, I don't think we went to Iceland
 for a couple of years after that,
 but it tickled me pink.
 I came home to the-- - No, I don't think you're right.
 I think it was, I think it was a couple of months after that.
 I don't think it was very long.
  </li><li>It was years.
  </li><li>I remember thinking, can I over show that one, Jones?
 I mean, you were, you were prepared.
 But, you know, and so, because I think I remember going,
 well, I mean, I guess maybe David Mister,
 I guess maybe I missed it.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But when the time did come,
 I remember we were on an airplane,
 and, you know, so I can't believe we're going to Iceland
 for the weekend.
  </li><li>That picture just came up in my screenshot yesterday.
 The picture of us on the airport, yeah.
  </li><li>Anyway, I think looking at your prophetic words,
 reminding yourself of your prophetic words,
 asking for encouragement and input, super helpful.
  </li><li>Yeah, and I think too, if you've shared your prophetic words
 or shared with your close circle of friends or whatever.
 Whatever the Lord is speaking to you about,
 then they can actually encourage you
 when you're having your like, oh my gosh, you know,
 kind of days.
  </li><li>I think another key thing is to celebrate
 other people's breakthrough,
 especially if it's in the area of the breakthrough you need.
  </li><li>Yeah, for sure.
  </li><li>So we were trying to get pregnant for 10 months
 and I don't know how many people go for it.
  </li><li>14, yeah. - So celebrate.
  </li><li>I remember.
  </li><li>You went to get married, like you've been divorced
 and you had this prophetic word about this strong handsome hunk of a man,
 body of a Greek god coming from the fair islands of Scotland.
 And I hadn't shown up. How many bridesmaids?
 Oh, I don't know how many times I've been a bridesmaid.
 I mean, seriously, pretty close to your 27 dresses.
 And so you're waiting for me and, you know, it's important to celebrate.
 Same with financial breakthrough.
 Like I remember we were wanting to buy a house.
 Remember we really wanted a house.
 And then our friends, Gary and Morgan, Gary and Sarah,
 out with a blue were given a house.
 And I'm like, they don't even wanna have it.
  </li><li>I didn't wanna house.
  </li><li>And I was like, no, no, no, no, no,
 position your heart, like genuinely be happy for them.
 So I think, you know, waiting,
 you talked about waiting being a testing season.
 Sure is.
  </li><li>Well, I also think like,
 'cause you mentioned the Gary and Sarah thing
 and I think we've told that story before,
 but for me, my immediate reaction wasn't,
 I was happy for them.
 I was like, what?
 They don't even want a house.
  </li><li>Right.
 and actually having to take a few hours to have a conversation with the Lord and realize he doesn't have crocodile arms and you know all that kind of stuff.
 So even if you find like you're hearing us talk right now and you're going, "Oh, I don't think I have celebrated other people when they've had the breakthrough."
 Totally fine. You can have an attitude tune up anytime you want.
 And it's your day.
 Let's carry for your spirit.
 How do you care for your soul and your body?
 Well, I think, well, that's great.
 I hadn't really thought about body,
 but I think I really hadn't, you know.
 Oh, you just mentioned it.
 I don't think I did.
 Oh, I feel it in the gap.
 But body's good.
 Yeah.
 Because really you did need to care for all of you
 in any season, but I think in any season of waiting
 is a season of stress.
 Yeah.
 For most people.
 No, I mean, I don't know people that love waiting.
  </li><li>Yeah, just do an airport and walk.
  </li><li>I'm certainly not one of them.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>So carrying for your body, I would say for me,
 and I haven't been very faithful with this
 the last couple of weeks, but exercise actually helps me
 de-stress.
  </li><li>How about couples and such?
  </li><li>Yeah, but also things like having a day of rest,
 going to bed at a decent time, and unfortunately,
 what I'm eating, 'cause usually when I'm stressed,
 I want to not care about what I'm eating,
 'cause I'm like, I'm too stressed to care about
 what I'm eating, but then I feel like garbage,
 and then I feel even worse.
  </li><li>So true.
  </li><li>And I don't seem to learn that lesson.
  </li><li>No, and you know this,
 'cause you live with me, when I eat sugar or chocolate,
 like over Christmas, I just was like, you know,
 then I say I weren't coming,
 so now I'm justified to eat whatever I want.
 But I remember, like, I don't mean I was falling
 into depression, like clinical depression.
 But I remember all my thoughts being so heavily influenced
 in a negative direction.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And as soon as I cut out sugar,
 it's not like I backed back and suddenly I was happy.
 It was just an absence of those things.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So like, yeah, what you eat
 and how much you sleep and exercise is a big deal.
  </li><li>Yeah, all those things are important.
 And I think we want them not to be as important,
 or certainly I do.
 I don't know if you're gonna file a sundur,
 soul care or body care.
 Okay.
 But I also think about therapy,
 a big shock, Ellen thinking about therapy.
 Would that come under soul?
 I think that would come under soul.
 I'll save it for soul though.
 Well, we can go to soul now.
 I don't have any other thoughts on body
 'cause I didn't really think about that.
 But I was thinking for soul care.
 Yes, I mean, I think part of how I'm caring for my soul
 in this season is I see a therapist.
 Yeah.
 And so I can go in there
 have all my feelings and all of my ponderings.
 I was thinking about that this week that therapy is amazing.
 If you have a good therapist and we've talked about that before, but in one
 sense, the cynical of you is like, why can't we see a therapist talking about
 doesn't change anything?
 You're absolutely right.
 Talking about it does not change this, the external circumstances that are,
 doesn't speed up the process, doesn't change other people.
 But what it does is it changes how all those things are affecting you.
 Yes.
 And you might not even feel like it's changing anything, but having a dialogue with
 somebody, having a scaled outside perspective or being validated in the
 middle of the, you know, whatever being offered a different lens to look
 through at the same situation.
 Oh, so powerful and really, really kind to your soul.
 Yeah.
 I was also thinking about stuff like still enjoying life.
 You know what I mean?
 Like, so like, because I think sometimes we're like, okay, God, Freddie, I'm geared up for
 whatever.
 And then I can be super tempted to like, now we don't do anything else until we know about
 this baby.
 Right.
 Alien everything else because we're focusing on this.
 Right.
 So like, like even with our anniversary, we had had a conversation of do we not, do we
 not even go?
 I mean, we're getting ready for a baby.
 We'll be with your birthday as well.
 Like, do we want to celebrate your birthday because we might be.
 Yeah.
 And there can be this temptation to just sort of lock down a weight, you know, and
 grit through.
 And I think actually it's probably more important to still celebrate in the moment and realize,
 hey, I actually need to have some fun.
 And I need to consider not just what my body needs, but just what like what I need as a
 human as a human as a wife as a mom.
 So we're doing things like we're still dating.
  </li><li>We are.
  </li><li>Trying to prioritize playing with the kids.
 And partially I'm like,
 right, I'm probably gonna paint a room with Abby tomorrow,
 so I'll have to help me paint them terrified,
 'cause I'm so picky about painting.
 But we're gonna paint together.
 (laughing)
 But like realizing--
  </li><li>I can't wait for week to catch up, actually.
  </li><li>There's so many sweet moments to be had
 if you're paying attention to what you need in the moment.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And paying attention for me as a mom
 and you as a dad to what our kids need in the moment to you
 because I don't want them to,
 and I don't think they will
 'cause I think we've, I hope we've done a good job
 but I don't want them to remember the season
 of waiting for a baby as like, oh my gosh, we did.
  </li><li>Like drop it on hold.
  </li><li>Yeah, life got put on hold.
 It's not on hold, I have three other children.
 You know.
  </li><li>I was also thinking about,
 of where this fits in, soul, body, or spirit, but the importance of sewing where you want
 to go.
 Yeah.
 So long as you're not doing that to try and speed up the Lord.
 Right.
 If you try to do any of these things in an effort to speed up the Lord.
 Yeah, let me help you out, Lord.
 Yeah.
 But the importance of sewing where you want to go and investing in your future is so,
 so important.
 For sure.
 How do you feel?
 That's the end of my thoughts.
 You just did like this kind of downhill ski of your thoughts.
 Yeah.
 I mean, I think I feel fine.
 I don't know if it was as succinct as it might have been
 if I, I don't know, like written it out or whatever,
 but I'm good.
  </li><li>I gladness being with you and watching you down it.
 I would like to reward you with a listener's question.
  </li><li>Oh, that sounds so exciting, I think.
  </li><li>This is a question from Caleb and Bailey.
 And they say this, "We have a five-year-old daughter
 "and a two-year-old son.
 On a recent podcast, you mentioned that you spoke with your children about pornography and why it is bad.
 At what age do you do this?
 What are some resources I can use in the future as I navigate this topic?
 It's like swimming upstream because it's not the norm in Christian culture to talk about these things.
 We'd love to hear your input.
 At what age did we talk about these things?
 Can I jump in?
 Yeah, go ahead.
 Our conversation about pornography with our kids didn't come out of a...
 you know, a desert place like we've tried to as parents being very open with our
 children about everything. I mean, everything, whether it's, you know, our job,
 about money, about, you know, they were really tiny. We would talk to them about
 like the parts of their body that that only they get to touch.
 Or a doctor or a mommy. Yeah, we didn't use like code names for them.
 code names for anything was like, you know, this is your vagina, this is your penis.
 Nobody gets to, you know, and we would talk about that in non shaming.
 Yeah.
 Ways we up until a certain age, we were very comfortable with our kids being around us when
 we were naked so that we're not trying to demystify or hide from them.
 Well, we are trying to demystify.
 Oh, what did I say?
 Here you said we're not trying to demystify.
 We're trying to have healthy body.
 Yeah, there's not shame about and in the process we'd kind of let them set the pace because kids are great at asking question. Yeah, you know, like, what's that and why does she have that and I don't just, you know, making it with our faces and with our body language that you haven't asked a bad question or a weird question or an uncomfortable question.
 And we've still tried to do that.
 And you're watching for age appropriateness.
 And we've probably had the conversation about sex,
 about your bodies, about pornography,
 over and over and over with different revisions,
 different terminology, different language,
 different amount of detail as they go over.
  </li><li>And probably not huge sit down conversations.
 They're sort of more naturally happening stuff
 at the dinner table or whatever.
 And so not like, guys, we're now all gonna sit down.
 and talk about pornography, which, you know, I feel like that makes it like a,
 but just being able to talk about.
 Before we ever talked about pornography, we would talk like you said, we would name their body parts and we would tell them why they're called their private parts and why they're special and who gets to see them and who gets to touch them and prepare the kids.
 I remember telling each of our kids, Hey, it might happen as you go up that you might have friends who want to see your private parts or might want to touch them or might want to talk about them.
 I want to talk about them and it's your job to say no, it's my body.
 And if they do do that, come and tell us about it.
 And we're trying to make it like a throwy comment.
 And we've done it.
 We've also said that, you know, with sitters or whatever, like,
 Oh, absolutely.
 Hey, and then we've told the sitters when they come over, hey, they're very aware.
 It would always after we'd have a babysitter would say, how was the babysitter
 last night?
 Did you have fun?
 Were they safe?
 Did they do or say anything made you feel uncomfortable?
 Yeah.
 Or a case, not every time we'd say to them,
 we'd touch your private parts,
 but we'd bring up here and there.
 But also, because you would normalize that,
 I can think of at least one of our kids,
 maybe two of our kids who've had experiences
 when they're young, playing with friends who said,
 oh, so and so wanted to, wanted me to take my clothes off.
 But I said, no, it's my body and I came and told them.
 And then we could go to the parents and say,
 hey, like this happened.
  </li><li>So you're aware this what happened, yeah.
  </li><li>Trying to de-shame it.
 So we've always had that conversation.
 probably with pornography where we would get very,
 when I say very detailed,
 let me tell you exactly what we'd say,
 is when our kids got iPhones, right?
 When they got iPads, they were locked down.
 They couldn't do anything.
 They can't access the internet.
 Every app they have to ask us and we approve.
  </li><li>Yeah, but now both the girls have iPhones.
  </li><li>And they got their iPhones when they were 12?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>'Cause they're going to middle school.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>The reason we gave them iPhones is their bus
 is about a 30 minute ride.
  </li><li>A little bit longer, yeah.
  </li><li>A little bit longer.
 And so we gave them a cell phone,
 but here's the pornography part was part of
 responsible use for having a cell phone.
 Okay, here's your cell phone.
 It's got a camera on it.
 This is gonna be a weird thing,
 but never, ever, ever take a picture of yourself naked, ever.
 And if anybody ever sends a picture of themselves naked,
 tell my mommy and daddy immediately.
 You understand that?
 Yeah.
 Okay, your phone automatically switches off
 with iCloud, you can use what's it called?
 Screen time?
 Where like, our iPhones, their iPhones aren't able to use,
 able to be used until a certain time in the morning
 and then at night they get shut off.
 They can always call or text us.
  </li><li>That's it.
  </li><li>And they never get their phones in their bedrooms overnight.
 You always charge your phone outside.
  </li><li>They know that we look at their phones.
  </li><li>Yeah, you also know that mom and daddy
 get to look at your phones and we never want you
 to text anything that you wouldn't be comfortable
 saying to somebody if mommy and daddy were standing right next to you.
 And if you ever get anything, so it'd make you feel uncomfortable.
 And in the context of that, we would say, Hey, listen, no matter what
 mommy and daddy do, there's always going to be stuff that's going to come
 that we wouldn't want you to see.
 And so we have to ask you to protect yourself.
 But we trained them with that from a very early age.
 We set a standard of what they're allowed to see.
 Yeah.
 Like we didn't like our kids doing any Halloween stuff.
 So even your most benign, you know, wholesome American cartoon
 when Halloween comes round, there's going to be Halloween content.
 And we just got, we just trained our kids from a very early age to self
 moderate that there's a Halloween thing.
 We'd skip the episode.
 Yeah.
 So just kind of building and building and building.
 And then we talked to our kids about consequence.
 And that's how we've done it.
 I don't know if we've done a good job or not, but that's how we
 And just again, I think the most important thing is that you can talk about anything.
 You can ask any question that you're not going to get shamed for having a question
 or having seen something or any of those things.
 I love that I asked you the question and then I just got excited and answered the whole thing.
 I apologize.
 OK, well, listen, I'll do your favorite.
 I answered the question.
