<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>AJ Jones?
  </li><li>Yes, sir.
  </li><li>How are you and all your resplendent, Gloria?
  </li><li>I am good, I'm concerned I'm not as good as you are,
 though, because you are wearing a watermelon shirt.
  </li><li>But I try and influence you,
 and my shirt game has been strong,
 and you're down here in a sweater, which reminds me.
 Last couple of days, we've had a heat advisory in Tennessee.
  </li><li>Yes. - You know it has to be
 especially hot, like it's always hot,
 but to have a heat advisory means it's ridiculously hot.
 And so we're leaving for work yesterday.
 Siri's notified me, it's a heat advisory.
 I see Ajay go over and pick up her winter fleece
 and bring it with her.
 Only my wife would drink a fleece in a--
  </li><li>Well, but that is because I sit in rooms
 that have air conditioning that is set by men.
  </li><li>I sat in the same room as you yesterday
 for that meeting and it was way too hot
 because nobody sets the air conditioning
 in proper temperature.
  </li><li>I was quite happy with my fleece.
  </li><li>And we need a kick starter,
 a gray center to buy air conditions to work.
  </li><li>I feel like you're trying to get off topic
 because what I wanna know is how many watermelon shirts
 does one man need?
  </li><li>I only have two.
 I only have two watermelon shirts.
  </li><li>I question whether any man needs two watermelon shirts.
  </li><li>It comes back down to the fact that I just
 don't enjoy clothes shopping.
  </li><li>Yes, I'm familiar with that.
  </li><li>I like clothes.
 I just don't like it enough to put in the amount of effort.
 Like if I had a personal shopper for me, I would love it.
 But I don't and so--
  </li><li>So watermelons.
  </li><li>No, I wasn't old Navy and they had a sale on
 and I just grabbed every shirt they had in my size.
 And it was this.
 And so, you know, it was watermelon last year
 and I got watermelon this year and what can I say?
  </li><li>Yes.
 Well, that's very interesting.
  </li><li>We can match.
  </li><li>Ish.
 green rind on here. Sure. You know, where you're watermelon.
 Sure. This is exactly the kind of matching that gives me grave concern, but we can talk about that later.
 Okay. Yeah. Weekly update. Well, we're back in the swing of things. Kids are in school.
 Not ready for that. You're not? Well, it's too late. I think so we now have a high schooler.
 Abi, our eldest has gone into high school. We have a middle schooler. T is now in middle
 school and then we have a third grader. That's okay. That put you in a passage of time. I think
 I think the thing that hit me is our 14 year old,
 our high schooler got a job as well.
  </li><li>I was, I think I had like actual trauma.
  </li><li>That's the big life shift for me, that she now works.
  </li><li>At a restaurant.
  </li><li>At a restaurant.
 And I'm like, this is like, but I remember having a job
 when I was 14, I remember.
 I liked having money when I was 14,
 but just cognitively that's that.
 I'm about to drop you off at a restaurant.
 I eat all the time and you're gonna work,
 I'm not ready for that.
 She's also said, "By the way, we're not allowed to eat
 while she's working at that restaurant.
  </li><li>It says who?
  </li><li>Her rather strongly.
 And with the same fierce eyes that you have.
  </li><li>Oh, well, I have to see.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Yeah, it's bad to swing a thing.
 I had an eye appointment on Monday.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>They're still brown.
  </li><li>It's always comical 'cause I take this off.
 I literally can't see a thing.
 But what I've noticed is I now like to read my phone.
 I'm okay here, but as the day goes on, I get tired.
 I have to take my glasses off and I have to hold them here.
 And so the optician was like--
  </li><li>I have the opposite issue.
 The more tired I get, I need the person next to me
 to hold my phone further away.
  </li><li>Or when you're podcasting.
 But the optician said, hey, it's probably now time
 for some progressives.
 And I was like, well, that's gonna be weird because,
 he said, it's fine, you just look where you point your nose
 where you want to look instead of moving your eyes.
 So you're gonna have to retrain yourself.
  </li><li>Here's the thing though, like I did think about LASIK,
 you know where they do that,
 but the more I read about it, the more I'm like, no,
 like it's shining a laser in your eyes.
 I'm sure it's all okay and I'm sure they've got
 great safety record, but it just, like they're like,
 oh, we give you a Valium.
 I'm like, how about like several Valium?
  </li><li>Because you're awake during the whole thing
 and they tell you to look in a certain place
 and not look away from it and things like that, yeah.
 But apparently that failsick switches where the laser detects if your eye looks somewhere else which you know I'm not going to be able to look in a certain place.
 For an along period of time.
 I know it'd be interesting to record though.
 Even in the exam where they're like okay look at the light look at the light.
 Or no the thing where you have to click every time you see a wiggly line.
 Yeah and you know that I'm having to refocus it's only with one eye and I'm like this isn't you know I'm sure I screwed up.
 Maybe I don't need progressives after all.
 Yeah, you just probably failed to test.
 I have a question.
 You this feels like a set up because you're casual.
 I have a question.
 One of our podcast listeners mentioned to me,
 one of your purchases that you're like, man, we just need to get this.
 I'm going to use it all the time and asked how you've been doing with the power washer.
 Well, I never said I'd be using it all the time.
 OK, it was one of those purchases.
 Can you clarify for me if you've even opened the box?
 Well, let's not do it that way.
 Well, why?
 Let's just round it up to the number of times I've used it to the closest 10.
 I've used it like 10 times.
 You've used it not at all.
 Rounding into the nearest 10.
 Let's just use it 10 times.
 You haven't even broken the tape on the box.
 Not true. The box is open.
 OK, that must have happened recently.
 Well, I had to cut the box open because I was like,
  </li><li>There's this big box.
 (laughing)
 And I open them to see what it was.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, but then you don't actually have an opening.
 That's just the packaging box.
 There's a box inside where it's sitting inside.
  </li><li>You know, we've had a busy season of life.
  </li><li>Yeah, we needed that.
 We needed that.
  </li><li>Well, we will.
  </li><li>Yes, we'll power wash the children with it later.
  </li><li>Someone's gonna get a power wash for us.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>You know, it's one of those future purchases
 that you will thank me one day.
  </li><li>Oh, yes, I'm sure.
 Absolutely.
 You're still sneaky. Oh, I've got a non-free meditated question.
 I actually made a note of it so that I would remember.
 So sneaky.
 For today, to ask you.
 Yeah.
 So.
 The only other thing that's noteworthy is I got a new game, the Legend of Zelda.
 What's it called?
 Skyward Sword.
 Something's core.
 HD.
 Sword.
 And we took it on vacation.
 We did.
 And I put the kiss to bed one night and I settled down to play it.
 And my worst nightmare came true after playing more than 50 hours of this video game.
 Yeah, I mean, not in a row over several weeks.
 You played 50 hours over 50 hours, one of my children who shall remain
 nameless, but he's really cute.
 He's really cute.
 Overrope my game.
 Yeah.
 And so I had to start from scratch, which is one of those moments where I was like, oh,
 it's OK.
 I don't think I got that far.
 And it all it was, was I completely forgotten how far I'd gotten and it took forever to get back.
 Well, I want to say, well, so we had gone on a date back to the animal kingdom, right?
 Yes.
 To just have like a state and thinking that the park was going to stay open and then it wasn't.
 And so then we went and wandered around Disney Springs and came home.
 And so our plan was you were going to play a video game for a while.
 I was going to read them. We go to bed, you know, and as you're looking
 at this file, you're like, wait, all my things are gone.
 And you handle it great.
 I probably would not have handled it that well.
 If I accidentally deleted your breath of the wildfire.
 Oh, I'd be so sad.
 Well, which one?
 Because I have three.
 I have the one that's 100%.
 I'd be very sad about that one.
 Well, let's just test your results.
 I don't think we should.
 I don't think we should.
 So you thought I handled that well?
 Mm-hmm.
 Does that make up for not using a pressure washer
 that we had to buy?
 No, you still need to.
 I think we should film some sort of live video the first time you use the pressure washer.
 I don't know when that will happen, but you know, whenever it is.
 Yes.
 Nothing.
 Nothing checking with me at a later date.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Our topic for this week is to follow up on last week.
 We gave you a brief synopsis of our Disney vacation.
 Yes.
 conversation this week with Sarah Parsons, one of our pastors at
 Grace Center. And she said, I really want to talk to you about
 your fascination with Disney World, because you know, you've,
 you've been there, it seems like it's a great source of joy. You
 know, I want to get there. And I'm reminded of a conversation I
 had with our kids, because when you go to Disney World, there is a
 sliding scale on the one side of the scale, there was what I
 would call, you know, people who are tourists who are just at
 Disney World. Yeah, they're in Florida already. They came to
 Disney World.
  </li><li>On the other end, you got people who would
 be kind to say they're Disney fanatics.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>We are not Disney fanatics.
 I'm sorry, remember, explain the kids.
  </li><li>No, like we don't have Disney stuff all over the house
 or anything like that.
  </li><li>No, but we do have wonderful Disney memories.
  </li><li>Memories, yes.
  </li><li>But I'm explaining to the kids that
 we're not a Disney fanatic,
 and the kids are just letting me finish my preamble,
 and they're like, "Dad, just to be clear,
 "as they're looking at me wearing a Disney hat."
 And we spent like several hours trying to find
 you a Disney hat while being a Disney world.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You know, for six days,
 and so we're not a Disney world,
 but no, there is a sliding scale.
 And our history with Disney goes back to,
 what started with me,
 I don't know how old I was,
 I first went to Disneyland on the way back from New Zealand.
 My parents lived in New Zealand for a year
 when I was very young.
 I don't even remember living.
 I've got like a fleeting memory of living in New Zealand.
 I must have been three or maybe four.
 I texted my sister who knows all things.
 And on the way back apparently from Auckland via LA
 to back to Britain, my parents took me to Disney World.
 And I do remember having a Donald Duck hat
 that would quack when you would squeeze it.
 And I remember losing the Donald Duck hat on the airplane.
 I remember being distraught.
 That's all I remember about Disneyland.
  </li><li>Oh, that's so cute.
 You had a Donald Duck hat?
  </li><li>That would quack when you would squeeze it.
  </li><li>Oh, that's so cute.
  </li><li>I nearly bought another one.
 Oh my gosh, I wish they could see pictures of you
 when you were little, 'cause you were like the cutest little kid.
 Thanks, babe.
 Yeah.
 The members kind of yeah, we could--
 I don't know any pictures of me in a Donald Duck hat.
 Well, not in a Donald Duck hat, but it's not a stretch to picture
 that Donald Duck hat.
 We could fold a stop at it.
 We could fold a stop at it.
 So cute with your dimpled chin and your big brown eyes and yeah.
 Yeah, big teeth.
 The little tint is still there and big teeth is still there
 and big brown eyes.
 So Disneyland was my earliest memory.
 But where it started for us was our honeymoon.
 Yes. Talk about our honeymoon.
 So, well, I mean, that's an entirely different story.
 Okay, the good part about honeymoon was Disney,
 but it was really funny because when we were talking about going on honeymoon
 and you were like, "I really want to go to Disney World."
 I was like, "What? Are we children?"
 No, I want to go to a beach somewhere.
 You've never said that though.
 And well, I think when I thought honeymoon, I thought beach chill out, you know, nice food,
 nap a lot. And you wanted nap in quotation marks. No, but actual nap too. And you suggested Disney
 World. And to begin with, I wasn't thrilled with that idea.
  </li><li>I only found out in retrospect, you never raised your,
 I wasn't thrilled with the idea.
 No, you seemed quite okay with it.
 So you were secretly thinking, what the heck are we doing?
  </li><li>Well, it seemed you were so excited about the idea.
 I do remember thinking, there's nothing
 that I'm particularly excited about doing.
 I just never considered that Disney
 would be a honeymoon location.
  </li><li>And again, I don't know where that came from.
 The only tentative link, tenuous link rather,
 that I've got to that, is again,
 I remember being a little boy and I remember one of the only times I saw my dad impressed
 was he came back from Epcot and he told us like he went at a great length to tell us
 about the jumping waterfalls.
 Yes.
 And it was like one of the most amazing things he'd ever seen.
 I think probably as a kid, I remember, I mean, I must have remember thinking if this was
 noteworthy to my dad, I must see this at some point in my life.
 Yes.
 That's one thing.
 Again, from the age of eight, I've always wanted to be an American,
 and I probably conflated America and Disney World as one thing.
 Like what's more American than drinking Coca-Cola?
 You mean the happiest place on Earth and the happiest country on Earth?
 Right.
 And so I'm, I, because again, I don't remember the passion for our honeymoon to be at Disney World.
 Oh, you were super. Yeah.
 No, no, I remember being super excited.
 But I'm trying to, what was the link?
 What was the reason? What was the passion?
 Because again, we are not Disney nerds.
 like my favorite movies aren't all Disney movies.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But I really, I did want to go to Disney World.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I don't remember why.
  </li><li>I remember going the first day with you
 and you got inside the Magic Kingdom
 and you turned around.
 I think I even took a picture.
  </li><li>I've got it.
 I got the picture I looked at earlier.
 It's anacost.
  </li><li>You squealed.
  </li><li>I'm wearing a yellow hoodie.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I'm like,
  </li><li>Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
 I mean, I was just like,
 yeah, the first time we went,
 obviously it's just us,
 but like you were fascinated by everything.
 And we did all the behind the scenes tours
 and learned about force perspective
 and how do they collect the garbage underground
 and in the magic kingdom.
 So you never see that happen.
 And all this different stuff.
 And I was like, wow, I mean, we got to walk through
 all these tunnels and see people have in-cost.
  </li><li>Yeah, we paid a fortune for the behind the scenes,
 the keys to the kingdom tour.
 And it was eight hours of walking.
  </li><li>Through that? - Yeah.
  </li><li>An eight hour tour,
 which probably fed the nerdy part of me.
  </li><li>Probably, if that didn't feed the nerdy part of you,
 then we have a big problem.
  </li><li>But what was your feeling?
  </li><li>What was your feeling? - But that would happen.
  </li><li>You were?
  </li><li>Well, I mean, I loved how they pointed out
 how even the flooring, the way that the bricks were done
 in different areas and all that,
 'cause like how they thought through every,
 every detail, I loved that.
 Like I loved, yeah, I loved all the intention
 and all the planning and I don't know
 that I would have noticed a lot of it walking around
 without them saying, hey, this is why the brick is brown here
 because this is supposed to be the medieval part
 and there would have been dirt here
 or there would have been slop from windows here.
 And so that's why the brick is done this way.
  </li><li>Because he knows that all the people who are in costume,
 they have their skirts higher.
 Because in those days, there would have been slop.
 And so they were like, no, didn't notice any of that.
 So all the little, no, the attention of the detail.
  </li><li>And you'll never see somebody from the medieval part
 in the space part or whatever.
 Everybody goes underground for everything.
  </li><li>She moves from front to your land and tomorrow land.
 Just not to be pedantic, but like if we're gonna talk about
 specifics, we need to talk about specifics.
  </li><li>Yeah, but you're not a Disney member.
  </li><li>Not totally, that's just being fact clear,
 not Disney no.
 Yeah. Yeah. So we went, we had a great time.
 They certainly know how to cater to people on honeymoon, like in terms of,
 you know, every restaurant we went to, they would, you know,
 bring us free dessert or free champagne or whatever.
 And they'd write a happy honeymoon and, you know, it was,
 I would argue that the customer service we experienced wasn't exceptional
 because we were on our honeymoon.
 It was exceptional because that's what Disney does.
 I do think that's true, but I do think they went above and beyond.
 for like I'm just thinking like we went to our first Cirque du Soleil show was on honeymoon and
 when we called in that was like no there's no tick you know no tickets no VIP wait you're on
 honeymoon hang on a second yes we'll get you in these VIP seats or whatever so there was a certain
 amount of that for sure but I also like I don't disagree I think the Disney magic you're talking
 about is you felt special yes and I would say I remember a time one of the other times we went
 back. We had reservations at a restaurant and for whatever reason they cancelled the reservation.
 You know, and I called just to say, "Hey, you know, I thought this dining reservation booked for six
 months. You have to cancel no reason." They gave me the reason over the phone and they said,
 and I explained, "Hey, you know, there's tons of restaurants like you need anywhere. That wasn't
 the problem." But the reason we booked it was for this and this reason and this reason, they were
 like totally understanding. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to create a magical moment for
 for you. And they went out of their way. We weren't on honeymoon or anything. They went
 out of the way to create. They turned a negative into this incredible thing. Now, I think when
 we were on honeymoon, I didn't have the part of me that I have now, which is how to create
 excellent environments. Like that thing has fascinated me, you know, customer service.
 Yeah. Well, I would say you were still fascinated by it then, but maybe you're at the beginning
 of being, because you would notice, you know, great customer service, like when we flew
 places and whatever.
 Yeah.
 But certainly now as people that probably have more responsibility for how something
 operates, there's so much to look around and go, man, they're doing so much really
 well.
 Mm hmm.
 It gives me a headache to think about the logistics of running everything they do as
 as well as they do as consistently as they do.
 Like, I am like, how does this even run?
 'Cause again, like within the small areas
 of responsibility that we have,
 we want people in our orbit to have a great experience,
 whether that's a church, whether that's a school,
 whether that's a emanate, we want the touch point
 that people experience when they come to Grey Centre,
 of course we want them to encounter the Kingdom of God,
 the presence of God, but we want to remove
 as much friction from the experience.
 So how can we make sure that people who show up at Grace Center, whether they're guests or whether they're members at Grace Center,
 how can we make sure that people who are paying to come to the school have an incredible experience and feel honored and feel loved and feel welcomed and feel
 you know, so you're right, the more and more you get involved in that being your heart and value, the more and more you notice when that happens.
 And none of that ever happens accidentally, it's all intention.
 Yeah. And so I think part of my joy being at Disney is if excellence is the
 sum of a tiny thousand, a thousand tiny pieces.
 Yeah, decisions. Yeah.
 You're on the receiving end of that all all the time.
 Yeah.
 But go on about the honeymoon.
 Like what else about the honeymoon?
 Because so initially you were like, why would you?
 You don't mean the other honeymoon things.
 You just mean the other honeymoon.
 No, Disney. Yeah. Yeah.
 But so originally you were skeptical.
 Yes.
 And then you went and I want to do it.
 And it was great because, you know, not to be craft,
 but it's not like you just lie around having sex
 all day on honeymoon.
 You do other things.
 And it was fun to actually go and have fun things
 to do together, you know?
 And then just be able to go back to the hotel.
 But like, you know, just have a fun activity
 rather than I'm just gonna sit on this chair and...
  </li><li>What fun activity we're talking about.
 I mean, like go on rides and all that kind of like,
 I mean, it was fun to like, there's so many different things,
 especially when you have access to all four parks,
 so many different restaurants,
 we could wander around Epcot.
 We could, I mean, we just basically got to have,
 have fun and have sex, but it not be.
 Yeah, like just, I find like when we,
 I love going to the beach for a limited amount of time.
 Uh, and then I get kind of bored.
 Right.
 Does that make sense?
 No opportunity to get bored at Disney.
 There's no opportunity.
 Yeah.
 The other thing, when we went on honeymoon, we stayed on site.
 We've only stayed on site a couple of times because it's so, yeah.
 Get a set of the way.
 It's so expensive.
 Any time you go to Disney, you're setting fire to thousands of dollars.
 Yes.
 Like you just got to be prepared that you were burning through that.
 Save up and be prepared.
 you will spend way more staying on site.
 Way, way more.
 And our honeymoon, we did that.
 We splashed out, we stayed on site and it's got us advantages, to be sure.
 Yeah.
 Um, don't even know where I was going with that.
 Yes, I do.
 And so, you know, you think about Disney and you can think about Disney is just
 like, you know, long lines is in Florida.
 It's hot, you know, you're for kids, right?
 But some of the best restaurants in Florida are at Disney.
 They're not as far as I'm great restaurants.
 some of their hotels are out of the world.
 And so when you stay on site, or actually when you're a guest
 at Disney, you can go to any of the hotels,
 or any of the resorts if you have a reservation.
 And, you know, like we ate one of the top restaurants
 that they have.
 It's like a five diamond restaurant, spectacular
 restaurant, spectacular food.
 And so it wasn't just the park that was amazing.
 It was the whole ambiance, the whole environment,
 the whole restaurant.
 Again, everywhere you go, their whole job is to excel
 at making you feel special and wonderful.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Start of this year, which I don't know if you remember
 2020, do you remember 2020 being the video?
  </li><li>I've roughly, yeah.
  </li><li>Start of this year, I was praying,
 I'm just asking a Lord for wisdom about,
 what do I do this year?
 And the Lord was like,
 "I don't think your only responsibility this year
 is to find joy, like that's it."
 And so I want you to be around the people that bring you joy,
 I want you to do the things that bring you joy,
 and I want you to be environments that bring you joy.
 And when he said that, I thought,
 I feel joy when I'm at Disney.
  </li><li>Yes, you love it.
 there are environments where I walk into where my,
 like I am very affected by physical environments.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And so I thought like at the start of the year,
 Lord, we'd love to go to Disney.
 So we started planning and saving with a goal
 that it would be great.
 And also last year sucked, like our vacation last year,
 we didn't have one, like most people in the world
 and our kids especially,
 and we didn't go outside last year.
 So we were determined our goal this summer
 is to have a great vacation.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And so we planned that and I remember we drove,
 which it wasn't fun, 10 and a half hours,
 two Florida, it wasn't actually that bad.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It was easier on the way back
 'cause we left at 5 a.m. in the morning.
 But I remember we drove the first night,
 we drove on to Disney Springs.
 Disney Springs is a kind of like downtown entertainment area.
 It's basically an outdoor shopping mall.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>The movie theater, there's a bunch of restaurants,
 a bunch of food trucks.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>All beautiful, all manicured, all gorgeous,
 you know, high-end stores.
  </li><li>Yes.
 And so we drive down.
 We've been driving for 10 and a half hours.
 Oh, this is the next season.
 We've got the day off.
 We drive down.
 We have a day off.
 We go to Costco, Publix, pick up some food.
 And that night, we take the kids out.
 And we're driving down.
 And we drive into the parking garage.
 That's right.
 I'm waxing lyrical.
 Not about the rides, not about the hotel.
 Talking about the parking garage.
 Now, what I'm going to explain about the parking garage,
 you will be familiar with,
 you've seen another parking garage.
 So it's not new, it's just executed so brilliantly.
 As you're driving into this parking garage,
 and there's two of them,
 there's the lime and there's the orange,
 you know, multi-story car parks.
 As you drive in, which is all free parking,
 there is a little kiosk to your left,
 a little electronic board
 that has a listing of all the floors of the parking lot
 with the real-time count of the number of spaces.
 Not that new, lots of parts of, you know,
 it's a lot to do that. - Yes, that's pretty normal.
  </li><li>But as you pull in, you realize that as you're driving down
 the kind of the passageways to kind of find your parking spots.
 There's little blue LEDs that are on.
 And if they're on, it means there's a space
 right where this LED is.
 So it's not that you're driving endlessly up and down
 aisles trying to find a space, competing with everybody else.
  </li><li>That's also not that abnormal now.
  </li><li>Not that abnormal, but still,
 just this thing is executed so brilliantly.
 And it's been there for years.
 So you know that when they built these parking lots,
 they were thinking ahead about the people
 who were gonna be arriving, lots of people arriving.
 How can we make the process of parking
 and much nicer experience?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so it took us, I don't know,
 less than two minutes to find a spot.
 You just drive, okay, we're gonna go the second one.
 Okay, perfect.
 That experience alone, I'm just like,
 okay, I just haven't even got out of the car yet.
 And I love that you've already anticipated my need
 and met it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Now I'm thinking, I've not really been around
 lots of people, like what's this gonna be like?
 And they've also thought of that.
 There's only one way in and only one way out.
 And one way in as you go in,
 they're checking everybody for weapons,
 they're checking everybody for your bags.
 It's all done really, really swiftly.
 They've thought about every minutia
 of every part of an experience.
 Other funny thing.
 Do you wanna say anything down?
 Sorry, I'm just talking about--
  </li><li>But I don't know where you're going
 with your other funny thing.
  </li><li>Well, I'm just talking about,
 I haven't even talked about the rides or the experience.
 I'm just, I'm trying to get across the thought
 that these people recognize they're taking thousands
 of dollars from you and they wanna make sure
 that it doesn't feel like robbery,
 you actually go home thinking that was money when it's spent.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>And what you're spending your money on
 is at best mediocre food
 unless you're going to really nice restaurants.
  </li><li>Oh, well, I don't know.
 Like I feel like they've upped their game
 with their, even their walk up restaurants.
 I feel like this is much better.
  </li><li>But in terms of the money that you're spending
 for that food. - Sure, sure, sure, sure.
 Yeah, expensive.
 If you take a left brain inventory of what you did with that money,
 you set it on fire and in return,
 you got to wait in the sunshine, in the burning heat, for hours.
  </li><li>For like two minute ride. - Yeah.
 So how do they make you leave thinking that was great, let's do that again.
  </li><li>Right. - It's all with intention,
 it's all with thought, it's all with care, it's all with honor,
 it's all with the heart of service.
 Their whole goal is to serve you and ensure that you have an incredible experience.
 I'm not trying to over-spiritualize it, but there are kingdom principles at work where they're just like our whole goal is to make sure that you have an incredible experience.
 When we booked, now for those of you who know my views on, you know, masks and COVID, you know, and all that sort of stuff, you must have thought, Jones, you must be mental going to Florida, Florida, which is the state with the highest COVID numbers.
 numbers like what were you thinking of when we booked it? Disney when we booked it, Disney was ensuring that everyone was wearing masks indoors out there doors, regardless of vaccination.
 Yes, and they'd also it's you must they'd up they'd up their their cleanliness. It's one of the most.
 Yeah, places on the planet. Yeah, but they'd.
 And they lowered the park capacities and significantly lowered the park capacities to the point where when we started booking.
 We could not get any dates for months because the park capacity was not full as in full
 But full to what they decided we were gonna limit. Yeah. Yeah, partly reason we went so late in the year was it was just that
 So you get it. Yeah, and so I felt comfortable that like okay everybody a Disney has to wear a mask
 They've lowered the park capacity
 Our kids are used to wearing masks. We've all got our hands on tires. There's okay. This is gonna be great
 we're going to go. While lo and behold, we book our tickets and then the CDC changes the
 rulings that vaccinated people don't need to wear masks. And instantly, Disney's like, okay,
 nobody needs to wear a mask if you're fully vaccinated. But of course, there's no system
 to tell whether people are vaccinated. So it's on the on our system. Yeah, which means
 aha, wa wa wa wa. So I'm like, okay, well, we've already and we actually talk. Do we cancel it?
  </li><li>Can we trust the Lord and we just go?
  </li><li>Yeah, trust the Lord.
 As we are driving down the CDC reverse their decision,
 and within 24 hours, Disney had reversed their decision.
 And so by the time we arrived for the first day of their part,
 they'd instituted that everybody,
 regardless of your vaccination status,
 needed to weigh your masks indoors,
 strongly recommended outdoors.
 And I would say the compliance of that was just almost 100%.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
 So from that, again, every time you walk into a store,
 their staff making sure that you're a mess.
 And again, in the kindest way possible,
 like making sure people wear mess sounds
 like some sort of Gestapo thing.
 But again, they're brilliant at customer service.
 So they're ensuring compliance at all times,
 everyone's having a great experience,
 everyone's having a great time.
 Jump to most noteworthy experiences of this trip for you.
  </li><li>Well, I got to do my favorite ride three times.
 So that was quite exciting.
  </li><li>I don't know what your favorite ride is.
  </li><li>You should do, it's a Pandora ride
 where you get to ride on the dragons.
 Now obviously you're not riding on dragons,
 but you're like in this screen wearing these glasses,
 sitting on this thing that looks like a motorcycle
 that moves along with the video
 so you feel like you're riding a dragon.
 But I love that ride.
 And I got to do it. - First time we went
 on that ride six years ago,
 five years ago? - Yes, yeah.
  </li><li>How long did we queue for that one?
  </li><li>Two and a half hours.
 And this time?
  </li><li>Well, the first time, I think it was a little under an hour.
 And then the second time it was like--
  </li><li>And you have to write it immediately
 because one of our kids bailed
 and I said, "You can be my writer pass with me."
  </li><li>Yeah, then I got to write it again.
 And then the third time we waited like half an hour?
 Yeah, so that, I mean, really this visit,
 the wait times were way less than we've ever experienced them.
 Yeah.
 So that's a huge highlight.
 But I think my biggest thing is going to the Star Wars land.
  </li><li>Paul's right for a second.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Admittedly, and I've stressed this many times,
 we're not Disney nerds.
 Like I don't have Mickey Mouse ties,
 I don't have Mickey Mouse socks,
 I don't know really the history of Disney.
 You know, it's not what we're about.
 It would be safe to say that AJ Jones is absolutely
 a Star Wars nerd.
  </li><li>Yeah, I love Star Wars.
  </li><li>You absolutely love Star Wars.
  </li><li>I love Star Wars.
  </li><li>So you'd heard a lot about Galaxy's Edge,
 described to people, the uninitiated,
 what's Galaxy's Edge?
  </li><li>Well, so they've made basically,
 they've tried to create the look of a Star Wars type planet.
  </li><li>I'm sorry, tried to?
 Are you suggesting that it didn't work?
  </li><li>Well, I forget what they named it.
  </li><li>Bat 2.
  </li><li>Bat 2, so they've made their own planet,
 or the look of their own planet.
 So you basically go through this tunnel
 and come out and you're in Bat 2.
  </li><li>And the sight lines are amazing,
 'cause when you enter the planet,
 when you enter the tunnel to go in, you can't see the exit.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 and all the sound changes as you're walking through.
  </li><li>Yeah, and when you're in Batu,
 you can't see anything that doesn't look like you're in Batu.
 Like it does, there's nothing--
  </li><li>There's no telegraph poles or skyscrapers.
  </li><li>If you look up in the sky, you can't see anything
 that shatters your experience of being in Batu.
  </li><li>So you're totally immersed in a Star Wars land.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>A whole lot of-- - And they've done
 an amazing job of making it feel like you're walking in one of the movies.
 Like, you know, you're on dantuene.
 You know what I mean?
 Like, or you're talking about the refreshments, the, the Coke bottles.
 Oh, yeah.
 So like everything is themed as well.
 So like even the Coke bottles, um, they looked like grenades, you know,
 from the movies.
 Call on it.
 It says what you might imagine Coca-Cola would be in a space alien.
 You can recognize the branding.
  </li><li>Yeah, and even the print on it is like an alien thing.
 So, and all the foods are supposed to be kind of weird foods.
 Like one of the places we ate, which was a docking bay seven.
 Where did we? - Yes.
  </li><li>It was, you know, again, we're walking at, we went twice.
 But mostly because I was one of my favorite meals
 and it was just one of those walk up,
 take it away on a tray, places that wasn't a sit down
 and dine, but-- - Sorry to be in order.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>Let's talk about that. - Yeah.
 Okay, so how do you feed hundreds of people consistently?
 Thousands of people.
 And have a great experience.
 Yeah.
 How do you do that?
 Yeah.
 Another reason I love Disney is the kind of the intersection
 of amazing technology.
 Yes.
 And amazing customer service and amazing entertainment.
 Yeah, so we'd be walking from one ride to another
 and we'd send our order.
 On your iPhone.
 And on your iPhone.
 And then you could, you know, want to do whatever.
 And then it would give you like a window and say,
 Hey, your food's ready now.
  </li><li>And as geolocated as you walk up,
 they would start preparing for it.
 You paid for all contact lists from Apple Pay.
  </li><li>Yeah, and then you go in and they're like,
 go up to window number 11,
 who's window number 11's waiting with your food there.
 And I mean, everything was--
  </li><li>They've done the best to remove friction.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was brilliant.
 And the food was great.
 And we had great food several times,
 which that's not my lasting memory from the previous visits.
 Like from the previous visits because we're gluten free,
 because there's a bunch of foods we avoid.
 Usually I'm like, ugh, I'm gonna have to eat stuff
 I don't wanna eat, I'm gonna feel like garbage,
 but we're at Disney.
 And this time actually we were able to eat really well.
 So I was really happy with that too.
  </li><li>Okay, now, so you're in this land, this area.
  </li><li>That too, yeah.
  </li><li>And so the shops, there's restaurants,
 there's food vendors, and all the cast members,
 Disney's phrase for their staff are in character.
 Not just in costume but in character.
 So I'm wearing a Mickey Mouse hat with Mickey Mouse ears.
 And one of the cast members comes up to me and says,
 we see a lot of guests dressed as mice.
 What is that?
 Or my fast pass had the Epcot Globe.
 And when I showed it to them to access one of the rides,
 they're like, why do you have the Death Star
 on your communications device?
 So they're all in total immersion.
 There's two noteworthy rides there.
  </li><li>Yes.
 Which one do you wanna talk about first?
 Smuggler's Run.
  </li><li>Talk about Smuggler's Run.
  </li><li>So Smuggler's Run, I mean, first of all, this setup,
 even just waiting in the lineup,
 is almost enjoyable.
 There is so much stuff going on
 in terms of looking at the walls, the ceilings,
 they have little robots everywhere.
  </li><li>Just describe what Smuggler's Run is.
 What's-- - Smuggler's Run
 is you are going to fly the Millennium Falcon,
 and bring some smuggled goods basically to the resistance.
 So you're being--
  </li><li>And there's a life-size Millennium Falcon
 that you climb into. - Sitting outside.
  </li><li>Sitting outside.
 And they create the illusion that you're climbing into.
  </li><li>And they create the illusion
 that you're actually climbing into the Millennium Falcon.
  </li><li>Which you literally do 'cause we have a picture
 of us all sitting in the chess table.
  </li><li>Yes, and I have a video
 which we could probably also put in for the members.
 I have a video of when I was not,
 when you were flying, you know, flying.
  </li><li>I don't know how to do it.
  </li><li>I don't know how to do it.
  </li><li>Not as good as I flew it, but it's okay.
 And I was sitting back and I just took a video
 of all the kids, you know, and the reactions
 to flying the Millennium Falcon.
 But you do feel like this, only people in the ship.
  </li><li>There's only five people.
  </li><li>We are flying the ship.
  </li><li>We are in the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>We're legit flying it.
  </li><li>Yeah, shooting lasers.
 And so I mean, it was pretty, both,
 it was just really well done in terms of how immersive it is
 and how the buy-in of the whole thing.
 And all those cast members are members of the Rebel Alliance.
 So they're like, hey, thanks for doing this.
 And whatever, and we're so excited that you're gonna,
 and then if you go to the other one that's new,
 which is the rise of the resistance,
 you go through this whole, yes, you wanna stop?
  </li><li>You know, I'm just saying, like,
 if you're planning on the rise of resistance,
 skip to the next chapter,
 'cause I don't want this to be spoiled,
 a spoiled experience, because it was breathtaking.
  </li><li>It was amazing.
 I'm just those cast members, you know, being--
  </li><li>Let's say, let out for our listeners.
  </li><li>Okay, so what happens?
  </li><li>So what happens is you're on a transport, you know,
 and you're trying to help Ray and the resistance,
 And then the transport gets tractor-beamed onto an Imperial cruiser.
 And then all of a sudden you're there and there are stormtroopers everywhere.
 And, you know, and they're all everybody's in character and, you know,
 calling you rebel scum and ordering you in certain directions and, you know,
 is trying to stare you down and, you know, all this.
 It's, I mean, it's just super fun.
 But you think of it as a ride and it's not an experience.
 There's a ride part of it, but there's so much experience.
 Several ride parts of it.
 Yeah, there's a couple of different times
 when you're in something that's transporting you,
 but it's the experience of the whole thing.
 And at one point, when you come out onto this Imperial cruiser,
 I mean, you feel like I am in one of those massive bays
 from an Imperial cruiser looking out at the Starry Night,
 you know, and there's Thai fighters up on the side
 that are like full Thai, I mean, it's,
 I was just like, oh my gosh.
  </li><li>The scale.
  </li><li>I can, we were trying to figure out
 how big this one room was.
 And I have no idea how many stories high it would have been.
 Five, six stories high, something like that.
 To create this massive, what was one of the hangers,
 you know, that way to have the ships were coming in out of.
 So, yeah, I mean, I loved it.
 I loved that at one point, I think MJ asked you,
 so I don't know if he was afraid
 or what the deal was and you leaned over to say something.
 And, and.
  </li><li>Yeah, we're in line and MJ asked me something,
 whisper something to me and I leaned over to come for him.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And then one of the Imperial officers that comes over
 and what are you talking about?
 And, you know, do you know the location of the base?
 And, you know, and actually holds you and MJ back
 when he lifts the rest of us go.
 And I was just like, dang, it was so fun.
  </li><li>It's like going to see a play and being part of the play.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Gosh, now we sound like other nerds.
  </li><li>Yeah, and then the ride itself was really great too.
 Just super impressive.
 And you go through the legs of an at-at walker.
 And just like, my kids thought it was great,
 but I was like, this is amazing.
 But again, Star Wars is my childhood, you know, is so many great memories attached to it.
 And then the joy continues because Disney Plus has a series on the making of all those rides.
 Yes.
 And then you go and watch that and again, you're struck by the intention.
 And how long it took them to do it?
 And they've done, I mean, it's, it's so impressive.
 Oh, I have a, I have one funny story though from being in.
 Tell us, sorry.
 Bad, bad to.
 So one of the things that Alan and I both commented on and loved like walking around the parks for six days is how
 Multicultural it is like again. We we live in in Franklin and it's it's just really white
 Like we predominantly cajun people walking around right right and and you're from Edinburgh and I'm from Toronto
 We're from much more of a multicultural scenario and so I was just really enjoying seeing
 all different races, all different types of people.
 And I was loving that the kids were--
  </li><li>Immersed in it.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>You were watching beautiful families.
 Of course, it was a global destination.
  </li><li>Oh, yeah.
  </li><li>And so you're watching families
 from, and you're hearing different languages.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You're seeing different skin colors.
 You're seeing lots of, you know, cultures represent.
 It's just so beautiful.
  </li><li>Yeah, amazing, right?
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>And so we were totally enjoying that.
 And I remember at this one point we were walking,
 we'd rocked out of one of the rides.
 And if you had looked around at that moment,
 we would by far have been the minority
 as a white family walking at that moment.
  </li><li>We're surrounded by people of color everywhere.
  </li><li>Everywhere.
  </li><li>And we're the white family.
  </li><li>And loving it, you know?
 And so because we were like, you know, super aware of that
 and really enjoying it, you know, we were like walking like,
 yay.
 And all of a sudden, MJ stops and he points ahead of him
 and he yells really loud, "Look, Daddy, white people!"
  </li><li>Like he's amazed to see why you feet from it.
  </li><li>Right, and we both like put our, like,
 just like looked up and all of a sudden,
 like you're, you're wearing like this,
 people looking at us at Allen looks up to where he's pointing
 and it's at Stormtroopers.
 It's a-- - It's a Stormtrooper display
 of like-- - It's a bunch of Stormtroopers
 walking for bad too. - Walking towards us.
  </li><li>And so Allen goes, "Yes, son, Stormtroopers!"
 At which point you hear like all of these different
 And he's just start howling laughing at like how funny
 slash awkward slash.
 And I was like, he doesn't even know they're called
 stormtroopers. I failed.
 You failed as your parent.
 Yeah, we tried to get our kids to watch Star Wars,
 at least the first three original, you know,
 what they watched one.
 Well, they got bored.
 I think I've watched them all, but yeah.
 But MJ and Tia, they, they pieced out.
 So it's gonna, what I was gonna ask you some of them.
 You told that story.
 What was I gonna ask you?
  </li><li>Did I try the blue juice?
 I didn't.
 They have blue something melt.
  </li><li>I'm hearing, you know, your passion,
 which of course I was right there with you.
 I'm wandering through Galaxy's Edge.
  </li><li>I wanted to get my own personalized lightsaber,
 but I didn't.
  </li><li>Do you know about the Disney hotel experience
 that they've made for Star Wars?
  </li><li>Yeah, it hasn't opened yet, right?
 You just sent it to me?
 And this is why I'm disappointed because I sent it to you
 and you didn't look at it.
 And ask me how I know you didn't look at it
 'cause you didn't come through the bedroom screaming,
 "Babe, we need to book this."
  </li><li>Oh, well, it's only a two day experience
 and we've just got back. - I did look at it.
  </li><li>Okay. - I did look at it.
  </li><li>I did, I know you didn't.
  </li><li>I did. - You haven't grasped
 the concept of it.
  </li><li>I haven't grasped the concept.
  </li><li>Yeah, you looked at a scroll through.
  </li><li>Yeah, I did briefly the cut and it went.
  </li><li>It's rise of the resistance on steroids.
 So it's a two night experience, like you go there
 and it's not like a hotel.
 Of course it is a hotel where you sleep there,
 but the whole hotel is supposed to be a space cruiser.
 There's no windows in the building.
 There are, there's windows in every room,
 but they look out into space just like the one I did.
  </li><li>Right, okay.
  </li><li>And from the moment that you arrive there,
 the whole thing is a themed star or experience
 where you create a story that you live out
 over the next three days, two nights,
 and included it in a transportation and entry
 to Galaxy's Edge and Hollywood Studios.
 So from the time that you park and are taken on,
 the same immersion that you experienced in Galaxy's Edge
 and on the rise of the resistance
 is expanded to 24 hours a day.
  </li><li>This might be a great anniversary idea for January.
  </li><li>Now you're talking.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>'Cause I was looking at it and it's so freaking expensive.
 Like so expensive.
  </li><li>Listen, we'll ditch the kids.
  </li><li>We'll just ditch the kids.
  </li><li>We'll just ditch the kids.
  </li><li>And now it's manageable and doable.
 So what anniversary are we celebrating in January?
  </li><li>Does it even matter?
  </li><li>What number?
  </li><li>I don't know, what's the number gonna be?
 22, five, 17th.
  </li><li>17th, if I look up on Wikipedia, it says 17 is Star Wars.
  </li><li>Star Wars, dude, dude, you're right.
  </li><li>Then I can get my lightsaber.
  </li><li>I don't know whether to be turned on right now.
 (laughing)
 Or like, I just--
  </li><li>Just think about it, just never mind.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Oh, well, 'cause I've got a podcast to talk about.
 So we've talked about the intention,
 we've talked about the excellence.
 Let me talk about, we've been to Disney,
 I counted up five times.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>The kids have been four?
  </li><li>Yes. - Yes.
  </li><li>Well, I'm just only been three,
 'cause he wasn't alive for the other one.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's not his fault.
  </li><li>So we've been to Disney five times in the last 15 years.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Which means we've been there as grown adults on a honeymoon.
 We've been there with a three-year-old and a one-year-old.
  </li><li>That was my least favorite visit.
  </li><li>As grown adults?
  </li><li>No, no, no, with a three-year-old and a one-year-old.
  </li><li>Okay, I was like, I've got that one.
  </li><li>Yeah, I never wanna do that again.
  </li><li>Well, I was gonna talk about, like,
 being at Disney through different stages of life.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>With different ages of kids.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Because what I was gonna say is,
 they've all been different and all been glorious.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Why didn't you like the one with a three-year-old
 and a one-year-old?
  </li><li>Well, again, when you looked back, I guess,
 all but our honeymoon, our honeymoon was in January.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I remember the weather was at 60, 65 degrees,
 I wore sweater the whole time, you wore a T-shirt.
 And it was pretty great, otherwise.
 When we went with Abby being three and Tia being one.
  </li><li>Less than one.
  </li><li>It was, no, she was just past, just past one.
  </li><li>No, you're right, yeah, 'cause you're in July, you're right.
  </li><li>It was so stinking hot.
 I remember one day it was a hundred and four,
 a hundred and six degrees.
 And again, I don't sweat, I overheat and pass out,
 but I don't ever arrive at sweating.
 And I remember, you know, our stroller was black.
 And I remember watching one of the parades
 coming through Hollywood Studios and, you know,
 Abby was totally into it.
 Although you look at her faces like bright red,
 she's soaking wet with sweat.
  </li><li>You're right.
  </li><li>But MJ, or sorry, Sweet Tia was.
  </li><li>One.
 and looking at me like, "Are you doing, what are you doing?
 "Did you bring me here to fry?"
 I mean, 'cause she's not.
  </li><li>Yeah. - She can't.
  </li><li>I have an amazing experience.
  </li><li>Yes. - Tia, like you could have
 just been a Kroger's.
 She didn't have a clue what was going on.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So, but Abby had an amazing experience.
 We then went back five, six years later.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I think what's sweet is watching our kids
 build memories that we can all share as a family.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It's not something we had to want to do every year.
  </li><li>No.
 Day five this year, I was like, yeah, I'm going to be five years.
 Feels about like the, the lifetime.
 Yeah. He said, then we're planning on back in January.
 That's for us though. At all, at all time at Star Wars.
 That's totally different, totally different people. Totally different.
 We're going to have to take a break fairly soon.
 Yeah. No, I, I, I, the next time that we went was way more fun because Tia
 knew what was going on. They all had their little books that they went and got signatures
 from all the princesses and you know all of that that I loved watching them experience
 this place it's literally made for them like yes adults will probably love it and have
 fun but it's made for kids you know and there's so much like wonder to it which I love.
 I think the thing I've loved is watching how they've catered to every age group.
 Yeah, they really have.
 Like going there with a stroller, you would think would be a nightmare.
 And please, honestly, with a stroller, without stroller, I'm so glad I wasn't
 pushing my kids around a stroller.
 But what I'm saying is when we did push a kid around a stroller, they'd thought
 about that.
 Yeah.
 What's life going to be like for people with strollers?
 Right.
 Here's a way we could make it better.
 Yeah, they've thought about everything.
 Oh, you know, all the, all the intention.
 Tell me your highlights of this, this most recent trip.
  </li><li>Batu, of course. - Not true.
  </li><li>Pandora Ride.
 Our dinner, we went for dinner at Tiffens.
 Is that what it was called?
 We had never eaten there before and it was really good.
  </li><li>Well, what we did this,
 we've only stayed on campus twice 'cause like I said,
  </li><li>You can save so much money by staying
 in an Airbnb off campus.
  </li><li>We got an Airbnb, a four bedroom, three bathroom house
 on Airbnb with a pool.
  </li><li>Yes.
 community that was between 10 and 20 minutes from each part, depending on where you were.
 Oh, it was way less than that. It was, it was, it was seven minutes to the sign. Like,
 you know, the, the sign that you drive underneath the big wall Disney sign.
 That's right. Don't make it, don't make it more than it was, but because we made it
 once in six minutes. And I remember it. Um, but we stayed on the actual road that comes
 was right underneath that sign, like we were on the actual road.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And there was an Airbnb house.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You could buy, you could buy, you could rent a three bedroom,
 four bedroom house.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>For half the price of the cheapest accommodation at Disney.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was way less, like,
 'cause we would have had to do family accommodation,
 which would be way more.
  </li><li>Multiple rooms and--
  </li><li>Right, right, right.
 So it was so much less, like probably a quarter
 of what we would have had to do.
  </li><li>No, it was half 'cause I, I, I, I,
  </li><li>Yeah, I pulled up a spreadsheet and I said,
 "Where do you want to spend our money?"
 And so I went through it.
 So what we did is because we were so close,
 we would sometimes just go for the morning
 and then we would come home in the heat of the day,
 the kids would swim in the pool,
 I'd play video games, you'd have an app or read a book.
 We need some food 'cause of the public's right next door,
 we just go buy some groceries.
 And then we'd go back at night.
 And then one day, we felt safe enough to just leave the kids,
 Abby's 14, say, "Abby, do you feel comfortable
 "baby sitting like the kids from the pool,
 put into bed, and mommy's gonna go back out, and we go back out at night, and just the two of us would be on the drug park.
 We had a date, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 That was the day that your game got over it.
 It was, sad day.
 Sad day.
 Favorite park out of the four?
 Animal Kingdom.
 Why Animal Kingdom?
 Pandora.
 Literally because of Pandora.
 Oh yeah.
 And you don't even like the film?
 I don't like the film.
 Avatar, yeah, you don't even care.
 No, it's, I love that ride, but also the Animal Kingdom has way more shade.
 So the rest of them feel very much like a concrete jungle to me.
 Like it feels animal kingdoms feels more spread out.
 There's so many treat like for somebody who I love nature, I like just being out
 nature. It's meeting that need as well in a lot of ways, because there's so much
 just pretty nature around you where the other parks don't have that.
 So I like animal kingdom.
 Um, and then after animal kingdom would I think that really
 F-COT and Hollywood Studios are tied only because Hollywood Studios has better too.
 If it didn't, it would be F-COT because
 food, wine, like the just, I love all the multi-cultural, like,
 we were there at the Food and Wine Festival, where they had little food trucks everywhere,
 and you could just go eat amazing food from all these, like, food vendors.
 Kids were a bit bored at F-COT.
  </li><li>Yeah, Ebbcock was going through a huge renovation,
 that threw me off, so they blocked off huge ways.
 You know, I'm very directionally challenged
 at the best of times, but curiously at Disney or not.
  </li><li>Oh, Chris, could you cut out that little statement
 right there and make it into my ringtone?
  </li><li>I would be so great. - I would be so good
 to argue that I'm not directionally challenged.
  </li><li>Yes, just say one more time.
  </li><li>I am hugely directionally challenged.
 Like, it's not one of my gift.
 And yet at Disney, I pretty much always know where I am.
  </li><li>Oh, sure, okay.
  </li><li>You disagree with that?
  </li><li>Yeah, I disagree.
 There is a couple times where I was like,
 yeah, there was a better way to go there.
  </li><li>Well, I was following the app and the app was smarter than--
  </li><li>Well, anyway, yes.
 So you, what park did you like?
 Oh, app cop because they were under construction.
  </li><li>Yeah, I like I'm a Magic Kingdom person.
  </li><li>Ugh, it's my least favorite.
 'Cause it's packed.
 Like there's always-- - So packed.
  </li><li>No, you're right. - Way more people
 at Magic Kingdom, there's almost no shade.
 And everything is super like,
 everything's super close together
 'cause it's the first park and they, you know.
  </li><li>The other reason I love it is as a shaper, high shaper.
 People who love to plan is a shaper's dream
 because you plan everything before you go.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You plan which part you're going to on which day
 you can make your meal reservations.
  </li><li>Months in advance.
  </li><li>Well now.
  </li><li>Two months, yeah.
  </li><li>But normally six months in advance.
 And the app is amazing.
 The whole experience is seamless.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So every park has a Starbucks.
 That's all that really matters right there.
 Best place to save money or what should you spend money on?
 What and where should you save money at Disney?
 Well, where you could save money is do stuff like we brought a you
 carried a backpack.
 Thank you for doing that because I know it was heavy and you you
 carried it every day.
 We brought frozen capri sun and frozen water bottles that would
 thaw throughout the day.
 So it was always cold and then like little snacks.
 And so because your snack is probably going to be $10 a head.
 Oh, yeah.
 For a person every time you have a snack.
 And like a drink is probably.
 Yeah.
 Five dollars for a drink, like $4 for a water.
 I'm clean to act.
 Like an ice cream sandwich is like $7.
 You know, so so we just were like, OK, where could we, you know, make it more
 about a different thing? Yeah, state off site.
 What about parking?
 Oh, well, so we we the first couple of days we did normal parking.
 And then the last two days or the last three days,
 we paid for the premium parking.
 Preferred parking.
 Preferred parking.
 And why did we pay for preferred parking?
 Because we were coming out late at night
 with children that we'd made walk around
 in the heat for 10 hours.
 And then because Disney isn't running those tram things
 anymore to bring you back to your spot
 because I guess they're down staff
 or they're trying to save money.
 From a stash somewhere else.
 Yeah.
 So you could literally have to walk another mile
 once you get outside the gate.
  </li><li>No, not quite.
  </li><li>It was a good file.
  </li><li>I tracked it.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I remember getting outside of one of the parks
 and I remember saying to AJ,
 "Babe, if we could call an Uber right now
 to pick us up from where we are
 to where our car is parked,
 would you pay $20 for that?"
 And you were like, "Yes."
 So I said, "Tomorrow we'll pay the extra $20
 and get preferred parking."
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause hands down, you're hot, you're tired.
 You've been walking all day.
 You've walked like 10 miles already.
 And the kids, poor sweet.
 I mean, mostly MJ, but like, yeah, tiny legs is just like,
 I mean, to get outside the park and then go,
 yeah, we still have another 10 or 15 minute walk
 to our car was not great for him.
 So yeah, we got preferred parking.
  </li><li>I would spend money on preferred parking.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I would save money on your food.
 Like Disney's got a couple of different dining options.
 Like they've got what they call like, I don't know,
 they classify it as like sit down.
 You're gonna pay a premium for that.
 You gotta balance whether that's worth it
 because you're actually sitting down in air conditioning
 and someone's waiting on you.
  </li><li>That's true.
 The air conditioning part is nice of that.
  </li><li>But they've also got your,
 they call it like, you know, pick up or fast food
 and you get some good ones, just do reviews.
 But bring snacks that'll cut down costs.
 Stay off site.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Bring water bottles 'cause it's expensive.
 No, we never do park bottles.
  </li><li>The longer you stay, the cheaper your ticket works out.
  </li><li>Yeah, so like a four day ticket is more expensive
 than a six day ticket.
  </li><li>Not more expensive.
  </li><li>But it's per day. - But it's per day.
  </li><li>Being a four day address. - Per day.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But everything's been paying for four days
 and paying for six days is negligible.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so that's what we did.
 And that really cut down the pressure
 because we picked two parks to do over two days.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So you could make them shorter days.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And you can go back as many times as you want
 within the same day.
  </li><li>And especially with the preferred parking was great
 'cause you could, for us, we could drive home
 10 minutes away, you know.
  </li><li>Six minutes away.
 Now that you're lying
  </li><li>One of the days, 10 minutes.
  </li><li>This guy's opened and we were soaked.
 And we were waiting to go on rise of the resistance again.
  </li><li>We weren't soaked because we had our rain ponchos
 that we saved from the last time,
 which cost $18 each, so bring your own rain ponchos.
  </li><li>They've now been used for three visits,
 so they always nothing.
 But yeah, we had those, no, but our feet,
 our legs, everything felt like walking in a puddle.
 And so, and the ride went down for something,
 And so they were saying, hey, we were still an hour away
 from our reservation time on it.
 And the ride is now temporary close.
 So we just drove home, changed clothes,
 put on shoes that weren't--
  </li><li>Ace some lunch.
  </li><li>Yeah, Ace so much had a snack.
 I had a little nap, you played games with MJ.
 And then we went back and we were all like much better
 'cause we weren't--
  </li><li>We literally drove home, did all that.
 Drove back, did that one ride, drove home again.
 It didn't feel like a waste.
 We used some wisdom from Brett and Shaley.
 They had had all of their kids wear a bum bag or a fanny pack,
 depending on what part of the world you're from.
 And so we we had in that we had they had their own rain shield thing and
 spare face masks and some hand sanitizers and you know, whatever.
 And then the girls could put their phones in it.
 And then that way you didn't ever have to take them off.
 So on any ride, you're not worrying about,
 my phone's gonna fall out
 or I'm gonna drop my phone or anything like that.
 So that was their idea.
 We did that.
 We borrowed their stuff.
  </li><li>It was also fun going apart with a 14 year old.
  </li><li>Oh, it was great.
  </li><li>Because if she didn't want to ride a ride,
 at one point she went off and just rode on Everest.
 And I feel totally safe letting my kids wander at Disney.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It was the whole thing safe.
 My older kids.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But we also train our younger kids,
 hey if you get lost, get separated.
 Who do you look for, cast member,
 like what do they look like, what do you say?
  </li><li>Right.
 Everybody except MJ's got phones who you can track them with so my friends. Yeah, but it was great. Oh, it's really good
 It's so great. And oh, you know what my favorite thing was from this this trip
 Was it Tia conquered her roller coaster fear?
 Now we need a little bit of a backup here
 We need to back up and talk about trauma. Okay, so here's the deal every Disney trip Alan traumatizes at least one child
 Cut to my kids telling their trauma stories of Disney
 Tia and MJ, no fair to today.
 The most wonderful show is,
 Keeping up with the jump skis.
 Hi, I'm MJ.
 And I'm Tia.
 I work here to tell you about our family tradition of our dad traumatizing each child at Disney.
 And it all started when Abby went on the dinosaur ride,
 because my dad said it was a baby ride.
 He was dead wrong.
 And then he took me on Space Mountain, first roller coaster ever.
 I was six.
 He said it was a baby ride.
 Also dead wrong.
 And then this time, so basically my dad said, "Oh, this is a perfect ride.
 It's all scary, but I think you'll love it.
 It's only three drops.
 Okay, I'll go on it.
 It's six drops."
 I hated it, caming off, crying.
 Yeah.
 If you couldn't tell which red that was, that was Tower of Terror.
 Uh, yeah, funny story.
 Actually, the year that he took me to Disney and I got traumatized, he actually came off
 of it with Abby and was like, "I think Tia would love this."
 We both hated it.
 He's dead wrong when it comes to rides.
 So basically the moral of the story is when it comes to Disney, you can only trust mommy.
 So Tia has that story of being traumatized.
 Which is totally my fault.
 Anyway, we're at the Magic Kingdom and Tia is starting to, she's considering, does she
 want to try Magic Mountain?
 You know, does she?
 Magic Mountain.
 Or what was it called?
 Space Mountain.
 Thank you.
 Okay.
 I always call it Magic Mountain.
 So she's trying to think like, do I, what I mean?
 Because Abby's like, you know, it doesn't even go upside down.
 It doesn't have a loop to loop, whatever.
 And up until like even driving there, Tia's like,
 I'm not doing space mountain.
 I'm not doing space mountain.
 Anyway, Tia and I are walking around,
 we've gone to go get a coffee
 and she said to two of us and we're holding hands.
 And she says, you know, mommy, I wonder if,
 like I might want to do it, 'cause, you know,
 I don't really want to be afraid of things.
 And I said, yeah, it's not good to be afraid.
 You know, like it's not great to be afraid of things.
 And so we talked about that for a little bit.
 And I just said, you know, Tia, you know what?
 If you try it, I don't know if this is great parenting or not,
 if you try it, I'm gonna take you out for a special treat
 because I know you were super scared
 and I just wanna reward being brave.
 But here's the thing, I love you, I'm proud of you.
 Whether you decide to go, I don't care if you ever go
 on a ride again, totally fine.
 But I also want you to know, hey, if you wanna try it,
 I would reward you as well because,
 so I don't know if that's good or bad.
 But anyway, that's what I said.
 And we were talking about that a little bit.
 And I said, you know, whenever I'm afraid on a ride,
 I laugh to remind myself that, you know, I'm not afraid.
  </li><li>Do you really? - Yeah, yeah.
 Yeah.
 So she goes, what do you mean?
 And I said, I go, ha, ha, ha, ha, I'm afraid,
 like to be like, this is a ride, you know?
 So she was like, okay.
 And then we had watched, was it called Luna?
  </li><li>Luca. - Luca.
 And in that, like the character, he keeps saying,
 Salencio Bruno, you know, as his like, when he's afraid.
 And so we came up with, ha ha ha,
 Salencio Bruno, you know, as like our,
 yeah, we're not afraid, kind of thing.
 Anyway, so she tried it and, you know,
 I sat in front of her and just anytime it did,
 I mean, it is a fast roller coaster.
  </li><li>In the dark.
  </li><li>But when I'd hear, you know, at one point I heard it go,
 mummy and I was like, ha ha ha, so let's do Bruno.
 And so she just starts like yelling that on the right.
 I'm sure the people behind us, you know, whatever.
 Um, but she came up and she actually wanted to do it again.
 And then she started wanting to do all the rides, um, which is great
 because the last trip she wouldn't do any.
 Um, so that was fantastic.
 But then this, this year you decided to traumatize MJ.
 Well, again, I don't want to get into defense here, but yes,
 at times I forget what might be terrifying to small children.
 And in my enthusiasm-- - It was terrifying to me.
  </li><li>I can't do much about that.
  </li><li>Oh, okay.
 It's called Tower of Terror for a reason.
 And you guys, both you and Abby were like,
 "No, it's so, it's not really hardly drops at all."
 And there's like me, there's no big drop.
 I mean, they're not big drops.
  </li><li>So here's me as a mom, you know, that's his experience,
 but I'm listening to him sitting the row behind him.
 I've got Tia's hand and we're doing ha ha ha,
 hoss, lanceo, Bruno, but I can hear him
 bawling his eyes out on the ride.
 And I was like, no, we've done it again.
 And we got off the ride and Tia's quick response was,
 well, MJ, it was your turn to get traumatized.
 So yeah, it's now each of us have had
 a trauma experience at Disney.
 So I think we've been talking a lot about Disney.
 Is there anything else you want to add
 that we haven't thought about?
  </li><li>Yes, I mean, my only thought was it's not really worth it.
 I think when the kids are under three.
 Like, I do think that they look around and they see,
 I don't think that they remember that much.
 It's a lot of money to spend when they're not gonna have
 like, you know, an understanding of what they're seeing.
 So, yeah, I mean, over three, Abby still remembers going
 when she was three and she remembers getting
 Winnie the Pooh Signature and all that kind of stuff.
 Tia has no recollection whatsoever.
  </li><li>I'm actually amazed about what stood out to the kids.
 Like as we would walk around the park
 and our kids now would reminisce on the things
 that they had seen, I'm amazed what stood out to them.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And yeah, it's an expensive way to build beautiful memories.
  </li><li>Yes, it's perfect, it was so fun.
  </li><li>Well, there's our, I was gonna say quick summary,
 but it's not quick.
  </li><li>Disney, yeah. - They're bar me rendering
 Disney rambles.
 There's lots of great websites, lots of great blogs.
 If you do want to go to Disney, I would just consult them.
 I've got, that's how we kind of planned our trips.
 We're happy to nerd out and talk about Disney.
