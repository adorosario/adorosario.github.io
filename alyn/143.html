<p> I'll live in AJ's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 All up, a jam, a boy.<br/>
 Are we speaking Spanish tonight?<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Well, we did have tamales.<br/>
 We did.<br/>
 And I can say a few things in Spanish.
 Let me hear what you can say in Spanish.
 OK, I can say,<br/>
 Unis Papa's Freitas Por favor.<br/>
 That's one border French fries, please.
 OK, that'll get us far.<br/>
 You sat in Honduras.<br/>
 That was it.<br/>
 That's how you reached.<br/>
 Well, I also know,<br/>
 Una's survey is a por favor,<br/>
 but that wasn't from why we have.<br/>
 That's like one beer, please,<br/>
 which is funny that I know that since I did test beer,
 but I can order one.<br/>
 So we're good for beer and french fries.
 Beer and french fries.<br/>
 We will not starve or get dehydrated.<br/>
 (laughs)<br/>
 That's pretty much it.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 Wait, Mosfuego.<br/>
 Yeah, more fire.<br/>
 More fire.<br/>
 I know that, that's the only thing I remember.
 We probably know how to say, "Come Holy Spirit and fire and more Lord in about 20 different languages, but we don't know anything else."
 That's true.<br/>
 That's true.<br/>
 And I love you.<br/>
 Yeah, Alsqaddai.<br/>
 Meena rakistan sinuwa.<br/>
 Yeah, Alsqaddai.<br/>
 There we go.<br/>
 That's for international crowd.<br/>
 Hope you've enjoyed this week's episode of "Keeping Up with the Joneses."
 Good night.<br/>
 baby what a week yes we have a totally different life when the school is out yes we do it's still busy but it's just different things but it's different kind of busy isn't it yes I just more relaxed and busy.
 I just realize when we're not teaching we're meeting yes we do tons more meetings but then it also means we can meet with the people that we've been trying to meet with for the last couple months it hasn't worked out.
 Well, it also allows us to do the other parts of our job.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Tricky that.<br/>
 For those of you who don't know, the vast majority of our students from our eight months
 school supernaturally life, actually, I've got to stop saying it's eight months.
 I mean, the school is only in session for eight months, but we have two years.
 Yes.<br/>
 So we've got first and second year students around the world right now and outreach.
 Students, we'd love you.<br/>
 We love watching what's going on.<br/>
 We're getting texts from the church leaders that you're visiting, saying you're doing
 amazing jobs, so well done on doing that.
 Yeah.<br/>
 away, we've got nobody to teach, which gives us a completely different schedule.
 Well, nobody to teach on the school, we still have emanate.
 Right. You spoke at emanate this week.
 I did.<br/>
 What did you speak on again?<br/>
 I spoke on experience.<br/>
 There we go.<br/>
 And then you did a ton of prophetic ministry.
 I did.<br/>
 I love when you prophesy.<br/>
 Thanks.<br/>
 I think we need to challenge ourselves.
 I'm like so lazy.<br/>
 I haven't prophesied in forever.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 I think I've.<br/>
 I don't want to say I've made a promise to myself, but I potentially
 have made a promise to myself that I'm going to prophesy every time I speak.
 Way to go commitment, girl.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 I potentially made a promise.<br/>
 It's so late a night that I really can't remember what I wrote down, but I'll go back and look.
 Did I tell you the Lord came to him in the dream?
 No, Lord came to him in the dream and I made a covenant with him.
 He said you should buy me a Breville toaster.
 No, but I woke up and I just thought, Lord, that's so sneaky.
 Like I made a covenant with you while I was asleep.
 Well, he is.<br/>
 Now I'm bound to it.<br/>
 He is Jehovah Sneaky.<br/>
 I mean, I don't mind it.<br/>
 It's a covenant I would have loved to have made anyway.
 I'm presumably just been kind of tracking my feet on it.
 So what was it?<br/>
 Oh, I can't trust between me and the Lord.
 You mean you, the Lord, me and our couple of thousand love listeners.
 This doesn't make it feel special.<br/>
 I guess I can understand that.<br/>
 But anyway, I thought it was so funny.
 I was just like, wow, Jehovah Sneaky at work.
 I have paint on my fingers and I can't open my phone.
</p><ul>
  <li>Talk about your latest DIY project.
  </li><li>Oh, I am painting the backs wash tiles.
  </li><li>And why are you doing that?
  </li><li>Because they're hideous.
 Maybe a software saying is that not your choice.
  </li><li>I don't enjoy them.
 I don't like them at all.
  </li><li>No you don't.
  </li><li>Idious.
 Oh yeah, unhidious, just not nice.
  </li><li>And you, I think I love about you babe,
 is you are not limited by fear when it comes to doing things around the house.
 Thank you. That's what Pinterest is for.
 And by golly, you are the Pinterest queen.
 I am. I can Pinterest and YouTube anything.
 And I figure if the average Joe can do it,
 I am the average Joe and therefore I can do it.
 So I just do a lot of research.
 I read a whole bunch of different people's blogs and see if everybody's saying
 same thing if you know make sure that the one that I've sort of selected to follow is similar
 to a whole bunch of other ones and then I just go for it. Am I right in thinking that right now
 I'm getting high on the fume from oil base paint? You're absolutely correct that we are getting
 very high. That stuff stinks. It's horrible. I wouldn't say it's horrible. The smell is pretty
 intense. But yeah. And it's oil base so that you can wash it off because it's back splash.
 So do you want to talk about it?
 Well, our backsplash was beige, which I don't love.
 And I really want to paint our cabinets and stuff.
 But what we're trying is painting the backsplash white
 and potentially painting the kitchen
 and seeing if that lightens up the kitchen enough
 that I don't have to paint all of the cabinets,
 which would be an enormous job.
 Because how many cabinets do you have?
 Oh, I don't know. 30 something.
 There's tons of them.
 Yeah. That does not look like a fun job.
 No, and I'll do it if you know nothing else works, but let's try this mode and see if that light ends up the kitchen and makes it nice enough.
 What what I mean while you're fearless.
 Would it be fair to say that the last thing that you take into consideration is the pace of your life.
 Yes, it's true that your influence or takes over like I could totally do this.
 I could totally do this before Monday and I have to step in with.
 No, I didn't think I was going to get it done before Monday.
 I was using hyperbole.
 Oh, okay.
 I'm saying generally speaking, you're not the best at realizing the other responsibilities
 that may get in the way of finishing the task.
 That's true.
 But that is what electrical tape is for.
 You can just tape those little guys down to the couch,
 put some cheese straws in their mouth, and put on a Disney film and get your work done.
 Can you imagine?
 Please don't call child services.
 I was more referring to me.
 I just get neglected.
 I'm like a DIY widower.
 You are.
 All right.
 What else do we do this week?
 Literally it was still meetings, which was great, but not very interested.
 So I quote, we did see Beauty and the Beast.
 We did in IMAX 3D.
 Yes, I'm not sure you need to see in 3D.
 Well, my new rule is if I can't see an IMAX, I don't want to watch it.
 Why?
 Because going to the movies is a gamble.
 Because you're never sure who's going to end up in the movie theater behind you.
 Are they going to talk?
 Is the person in front of you going to use your cell phone?
 Um, are they going to be really noisy eaters?
 So if I'm going to endure actually leaving my house to be in public,
 I actually wanted to be better than staying home and watching it.
 You sound like a hermit.
 I'm going to endure actually.
 You know, it's like, you know what I'm like.
 Yes, I do.
 And in movies, well, but big D would be good.
 Sure.
 Without the 3D.
 Yeah.
 I'll be fine with that. But again, if I'm going to watch something in 3D, I'd rather
 see an IMAX 3D because the 3D tends to be better than non-IMAX 3D.
 I'm not suggesting 3D. I'm suggesting just the big D, just the big screen with the big
 sound, but nothing popping out of the screen at you, which becomes annoying. Yes. I think
 it would be fine.
 What did you think of Beauty and the Beast?
 I really liked it. I thought they did a great job of sort of sticking to the original film.
 Were you moved by it?
 No. I mean, no.
 I was you were I loved it.
 Oh, I love to be our guest.
 So I thought they did a great reproduction of that.
 Yeah, they did.
 It was really a long reproduction of it.
 That's not felt really long to me.
 Yeah.
 One of the reasons we went to see it was we were so excited.
 Our kids love Beauty and the Beast.
 MJ's favorite line is I say we kill the beast, which he killed the beast,
 which he repeats a lot while out in public with no context.
 Just a little alarming.
 four-year-old stands up with an imaginary pitchfork in his hand.
 I say we kill the beast.
 We're like, OK, MJ.
 So we were excited about taking our kids, but then news came out that Beauty and the Beast
 contains Disney's first openly gay character.
 And we were like, how of her is that going to be?
 But we went to see it, I don't think, or there's literally two scenes in a blink of an eye that
 are a nod to LeFou's homosexuality.
 Oh, I don't think it was LeFou.
 I think it was the other guy that they were trying to nod towards.
 is literally the food.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>So that's what I mean.
  </li><li>There's the guy that ends up dressed up.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>That's not LeFou.
  </li><li>No, it isn't.
  </li><li>He seems excited about that.
  </li><li>But he's the person that LeFou ends up dancing with
 at the end.
  </li><li>Right, for a split second.
  </li><li>For a split second.
 What I mean is our kids would not have the awareness
 that that is a homosexual presented in cinematic narrative.
  </li><li>Yes, very unlikely.
  </li><li>Right.
 But I still think they probably can't see it because of the wolves.
  </li><li>Right, it was a little, yeah.
 Yeah, we went to see it to see would our kids manage it?
 What was it?
 Was it PG or PG-13?
 I can't even remember, but yeah,
 it's a little bit too traumatic for our kids.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I think it would probably be fun.
  </li><li>Happy would probably be okay,
 although she'd probably be a little bit freaked out at the wolves,
 but there's both T&amp;MJ.
 It would be Nightmare City if we took them to that.
  </li><li>So anyway, loved the movie, really good.
 And then this morning we had brother Yoon,
 who most of you would know as the heavenly man
 from the book, The Heavenly Man, speaking at Grace.
 And it was his third visit at Grace and Mary.
  </li><li>Yes, yeah.
  </li><li>He's lovely.
  </li><li>He said the next time he comes,
 he's gonna bring his wife.
  </li><li>Oh, wonderful.
  </li><li>Which is lovely.
  </li><li>Who just got completely healed by the way.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It's Lupus.
  </li><li>Did they share the testimony?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, amazing.
  </li><li>It was really good this morning.
 It was really neat to hear all the things
 that they're doing.
 And of course it's always fun when you have to cut the feet
 at some point, 'cause you know you're gonna hear all this stuff
 that's not supposed to get out there, so it's kinda cool.
  </li><li>All right, I don't think we've ever done a follow-up before,
 but on last week's episode on backsliding,
 I was asking people for their input or their perspectives,
 and I wanna thank everybody who wrote in.
 We had a bunch of you write in,
 contact us via our website or via email or on Twitter,
 and loved reading all of the emails that came in.
 And it sounds like, babe,
 that we covered most of the bases for backsliding.
 Everybody who wrote in tended to share their experience of when they had backslided.
 I had some people who were in the midst of backsliding and were like, "How ironic that I hardly ever
 listened to a podcast about God these days, but I just happened to look at yours and it was on backsliding."
 And so it hit me right where I was at. And these people shared there feeling so anyway,
 I just wanted to say thank you to everybody who wrote in. We really appreciated the time it took
 for you to contact us and we read every email. Yeah, thank you so much.
 So our main topic for this week, babe, is obedience.
 From backsliding to obedience in seven days.
 Didn't even think of that.
 Right.
 Talk to me about why you want to talk about obedience tonight.
 I want to talk about it because, of course, we were listening to brother Yoon this morning.
 And he has an enormous amount of incredible stories and has been through incredible things.
 If you haven't read The Heavenly Man the Book, I highly recommend it.
 Such a good book.
 So anyway, he was, you know, sharing and they're doing incredible things with back to Jerusalem,
 which is their ministry. And at the, you know, you can listen to someone like that and you can go
 and certainly they're not putting it on anybody like, hey, you're not doing enough.
 But I'm sure the enemy would love you to think that like, oh, these people are real Christians
 and you suck. Right. It's like when you listen to Heidi Baker or, you know, any of the heroes of
 the faith, you're just like, am I even saved?
  </li><li>Right, right.
 And so, you know, Jeff sort of said at the end,
 hey guys, you know, it's amazing what they're doing.
 It's absolutely amazing.
 And they're being obedient to their call.
 And actually you being obedient to your call
 is you doing what you're supposed to be doing.
  </li><li>Right, that's the amazing thing about the kingdom
 that pays the same.
  </li><li>Right, exactly.
  </li><li>Right, it really doesn't matter.
 If the Lord has called you to be a stay at home mom,
 you get just as much credit for being faithful and obedient to him as brother Yoon does,
 right? Or a missionary flying into, you know, Afghanistan or whatever. Right.
 There's no difference between the spiritual and the secular so long as you're walking
 on obedience to God. Right. You know, one of the things that I was sort of pondering earlier was,
 how do you know, like, if you don't know what you're called to do, how do you know how do you know
 know what to be obedient to, basically. And my thought was, I think you just be obedient to
 whatever the everyday things are that God's bringing across your path. I think you demonstrate
 your ability to be obedient by obeying in the small things. Like when the Lord highlights
 somebody to you and go and have the conversation with them or when the Lord asks you to give to
 something, you give to something. The different things that the Lord asks you to do when you're
 obedient in those things, then I think that the Lord knows you're going to start being
 obedient in the bigger things too.
 Right.
 There's a ton of stuff in Scripture that we don't need fresh revelation for that we could
 be obedient to.
 Right.
 Right.
 Do you know what I mean?
 I remember when I lived in Scotland, I'd still have some great friends, but in the
 various seasons of my life, I was in an accountable relationship with these guys.
 One of the questions I'd be asked every single week was, "Have you been faithful to the
 the mandate of your calling, which is a great question. Have you fulfilled the mandates
 of your calling? Have you done what you're called to do? Initially, when I was asked
 that question, I was like, "I'm not even sure what I'm called to do." I was like, "Oh,
 well, I'm not sure what I'm called to do, but I know what I'm doing, and I'm being a
 school teacher. Have I been faithfully administering my role as a school teacher? Have I actually
 got my assignments back to my students on time? Have I filled in school reports? Have I done
 lesson plans. Have I been faithful in doing this? Have I been faithful in paying my taxes?
 Have I been a faithful son? Have I been a faithful sibling? You know, just running through those
 things. I wasn't married at the time, so I couldn't talk about have I fulfilled my
 mandates as a husband and as a father. It's such a great question because often we're
 waiting for something big to happen before we're obedient rather than delighting in the
 details.
 Yeah, I think that's really good.
 I think when you do have that track record, I don't know that it gets easier to be obedient
 and the big things, but it's maybe you're faster to get there.
 I think when you build up this little track record, don't you?
 You build up muscle memory.
 And you've probably learned what it's like to be disobedient and you've experienced the
 fallout of that.
 you've learned the pleasure of obeying God in the small things.
 Yeah.
 And the faithfulness of that.
 And what it produces.
 I remember when the Lord started teaching me about fasting.
 And it's so funny because it was run the same time as asking the Lord to hear his voice.
 So here I am desperate to hear God's voice.
 And the only thing he says to me is fast.
 And it was, you know, in hindsight, I realized that the Lord was like, wait, why
 aren't you satisfied with hearing my voice?
 You've asked me to speak to it.
 And now I have.
 And you don't seem thrilled with it.
 And like, oh, oh, oh.
 And for me, it was this whole purification thing of like, why do I want to hear his voice?
 Like, what is that unto?
 Am I just wanting to be an Uber profit or a Mashi interested in cultivating intimacy?
 Anyway, I was in the season of all I did was fast.
 And I was like, what is this unto?
 And that's the important thing with obedience is we think it's going to be easier to obey
 when we know what is unto.
 And maybe it is.
 I don't know.
 but I, there's such, there's such a reward for trusting and obeying God when you don't know where
 it's going. Yeah. And I would say in the big things, most of the time you don't know where it's
 going. Oh, no clue at all. Yeah. You may, you may think you do though. I mean, I can think of
 times when I probably thought I knew where it was going, but I really didn't have a clue now that
 I look back. But that's the folly of leaning on our own understanding, isn't it? Yeah. Like all of
 your prophetic words are easier to understand in hindsight than they are foresight. Yeah. Like how
 How many of us have got a prophetic word and we're like,
 "Oh, I totally know what that means."
 And then you're like, "Oh."
  </li><li>Oh, it didn't mean that at all.
  </li><li>It didn't mean that at all.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You've probably no doubt read Gary Chapman's book,
 The Five Love Languages, that we all speak love languages.
 And the funny thing is God's flute and all of them.
 So you could easily say that God's love languages
 words of affirmation, 'cause he loves worship.
 So you could easily say that the Lord's love language
 is quality time, 'cause he loves spending time with us.
 But I love thinking about God's love language is obedience acts of service.
 Because Jesus said it, you know, if you love God, then you will obey his commands.
 Yeah.
 And the thing I've learned over the years is that actually obedience is really easy
 because it's actually what your heart wants to do.
 Yeah.
 In your heart of hearts, you do want life and life abundant.
 And the key to that is following Jesus, which is inherently wrapped up with obedience, you know, following his way.
 And not our way. And at the point of salvation, actually, we got a new heart.
 We got a new spirit. We've got experienced this new birth, this regeneration.
 And somewhere along the lines, if we think obedience is hard, we've been lied to.
 Yeah. And in my experience, growing with God, I love being obedient to God.
 I find tremendous delight in obeying God.
 Do you ever have those thoughts?
 You were like, I wonder if I'm being set out by saying this out loud.
 I don't know.
 I wonder if the law was like, is that so?
  </li><li>No, 'cause he's kind.
  </li><li>He is kind, he is kind, but he is Jehovah-Sneaky.
  </li><li>He is.
  </li><li>I had to covenant with him while I was asleep.
  </li><li>I'm still, I still wanna know what that is.
  </li><li>Oh, I bet you too.
 You're a prophet, you just asked the Lord.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Go on.
  </li><li>Babe, what about that verse about
 to bait is better than sacrifice?
 My thought about that?
  </li><li>Yep.
 that often I think we'd rather do the sacrifice because we kind of like the little rituals
 and then we could just return to living however it is that we want.
 Ooh, that's cold, baby.
 But it's kind of true.
 Like sometimes we're like, oh, yeah, I'll fast for a day or I'll fast for three days
 or I'll do whatever.
 And I'm literally never like, okay, I'll fast for three days.
 That thought never enters my head.
 We like the little, we like the little rituals, but we don't like the regular lifestyle obedience
 as much.
 It's a little like what happens to your heart when you tithe.
 So when I started titheing, I was like, there's your 10%,
 don't bother me with the other 90s.
 The other 90s, mine, mine.
 And when God would come and say,
 hey, I would love you to give this initially,
 I'd be like, what?
  </li><li>I gave you your 10%.
  </li><li>And I wonder if sacrifices like that mental checking in
 and going, see, I've done this.
 Therefore I can now, I'll obey you on the big things,
 but the small things I don't think you care about,
 I'll just get on with my life.
  </li><li>Right.
 steward at my own way. But again, that comes back to that lie. You really do want to obey God.
 There's such life and such joy in obeying God. But I mean, I just think even last year,
 we were we were a elevation church in North Carolina. And the pastor who was preaching there,
 he just said delayed obedience is disobedience. And there were some things that I had not
 been actioning, you know, for all my talk about, oh, I love obeying God. You know, in this thing,
 I had been dragging my feet, not out of rebellion, but I think out of fear.
 And so I just made up my mind, okay, God, I've been holding back obedience, thinking I'm being
 prudent and waiting for confirmations, but I was just chicken, basically. Talk to me about,
 I love the story that you tell about you getting in, because everyone who knows you today knows
 you as a public speaker, knows you as an author, listens to you as a podcast host. You're very,
 very adept at speaking to people in large groups, one on one, etc, etc. So people know you as this
 public speaker, this high influencer. So they might find out that your story into that was one of
 absolute obedience, which meant you had to sacrifice fear.
 Yeah, or even just my reputation. I mean, I was, so I started speaking just because my
 Youth Pastor asked me to, right?
 And I would shake horribly and vomit before every time I spoke.
 And typically I cried all the way through it.
 And just because you didn't want to do it.
 Just because I was terrified.
 You hated public speaking.
 Yes.
 But it just seemed like every time I thought I had proven to everyone that they
 shouldn't be asking me, somebody else would believe in me to do a little bit better.
 and keep pursuing that with the Lord.
 Didn't John do that behind your back?
 Didn't John send you out on some--
 Yeah, he signed me up for a conference,
 signed me up to speak at a youth conference.
 Without checking with you.
 Yes.
 Sounds like John.
 But he did let me know shortly after.
 Oh, that was nice.
 That was nice.
 But they already had my name and everything.
 Partially, I was like, "Okay, actually,"
 John was like, "H.J., what if this is what you're called to?"
 And I had had all these prophetic words about speaking and all that kind of stuff.
 We'll talk about that, because you just didn't like it.
 You didn't just have one or two.
 You had some over a number of years, some heavy hitter prophets.
 Well, in one year, I had five different major prophets call me out and say,
 "I see you traveling the world and speaking and speaking in stadiums."
 And all this stuff.
 They gave you the same word.
 All of them, yeah.
 And none of that moved your heart closer to obedience.
 No, I thought they were all insane because I was just like,
 out of girl.
 Yeah, I know.
 But the thing is, I was afraid of people.
 So I didn't think that possibly God would be asking me to do something
 that I didn't feel equipped for.
 So that part again, I didn't think that it was possible that God would be asking
 me to do something I didn't feel equipped for.
 I didn't, I didn't know that God would bring the equipping.
 Right.
 I just thought, well, naturally, that's not something I want to do.
 And there's people that do want to do it.
 And so surely they're called to it.
 Um, I didn't realize that he, he qualifies the called, you know, he, he goes ahead and does the equipping.
 And so, um, it was obedience that actually brought me through the equipping stage.
 Cause I just kept saying yes to God, even though it was painful and it wasn't easy for me.
 And I look at you now.
 When did it get easier?
 Well, it got significantly easier when I stopped
 of vomiting every time I had to speak.
 But I mean, probably was after a year or two that it got a little bit easier.
 Fun.
 Yeah.
 But I mean, in the first year or two that I spoke, I only maybe spoke four or five
 times a year.
 So you're not actually getting to do it enough to not be nervous about it.
 So here's our encouragement to everybody who's listening.
 If the Lord has asked you to do something and you haven't done it yet, do it.
 I know it's really complex and deep this week.
 -Tricky. -But seriously, there's so much delight on the other side of obedience.
 -Oh, absolutely. -Especially obedience that requires sacrifice.
 I think about the times that I've moved countries, I guess I've only done it twice.
 -Yeah. -But both times you're leaving your life,
 leaving your whole life, your friendship groups, the quality of life that you know,
 the environment, it's wonderful. And you're being obedient and going,
 I don't even know how this is going to work. And both times that I've done that, I'm just amazed
 at God upgrading everything. And so the reward is well worth the risk. So we want to encourage you,
 if the Lord has been speaking to you about something and you haven't done it,
 take this as the word of the Lord today. Go do it. Go do it. obey the Lord.
 As reading Tozer tonight, a w Tozer, and he said this great line said, when you kill time,
 remember that it has no resurrection. Wow. I do not want to stand before the Lord
 at the end of my days with regret. No, I just, I want to, I want to cross the finish line panting
 from excitement and not exhaustion, but like I have run the race, I have done everything. I have
 been so obsessively compulsive about being obedient to all the little eyes and dotting the eyes and
 crossing the teas. I want to be so intentional with the way I live my life and obedience to Jesus.
 And I think you're fully alive when you're fully obedient. Amen. I totally do too.
 Good. I was one of the things that tried to meet you.
 Thanks, baby.
 Was your whole heart devotion to Jesus.
 Thanks.
 I was attracted by your Scottish accent.
 Where are you really?
 I did really like the accent.
 And now it's basically gone.
 It's totally gone.
 I can't hear it at all.
 And when people stop and ask you if you're from Australia or England.
 And I'm like, OK, he doesn't have any accent at all.
 How you're picking that up.
 I have no idea.
 And no, he's not from either of those two places.
 I know. All right.
 We need to, you know what I need to do?
 What do you need to do?
 Import a bunch of Scottish people.
 Well, that's happening in me.
 Beef up your accent.
 That's true.
 We're getting the most ridiculous Scottish accents coming to styles.
 Oh, yeah.
 We should put them on the podcast just for fun.
 We should.
 Just have an accent challenge.
 All right, this is question.
 Yes.
 For this week, you're going to love this question.
 Oh, hit me with it.
 This is from Jill.
 Yeah.
 Says AJ.
 Yes.
 What kind of kitchen knives do you use? We're looking to upgrade and I'm thinking you probably use the best.
 I do. I do believe I do. They're called WOOSTOFF and I use the icon classic range.
 So the thing with knives is you want to get one that fits your hand really well.
 And the icon classic has a bit of a slope to it, but it's got a good weight to it. And it's just a
 really nice knife and all of the different blades that they have, the actual handle is really nice
 on all of them. So I love it. It's a good heavy knife. You should probably brace gel for the
 reality of those knives though. They're expensive. These are knives you've collected over the years.
 Yeah, I've been collecting the icon classics for the last nine years and I still don't have a full
 set. So birthdays, anniversaries,
 yes, Christmas presents.
 Yes. I'll like save up, you know,
 gift certificates and stuff like that from birthday and Christmas and put them
 together to get one knife. So they're, they're expensive, but they're well worth
 it. They're great knives.
 And you use them all the time.
 Use them all the time. My kids use them.
 I'm teaching them how to use good sharp knives.
 Someone's going to learn to juggle at some point.
 That's right.
 Oh my gosh.
 See, I get mocked.
 for buying light bulbs.
 Nobody ever walks you for buying kitchen knives.
  </li><li>Well, probably most people don't have any idea
 how expensive they are.
 I've had people come over that actually cook
 and they don't mock my knives.
 They're like, "Oh my gosh, these are amazing."
 I'm like, "Oh, I know."
 But they probably also realize how expensive they are.
  </li><li>All right.
 See, we're all nerds.
  </li><li>I'll be able to hand them down to my kids.
 They're great knives.
  </li><li>Are you planning on going somewhere?
 Like that was a--
  </li><li>No, I'm just saying.
 Like knives like that,
 they're like lifetime knives, you know, you can hand them down.
 Okay.
 Perfect.
 All right, Jello, hopefully that's helpful.
 And that's a wrap, folks.
