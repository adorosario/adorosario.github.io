<p> What babe here we are trying out this podcasting work.
 How do you feel.<br/>
 I feel fine.<br/>
 I do feel slightly surreal that I'm sitting at the end of the table from you smiling at
 you while trying to keep my mouth close to a microphone and keep my levels correct.
 Yes, not hit your face off of the microphone.
 So it is the end of the week.<br/>
 How was your week?<br/>
 It was good week.<br/>
 It was a good week.<br/>
 I tend to get to the end of the week and can't remember the week.
 I know last week we graduated all our students so congratulations to all our school supernatural alumni you guys are awesome you did an incredible job.
 What happened this week.<br/>
 I ordered a cleanse and so i've been living towards starting a cleanse tell me about your cleanse which gives me the fear just looking at the box that arrived from Amazon.
 Well it's the same cleanse we did about 10 years ago but then it's an added 21 days after that 8 day cleanse so it's a crazy.
 Colum cleanse and then it does all of the organs and stuff so does go bladders and not that i should have to i suppose it can be leaver skin blood limb.
 Bladder lungs just a huge cleanse parasites the whole bit and why.
 In the love of all its holy would you want to do that yourself.
 I feel sluggish and yucky and i want my energy back and so i figure i'd rather see if there's any little friends like parasites that need to go since we traveled so much for so many years.
 Okay and it should be of no that i am not joining you in the insanity that's a twenty eight day herbal clams.
 You just never know babe later on you might go man i should totally do that you look like you have your energy back then you're gonna do it on your own.
 Yeah i'm not convinced or wild about that idea.
 I guess i can be a regular feature of the podcast i was a j's colon feeling full and update that awesome.
 What else do we do we see lots of people this week i felt very very social.
 I've pretty much can't offer a monkey and with people with friends over for lunch very beautiful and very awesome lylin alson philip's he does have a magnificent beard he does.
 I don't even like beards but his is definitely magnificent as well groomed and there possibly to the most stylish pastors and people get past is just the most people we know very good looking indeed not kids seem to love them.
 And then what else what i try to think of it's mother's day coming up there's a new crow that open next door to us there is a new crow that opened up to us and for some reason we're very excited about that.
 I can get mj there today and he waved everybody like he was royalty is like hi hi hi and then loin kisses very cute mj for those of you don't know is our one and a half year old less you think that we have.
 a care in the community child that you take out.
 That's a nice noise that I into the microphone.
 Talk to me about music. We had a couple of new albums that we listened to non-stop at our time.
 Diamonds by Johnny Swim.<br/>
 Amazing.<br/>
 Yeah, we love that. And then we managed to get a hold of a pre-release copy of August York's
 new album, which I'm also loving. It's quite similar to Johnny Swim.
 They have a new single coming out i think this week come to paris very summery very catchy.
 But the thing is been on non stop in our house has been the new bethal album called you make me brave yes amazing so good is from a women's conference but it's absolutely astonishing.
 Yeah i love it as do our kids absolutely love it.
 We need to know this week.<br/>
 No, but that sounds glorious. Let's try that for next week.
 No, I don't think we've eaten anywhere new.
 I plan for next week, then eat somewhere new and report back.
 If you have any recommendations of places we should try, please.
 I'll be fasting.<br/>
 You got any recommendations of what I can try?
 Please let me know. Me and Aaron earlier are going to dose next week.
 Try the new coffee shop.<br/>
 I don't even is that in Nashville?<br/>
 I think so.<br/>
 I'm just letting him be my coffee guys.
 I don't drink coffee.<br/>
 Well, I want to talk to you babe we're married I want to talk about the whole.
 Holy mother for all that was a j's tummy I'm not sure if I got picked up on a right.
 But the earth moved glorious when it's all about marriage.
 Yes, that's an excellent idea.<br/>
 Yeah, we're married.<br/>
 We are.<br/>
 It's true.<br/>
 How long have we been married?<br/>
 Almost nine and a half years.<br/>
 Almost nine and a half years.<br/>
 years. What do you think the secret to us staying married for nine and a half years has been?
 Well, I remember in YWAM, one of the things that they told us at YWAM was, you don't stay
 married because you're in love, you stay in love because you're married. So I think one of the things
 is that you just choose to deal with your stuff because we said until death to us part and that's
 That's what we meant.<br/>
 So you can either get really mad at each other and be grumpy or you can...
 I remember one time after we had a huge fight.
 I don't know if you remember this because our fight is so rare.
 All seasonists, they are quite rare.<br/>
 But I remember you had stormed out and I was livid and the first day I did was call Jeff
 dollar our pastor and I ran to him about how bad you were and how innocent I was and
 I'm just defenseless and you're the son sort of monster.
 He said, I know.<br/>
 And he said, Alan, he who apologizes first wins.
 So I think that we've found that the quickest way to defuse
 tension is a sincere apology, which is difficult because it's easy to give a, okay,
 I'm sorry, can we have sex now apology?
 But that never works.<br/>
 It's, and so in order to give us a sincere apology, you have to actually get to the
 place where you examine your heart and you work out where I go.
 Do you remember for probably the first couple of years of our marriage?
 What would happen is if we had an argument or a fight, I would go off and complain to God,
 and the interesting thing is God would always take your sight.
 Well, that's because I was virtually perfect in all of these scenarios, isn't it?
 No, you were deluded in that supposed situation.
 But as I was talking to the Lord about it, and I would say, "But Lord, you're always taking
 her sight." He said, "Alan, I don't hold you accountable for her actions. I hold you accountable
 for your actions. So let's ignore what she's done for a second and let's examine what
 you have done or what you have said or how you have felt. And that was a very, very quick
 way to die. And I think probably a healthy marriage involves a fair amount of dying
 on each side. Wouldn't you say?<br/>
 Yeah, we definitely say. Well, it's like, it's, I mean, it's kind of daily dying to
 little things all the way along. I don't think you realize, or I certainly didn't realize
 how selfish a person I was until you actually get married.
 Because all of a sudden you have to consider somebody else and just little things that
 you took for granted, you know, obviously you have to be thinking about somebody else
 all the time and it's work.<br/>
 Was it John and Paul Sandford said that you marriage is designed to grind and not in the
 way I hoped it was?<br/>
 And Verrale, your spouse is uniquely designed to kill the things in you that needs to die
 quickly.<br/>
 Quickly, what would you say is three of the biggest obstacles for us are in marriage?
 I've got number one.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 I'd say both you and I are high shapers.
 We're high planners.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 So without trying to plan, we constantly have a plan.
 We're very strategic.<br/>
 So we often wake up and if we're not careful, we don't include the other person in our plan and then don't like it when our plan doesn't get to go our way.
 Right.<br/>
 I'd say that's number one.<br/>
 Yeah. And I would say number two probably goes with it, which is communication.
 So often we don't even communicate that plan.
 Good.<br/>
 You know, or I feel I have effectively communicated that I would like you to help
 with X, you know, but you didn't hear that as a time crunch scenario or whatever.
 So I just think like, I'm not sure if this is number three or this is kind of
 like a more a two B on your point.<br/>
 The other thing is when the plan changes and you haven't updated me or when the plan changes and I haven't updated you.
 Yeah, neither of us do.<br/>
 One of us is more flexible than the other.
 That's.<br/>
 And we've, I think we're pretty quick to spot that that's what's going on.
 It doesn't make it easier, but it makes it easier and that we know what the problem is and then we can solve.
 Well, it doesn't turn into a fight for us at that point that we can solve it.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Number three, what we're just number three is.
 Um.<br/>
 Gosh, I don't even know.<br/>
 I would probably say, I'm throwing this out here.
 See what you think is which we do less and less of and the kilsters helped us with this,
 which was the whole aspect of keeping score.
 Fairness.<br/>
 Fairness.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Man, fairness and marriage do not go well together.
 No.<br/>
 Because you're your own worst umpire of what's fairness because you're constantly keeping
 score for your own side. Yeah. Which is just a death nail to happiness. Yeah. And when
 you're so busy keeping score of your own side, you actually don't notice anything that your
 spouse is doing. So, yeah, it feeds an ugly thing. What would you say the three best things
 are about our marriage? Please say sex. Please say sex. Sex darling, of course. Never one.
 Yeah, well, it wasn't on top of my speakers,
 but you mentioned it.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 All right, we'll say sex is a given.<br/>
 Top three things about being marriage.
 Kids.<br/>
 I love our kids.<br/>
 They're a product of our marriage.<br/>
 And they're healthy, and they're happy,
 and they're well adjusted.<br/>
 And I think that that's part of the fun of being married
 is getting to love on them and bring them up
 and teach them stuff.<br/>
 Good.<br/>
 I hadn't thought of that.<br/>
 Yes, I agree with everything you said. I'll throw in number two as in having a constant companion,
 which is actually awesome, even for two people who are highly introverted.
 Living with your best friend.<br/>
 Yeah, I love having that. What is your number three?
 For us, I think that we're evenly matched in things that we like, if that makes sense.
 So you like Apple products, so do I.<br/>
 I'm not like holding out for delves.<br/>
 And I, you know, we both can appreciate that you want to actually, if you want to have
 something, you want to have the best of it or the one that you want.
 and so we can say for that whenever without it becoming an issue.
 Does that make sense?
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah, it does.
 I didn't explain that very well.
  </li><li>No, I would say, and I'll throw this out for free.
 I'm not sure where this fits in with our discussion,
 but I would say one of the things that probably helped
 transform our marriage with the revelation
 that we had to find equivalence for each other.
 So what I mean by that is we would go to Williams and Sonoma
 and you would say, "Oh, babe, can I have $25?
 "I really wanna buy this lemon zester."
 And I'd be like, "Don't we already have a lemon zester?"
 And then you would take great pains to explain
 why this lemon zester was better
 than the other lemon zester.
 And I initially had to be like,
 "That's a waste of $25."
 Until I would come to you and say,
 "Babe, can I have $25 to buy this piece of software?"
 And you'd be like, "Well, what does the software do?"
 And I'm like, "It does X, Y, and Z."
 And you're like, "Don't you already have a piece of software
 "that does X, Y, and Z?"
 And then I would take great pains to say
 why this was slightly better.
 And once we realized that we had equivalent passions
 that were disguised in different formats,
 then it began to make sense.
 So suddenly it made sense why you wanted to spend
 so much money on makeup, and it suddenly made sense
 to you why I wanted to spend so much money
 on home networking equipment.
 So I think that's been a winner for us.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Well, and I've definitely benefited from your geekery.
 and I've definitely benefit from your makeup.
 I look much better with the way that's not right.
  </li><li>Why do you focus on the cooking end of things?
  </li><li>Yes.
 Yeah, I have.
  </li><li>What are the else you wanted to say about marriage?
  </li><li>I think, I think, and it's something that in the season
 we're not doing that great act
 'cause of how busy we are,
 but it's important to keep dating even after you're married
 to, you know, to keep pursuit and that kind of stuff.
 So I think that that's, that's one of the things
 that I saw my aunt and uncle do.
 they had a Tuesday night date and they've been married for 40 years and they're still
 having their Tuesday night date and it's kind of a non-negotiable but I think that that's
 how you get through the hard stuff is you keep dating and you keep pursuing.
 Very good. Well, what have we got coming up? More conference. We do have a more conference
 coming up. At the end of May, Memorial Day weekend. Memorial Day weekend, if you happen
 to be in Nashville that weekend. We are running a killer conference at Grey Center. We have
 our dear friend David Campbell all the way from England flying in. Adrian, I will be speaking
 at that. And Chris McLawney is going to be leading worship along with Luke Finch. It's
 like Luke Finch's farewell concert. If you think about it, it's going to be his last
 Sunday at Grey Center. If you go to musthavemore.com, you can pick up tickets and you can register
 there. And then if you're interested in having your life completely transformed, we run a
 school at Grey Center called the School of Supernatural Life. And the deadline for applying
 for this year's school is June 15th. So if you go to greycenter.us/school, you can find
 out all the information about that. One of the things that would be really helpful for
 us, if you go to our website, allenaj.com/ask, there's a form there where you can fill in
 A little quick form and let us know any questions that you'd like us to discuss on the podcast.
 Any questions you want us to answer or discuss?
 But I can't think of anything else.
 I don't want to waste your time.
 So we are out.
 Done.
 All right.
 All right.
 Let's go make out.
 Do you hear that last ladies and gentlemen?
 I know what comes after that.
