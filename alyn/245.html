 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>AJ Jones.
 Over here, sweetheart.
 AJ Jums, come on.
  </li><li>Don't make me laugh, it hurts.
  </li><li>Are you okay today?
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>You look a little spaced, what's going on?
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I just have some pain.
  </li><li>Well, good job, I'm a doctor.
 Let's talk about your pain.
 Where's your pain?
 Are we recording this right now?
 We're totally recording.
 We have started.
 This is the episode.
 My pain is where my ovary used to be.
 Is it like phantom ovary pain?
 I don't know.
 Yeah, maybe.
 No, it's maybe where the flopian tube used to be connected
 or something.
 It's inside somewhere and it hurts.
 I'm so sorry.
 Yeah.
 Is there anything you need?
 A song--
 A song.
 A song would be great.
 Why don't you just sing me a little song?
 Yeah, I'm not sure that would make you or anybody who feels better.
 You offered.
 Yeah, I did.
 I'm sorry.
 I've been switch.
 Yeah.
 Episode 245.
 We're talking about how to build and maintain relationships.
 Yes.
 Really how to build and maintain healthy relationships.
 But the title was already too wordy anyway.
 So I cut that before we jump into that though, weekly catch up.
 How was your week?
 Was good.
 Yeah.
 It was.
 It's really worth letting our audience know that we record kind of like a couple of weeks in advance.
 So yeah, we just had 4th of July.
 By the time this comes out, 4th of July will be a distant memory.
 But yes, it is worth talking about our 4th of July.
 Oh, yeah. Forgot it was the 4th.
 I know it was replete with fireworks.
 Danger, I was going to say, but yes.
 Danger danger danger and adventure.
 Do you want to talk about that?
 Yes, we went over to our friend's house and they're in a county where you're allowed to set off fireworks,
 where we are not.
 Tia's comment is what's about, hey, if we're supposed to live in the land of the free, why can't we set off fireworks in our own property?
 Yeah, we're celebrating Independence Day and Tia was miffed as I was too, that we can set up fireworks in the place that we live.
 So as you say, we have to look up a map and work out where is it legal to set off fireworks?
 Yes.
 And so we got to go and set off fireworks with friends, which was way more fun.
 And we also were gifted with like a whole bunch of fireworks by somebody who wasn't going to use them.
 Hundreds of dollars worth of fireworks.
 Epic like 50 rocket type things.
 But when we pulled into the neighborhood, what were you feeling?
 Oh, it was unbelievable.
 It was like everybody in all of Nashville and Franklin got the idea of going to
 Spring Hill at the same moment to watch fireworks.
 Like it, it looked like every two or three lawns.
 There was a huge set of shut down streets in the cul-de-sacs where they'd built their own launch pads.
 Yeah.
 And I guess all the neighborhood families pulled their money together because we'd drive by and they would just be boxes like waste high of fireworks.
 Yeah.
 And then based on our experience of being in the backyard of our friend's house and listening to the.
 It was unbelievable. I'd never experienced anything like it.
 It was spectacular.
 You could look at any direction and see a fireworks show.
 And it was so loud. Never mind the one we were doing.
 Yeah.
 And they would be raining debris from other people. Yes.
 You know fireworks. Yeah. We were getting hit by flying cardboard from other people's, not even our own show.
 Because we were firing them away from us, so I guess. Yeah. You know, it's...
 It was our... it technically wasn't our first 4th of July. No. As being citizens. Yeah.
 But it was the one that counted because last year you were in bed with Mono.
 Last year I was in bed with Mono. I remember who I felt dreadful.
 And I remember I came over to the guest room window, open the window and look down at you guys.
 Well, you ate watermelons and things. And then I went back to bed and just fell asleep.
 That was that was the extent of fireworks. No, but there was something beautiful about watching
 all these fireworks. And bear in mind, I've been American for like a year and a bit,
 but there was something very, I don't know if it was nostalgic or patriotic, but I,
 I felt really good about setting things on fire and blowing them up in the air. It just was a
 was a beautiful night and I loved it.
  </li><li>I realized you still have your firework prance.
  </li><li>I was shocked that you didn't address that on the night
 because I was so conscious of my firework france.
  </li><li>I think they were still there and Lindsay was like,
 look at the way they sort of like skip and run away.
 And I was like, yes, that's the firework prance,
 which I first saw in Scotland on Guy Fox night.
  </li><li>Yes. - Like, I don't even know
 how many years ago now, 15, 16 years ago,
 when Glenn and Anna and you and I went out
 into some field on Guy Box,
 like to set off fireworks, do you remember?
  </li><li>I do, the other thing that made the prancing worse
 was I was in flip flops, which I thought,
 this is the worst footwear to ever set fire
 to an explosive device and then try and run away.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And also the fuses looked so short.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I didn't count on the fact that it was an internal fuse
 as well, but yes, I thought it odd that you didn't comment
 on the prance on the night.
 So I'm glad it went below.
  </li><li>Well, I saved it for the podcast
 'cause you like to make little comments
 on the podcast that you saved.
 So here it is, the Prance, the Firework Prance.
  </li><li>And we ate spectacularly.
  </li><li>Oh, so good.
 Yeah, we had just a definitely not keto,
 not anything day, just American food.
  </li><li>It was very patriotic.
 We had those, what do we have?
 We had burgers?
  </li><li>Hot dogs.
 Well, I'm thinking of the burger stack.
 I had burger with smoked brisket,
 with smoked turkey, with pimento cheese,
 with fire roasted jalapenos.
 And then was there something else on top of it as well?
 It was maybe the most delicious thing I've eaten all year.
 Yes, I didn't have that.
 But we did have, we had buns,
 which we don't normally eat buns.
  </li><li>Burish buns, yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, and we had hot dogs,
 which I like hot dogs every once in a while.
 Like once a year is good.
  </li><li>Chris was telling me this morning
 about a hot dog place at the Franklin Farmers Market
 that we need to go to.
  </li><li>Oh.
 Okay.
  </li><li>So I'm excited to try that.
 Chicago dogs, is that what it is?
 Okay, so that could be a Saturday morning escapade.
  </li><li>I want to go to the farmers market anyway
 'cause there's a place there for buying hummus
 that is like Israeli hummus.
  </li><li>I wanna go to the Franklin Farmers Market
 'cause Lucy Rizzo's breakfast sandwiches
 might be the greatest thing in all over the city.
  </li><li>That's true too.
 All right, well, I guess we know what we're doing, Sarah.
 No one, Chris and I were talking to her list and he's like,
 do you ever got the Franklin's farm market?
 I said, I haven't been in years, but apparently that's going to be rectified.
 Yes, we should fix that.
 OK, what else happened this week?
 You were out of bed.
 You went back to work.
 Went back to work.
 I'm still feeling super tired.
 I realize, you know, just.
 That makes sense.
 My first day back at work was Tuesday and I went to bed at 7 p.m.
 Like in just, I mean, I still watch TV, we watch TV together and whatever,
 but I just needed to be in bed lying down and done for the day at seven, which I just realized,
 okay, I'm still recovering some.
 I finished the boundaries masterclass.
 You did?
 Ah, it's so much fun. Thank you to everybody who did the boundaries summer school and those
 who did the boundaries masterclass. You can tell that I don't have the American part of my
 counters which done because I managed to schedule meetings both for Father's Day and for Fourth of
 of July, but it all worked out.
 So if you don't know what we're talking about,
 the last five weeks, well, the last seven weeks,
 I did a boundaries master class.
 The first five weeks I did the boundaries.
 Summer school is where people would go through
 our boundaries course.
 If you missed the summer school
 and you missed the master class,
 but you're interested in boundaries,
 the video course, the boundaries course,
 you can do whenever you want.
 It's available all the time.
 And these students would go through the boundaries class,
 then they would meet with me on a live call.
 And I just had so much gladness being with our students.
 Like what was it like every day?
  </li><li>I mean, I could, I knew as soon as you hung up,
 you would come into whatever room that I was in and be like,
 babe, I love that it was so much fun, so much life.
  </li><li>I felt like buddy the elf, I mean love,
 I mean love, I mean love, I mean don't care.
  </li><li>Yeah, I really enjoyed it.
 I had a great time.
 So thank you to everybody who did that.
 We're thinking about doing another boundaries masterclass
 in the fall, which is like the most intense version
 that you can do.
 It's only limited to five students.
 And that's because I wanna give hands on,
 I want to be intentional about helping people
 discover the story, discover how boundaries have set them up,
 where boundaries are helping them.
 Anyway, it's a glorious experience, but I finished it
 and I had lots of gladness with that.
 I really did.
  </li><li>So good.
 I love it.
 or talk about it.
  </li><li>Well wait, but if somebody were interested
 in doing the master class, how do they?
  </li><li>Well, I haven't opened up the doors yet.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So I've got a wait list for people who already did
 the summer school who are interested in doing the master class
 and I am letting them have 24 hours notice.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But hey, it's gonna be running.
 But I haven't even designed it.
 You haven't even planned it.
 I want to wait for the feedback from the students
 who did the master class so that I can incorporate
 their feedback into the next revision of the class
 because I constantly want to iterate
 and make it a great experience for people to do it.
  </li><li>Of course, dude, darling, that's who I know you to be.
  </li><li>It will probably be in the fall of some time,
 so September, October.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And just follow us on Instagram,
 follow us on social media @allen and AJ,
 or stay subscribed to the podcast, we'll talk about it.
  </li><li>Yeah, okay.
  </li><li>Look at you with your, hey,
 give the people a call to action.
  </li><li>Well, I would-- - There's nothing to action here.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, I was just more,
 I didn't know how far along you've gotten, so.
  </li><li>No, the, okay.
 The passion is there, the planning is not yet.
  </li><li>Lots going on.
  </li><li>For sure. - Yep.
  </li><li>So our topic for this week is how to build
 and maintain relationships.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>This all came out of a conversation I had earlier this week
 with our young adult pastors, Richard and Michelle Vouders.
 So I meet with them each week.
 And we were just talking about that.
 We were talking about relationships, how they're formed.
 And the more and more we talked about it
 and the more and more we went back and forth the three of us.
 I was like, okay, I've got the topic
 that we're gonna talk about this week.
 And it was just a really interesting discussion
 and it brought up a bunch of stuff.
 And I thought, okay, let's kick around some ideas.
 Before we kick around some ideas, before I throw it open,
 I thought it would be good to just set some principles,
 some larger overarching, overarching, overarching.
  </li><li>Over-arching.
  </li><li>Over-arching principles regarding relationships.
 Because when we teach this in the school
 or when we talk about this with people,
 usually people get tripped up with things
 that are actually just part of life.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So they're kicking against something
 that's actually inherently good
 in the way relationships are designed anyway.
 'Cause here's the thing, relationships.
 Heaven's, the fabric of heaven is relationships.
 Relationships are rich, we are designed by God
 to need relationships, to have relationships.
 God is a triune, highly relational person.
 And if you think about it,
 like the richest moments of our lives
 have all come out of relationships.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>And the most costliest hurt has come out of relationships.
 So relationships are just a tremendous gift.
  </li><li>And a risk.
  </li><li>And a huge risk.
 You're absolutely right.
 So here's three principles,
 guiding principles that have written down
 'cause I didn't wanna forget them.
 Number one is that some relationships in life are seasonal
 and that's totally okay.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like not every relationship has to be for life.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And that means if it's seasonal.
  </li><li>In fact, probably the majority won't be.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And that means that some relationships are going to end
 and that doesn't mean it's tragic or sad
 or we did relationships wrong.
 So if you think about it, you're a childhood relationship.
 You're childhood school friends.
 Like I don't think I'm in relationship
 with any of my elementary school friends.
 In fact, by the time I got to high school,
 I was maybe only in relationship with one of those
 and had developed new relationships in high school.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And then by the time I went to university,
 I didn't maintain any of those relationships
 because every reason, different cities
 and doing different relationships
 and I built new relationships in university.
  </li><li>Sure.
 of which, by the way, still exists to this day.
 But the others didn't.
 And nobody did anything wrong.
 We didn't have a big falling out.
 Nobody's hurt.
 That's--
  </li><li>Seasonal, that's what it looks like.
  </li><li>Yeah, in the previous jobs that we've had,
 you make friends at work.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And now I don't work there anymore.
 Those relationships don't exist.
 Man, don't exist, sounds like such a big, heady word.
 But my point is our relationship
 is a long-term relationship.
 It's gonna last for as long as we're alive.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And even then that's not guaranteed forever.
 'Cause one of us is,
 you know what I mean?
 Like life.
  </li><li>I was like,
 "What are you going with this?"
  </li><li>Life has got inbuilt limitations.
 And that's totally okay.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So a lot of the stuff has passed us
 that we've helped people walk through is like,
 relationships have ended and it's the end of the world.
 And I'm like, but maybe it isn't.
  </li><li>Great, you moved or you would have,
 and that's some things are just normally a transition thing
 where now you're transitioning out of some relationships
 that's not necessarily bad, but that doesn't mean it doesn't cost you anything.
 Exactly as well. It doesn't mean it doesn't hurt and there's a sadness around it.
 But it's worth putting that like... It's the nature of the beast.
 Absolutely. Number two, understand, it's important to understand that our relationships will differ
 in intensity and frequency, and that's also okay. What do I mean by that? Well, intensity is the
 depth of the connection and frequency is the amount of connection.
 Okay. By the way, it's also worth noting we have not spoken to any of our friends
 about us talking about our relationship with them on the podcast. So I would have
 honored out of courtesy. I don't want to name names. Okay. But we've got a variety of relationships
 that vary in depth of connection, yes, or intensity, yes, and and frequency. Yeah. Like, for example,
 but one of the most consistent friendships I have in my life is somebody I connect with every single week.
 Yes.
 That's a high frequency and high intensity relationship.
 Like we've been friends for years.
 It is literally an intentional relationship because we are the very beginning decided,
 "Hey, it feels like there's something here.
 What do you want to do about that?"
 And we've built it.
 And so by and large every week, I spend time, we spend time together.
 And it isn't, we don't talk about the weather.
 We're talking about rich, deep, intimate, hearty,
 sometimes hard, sometimes difficult,
 always joy-giving relationships.
 That is both high intensity and high frequency.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But then I also think about the friend I was talking about
 that I've had for years from university,
 that would be high intensity, but would be low frequency.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I probably connect, we don't even live
 in the same part of the world,
 but I probably connect via FaceTime,
 Like once a month, once every two months,
 like we don't have a standing connection
 like I do with this other friend,
 but it is still high intensity
 but it is lower frequency.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean both of the relationships
 are tremendously valuable to me.
  </li><li>Right, so it's also the friends where
 like you're saying intensity, I'd say depth,
 where you've maybe in a different season
 had a lot of depth with them and a lot of time.
 Yes.
 And now in your current season, whether it's because you moved like we did or whatever,
 it's the depth is still there, but maybe you only connect even less than that.
 Maybe it's, hey, once every six months or once every year or whatever,
 but it feels like the minute that you're with them, it's like,
 Absolutely.
 We just pick up where we left off.
 Exactly.
 Because the depth is that foundation there of depth just enables you to keep going there,
 even if you don't have a frequency.
  </li><li>Correct.
  </li><li>And it's not that those relationships are less valuable.
 It's like this is what life allows.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And again, that's okay.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>That would be terrible in marriage, by the way,
 if we only saw each other once a month.
  </li><li>Well, marriage isn't designed for that.
  </li><li>So we're not talking about marriage,
 we're talking about friendships here.
 All right.
 And then number three,
 we tend to attract as a general rule of thumb.
 We tend to attract the level of emotional and relational health that we're living in.
 And this is both good and bad.
 So what I mean by that, the bad thing is, like if you think about relationships that
 are toxic, one is an addict, you usually have an enabler.
 That is, there's an attraction there, because one needs the other.
 Right.
 I'm just saying, so I think that that point, where it gets foggy for me is we're going
 to talk later about you have relationships that you give away, that relationships that
 you receive. And right now we're talking about relationships that are both.
 I'm talking about let's just be aware that that dynamic exists and being having your eyes
 open helps you make informed decisions about the relationship you're building. So being
 aware that there is a dynamic that we tend to attract people of the emotional relational
 health, of course, there's exclusions to that. I've noticed in my life that I've often
 and being attracted to people who are healthier than me.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Right?
 So that gives me an indication of what is it about them
 that I'm drawn to?
 Oh, it's an area where I don't have.
 That rule is still there.
 And what's happened is when I've,
 and rule is way too rigid.
 I mean, that thing flexes.
 I'm just trying to point to a principle
 that kind of governs relationships
 within which we can operate.
 But being aware of that helps us be aware
 that there's a dynamic.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Think about a Jezebel.
 like in the Bible, Jezebel needed a knee-hab.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So that's what I mean, like there's this kind of toxicity
 and even though they seem opposite, they attract
 because that's the same level
 of emotional relational health.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>A good example, that would be Jonathan and David.
 Two super intense men.
 And yet they're connected, they're bonded
 in relationship and friendship.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>Courses exclusions to that.
 The Lord Jesus loves and seeks out relationship
 with all of us.
 And there's nowhere we're at the same level of relational health.
 And you're right.
 There are relationships where by design, one, perhaps, is further ahead than another.
 And that's also okay.
 But I just, I want to be able to point to that.
 Yeah.
 I mean, that's sort of more what I was thinking is, because I would probably say
 you're, you're probably attracted to people that are a little bit further along,
 but you're more comfortable.
 Well, you tend to draw towards you, the people at the same level as you,
 but you might be attracted to people who are further.
 Yeah.
 But equally, I mean, this to this day, the most mind boggling dynamic for me is beautiful,
 godly, authentic women who tend to be attracted to men who are not their caliber.
 Yes.
 And I want to be very careful seeing this.
 And I wrote it down to be the least offensive.
 Oh dear.
 OK, now I'm afraid is that what you are drawn to is often about what we believe about ourselves.
 So as a pastor, like from the outside, I'm connecting with somebody who's in my community and I'm like,
 "Oh my gosh, you are strong and you're capable and you're godly and you're awesome and you're
 wonderful. Can you help me understand why you're attracted to this person?" And it's like their
 view of themselves versus God's view of the person, right? There's some growth and area to go to. So
 we tend to be the average of the people we're hanging around with. So like a good yardstick of
 of where you are is look around who you're drawn to,
 who you're connecting with, and by and large,
 the company we keep says something
 about what we believe about ourselves.
  </li><li>Good.
  </li><li>Okay, so I haven't talked about these, like,
 overarching principles.
 Let's get down to brass tach, tachs.
 Is that a phrase Americans use?
 I'm looking at an Englishman.
 (laughs)
 And a Canadian.
  </li><li>Yes, brass tachs.
  </li><li>Yeah, let's talk about practically speaking.
 How do you build and how do you maintain
 healthy relationships?
 Where do we start, Adrijans?
 Well, I think initially when you're talking about forming relationships is like following
 favor. So when you meet someone and it seems like both of you actually want to get to know
 the other one, that it's not like a one sided thing, but it's like a, oh, you know, it seems
 like.
 And how do you gauge that? Give me, give me, talk me through a recent example of that,
 of course, don't mention names, but like talk to me about what is favor manifest like for
 you?
 For me, it manifests like I'm excited to see that person.
 Typically, it's going to be, I walked by them at church or something like that, but I come
 away from any conversations with them going, "Oh, I really like that person.
 I wish I knew them better."
 So it sparks joy in your heart.
 Yeah, it sparks joy.
 Or I'm looking forward to seeing them as I go to&acirc;€”even if it's just&acirc;€”you're going
 to see him for just a couple minutes, you know, but to realize, oh, actually, I have, there's
 a joyful emotion behind the thought of this person.
 What do you do when you feel that, but you're not sure if they feel that?
 So for example, you're at church, you meet somebody new, you're in the cafe, you bump
 in them, and you're like, "Hey, tell me where you're from."
 And you know, you visit Grace N'R-Blubble, and you start talking, you're like, "Oh my
 gosh."
  </li><li>There's something on that person.
 Like, what do you do when you're not sure
 if it's reciprocated?
  </li><li>Well, I think for me, historically,
 I'm probably a little more cautious.
 And so I would usually wait until there's been
 several different interactions where it feels like,
 oh, you're also not trying to exit this conversation.
  </li><li>So you're looking for signs that this favor for you?
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And then I would probably just say,
 do you wanna hang out and grab coffee?
 You know, something that's sort of low barrier of entry, you know.
 Low intensity, low frequency.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And just then see how does that feel?
 Like I'm not, um, this sounds awful.
 I'm not shopping for friends.
 Do you know what I mean?
 Like I'm not like, man, I don't have any friends.
 I've got some great friends, but I also want to meet new people and, you know, be friends
 with whoever the Lord's bringing across my path.
 You know, that is, that's part of the plan.
 So have you ever, someone's favorite in your eyes and you move towards them,
 but you don't have favor in their eyes.
 And if so, how did you determine that you don't have favor in their eyes?
 That is a good question.
 And my contemplator says, I haven't thought that through enough to answer.
 I mean, I, I, I can think of a couple times or at least one specific time when I was,
 was 20 years ago where I really wanted to be friends
 with this one person and I didn't realize
 they were terrified of me.
 And that had more to do with,
 I just needed an enormous amount of inner healing.
 And they were picking up stuff in me
 that I didn't pick up in myself.
 And so they were sort of like,
 they watched me for two years before we became friends.
 So they more stayed like, yeah, if it's a group thing,
 and I'm not talking dating, it wasn't a boy.
 but just sort of, they were a little bit more cautious,
 standoffish until, if I'm honest,
 I had gotten a little bit more healing
 and became a little bit less scary for them
 to enter into a relationship with.
 So I'm not sure if that's a great example or not, but--
  </li><li>I'm a great example, 'cause it's the example that you have.
 I'm thinking about, like for me,
 favor is like a burning bush.
 Like I've learned that favor isn't a guarantee of anything.
 So if you remember when, you know,
 Moses sees the burning bush and he says,
 I'll go over and see what this thing is.
 Favor for me is a stop and see.
 When I look back on my life,
 like favor hasn't always guaranteed
 there's going to be something.
 So right now I have a friend today
 that when I moved towards them initially,
 there was zero favor.
 And part of that was screw up on my end.
 So there's somebody who I was like,
 I didn't know them, but, and well,
 here's the other thing is they were,
 for one of the better phrase,
 they were a public figure and they were known.
 So here's a dynamic, like you encounter an author,
 a podcast or a YouTuber, a filmmaker, a speaker,
 a public figure that has impacted your life.
 There's this weird transaction
 where you have gained so much from them
 and they don't know you exist, right?
 And so it's weird because we build connection,
 relationship, and it's all lopsided.
 And this was this person.
 So here's somebody who was incredibly influential
 to me, they didn't know that.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I was carrying that thing of like,
 oh my gosh, you've totally impacted my life.
 I would love to connect with you
 because also I think it would be great friends.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Which is so horrible because you can't addition
 for friendship.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And if we don't understand that we'll get hurt.
  </li><li>Right.
 And then we just think, well that person's just mean
 or whatever.
  </li><li>That person's a jerk.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>That person doesn't even know you exist.
 And actually you were kind of rabid in the moment.
 And that's what happened.
 Like they, you know, and they were friends
 the friend of mine and I leveraged the friendship I had with my friend to get to them. That
 sounds way more horrendous than it is. Basically, a friend I do have is friends with this person
 and one day I happened to see them together and so I went up to say hi legitimately to
 my friend and introduced myself to this person because I thought they have favor in my eyes
 I wonder what will happen. And when I went to speak to this person I had zero favor in
 the rise. This person had zero interest in getting to know me. I tell that story because
 it's got a happy ending because today that person is a very good friend of mine. Here's
 what I want us to understand because often when we've talked about favor, it can be like
 this binary like you either have favor and if you don't, if you don't boo-hoo for you,
 right? And that's not what I'm saying. Sometimes not having favor in somebody's eyes is a gift
 from God. Yeah, because that person isn't going to be part of your story. And that's
 okay. Right. So God save you lots of energy, lots of emotion, lots of time, you know,
 buffering you to the relationships are going to be life to you and keeping you from the
 ones that won't be. So at that time, I went away, bombed because I would love a connection
 with this person. But I'm also aware, I didn't have that connection. And it could be me, it
 could be them, it could be God, it could be timing, it could be nothing.
 Right.
 Don't read like in the one sense favor is vital to learn how to grow in and
 steward. And in another sense, favor is really nothing at all.
 Right. So yeah, it's maybe just a potential spark.
 It's a spark and you you follow it and it might be, you know,
 you might find out there's nothing there.
 You might find there's nothing there and that's still okay.
 I've learned to let that go.
 I've learned not to worry about that.
 So same example, you meet somebody.
 Here's an example from a couple of weeks ago at church.
 I'm at church, I'm looking around,
 somebody I've never seen before in my life
 totally stands out to me
 and there's a curiosity in my heart, right?
 It's like a light upon them,
 I'm gonna go over and see what that light is.
 I don't even know if they have favor in my eyes.
 All I know is out of a room full of a couple of hundred people,
 this person stands out to me,
 so I go over and introduce myself to them,
 like, "Hi, how are you?"
 I'm Alan, I'm one of the leaders here,
 I just wanna welcome you, like you were where you're from,
 I'm trying to start a conversation.
 There's the conversation is okay.
 I'm not trying to gauge too much about whether it is or isn't.
 I'm thinking I'm so interested in this person.
 Like their favor, I'm interested to know why I'm interested in them.
 So I say, "Hey, I'd love to grab coffee with you."
 And they say, "Yeah, I'd love to.
 "So we swap numbers.
 "I text the person.
 "They ghost me.
 "They never get back to me."
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I don't go away going, "Oh my God, what's wrong with me?
 "Like, why can't I connect with these people?"
 I just think, "Okay, maybe it's unto something later.
 maybe it's not. Yeah. Hold all of these things loosely. Yeah. And try not to write a story about
 the other person or about yourself. Yeah. Because we tend to fall into the two ditches like they're
 mean or I'm sucky and neither are true. Well, maybe both are true, but it's unlikely.
 All right, so that's favor. Follow favor. Yes. See where favor leads you when you're in a
 our relationship as well. Allow favor to dictate what's going on.
 Yeah. Like don't be so worried that all relationships have to last forever.
 Or what happens is.
 Or looks the same. What do you mean? Well, I think sometimes we think, well,
 well, I don't even like the term anyway, but you know, when people are like, well,
 yeah, we're besties. Well, besties means something different to like everyone.
 And then also all different generations, you know what I mean?
 And so I sort of kind of avoid that altogether.
 All of my friendships that probably came down to it
 would I describe all these ladies as besties?
 Yes, you know, but every single one of them
 is completely different the amount of time
 that we get together, you know,
 even some of the depth that we have all different.
  </li><li>And all valuable.
  </li><li>And all valuable and they're not supposed
 to look the same.
 And I'm also not looking at their time
 that they spend with other ones of their girlfriends
 and going, well, I mean, if I was really besty,
 you know, like, I think that that whole thing
 of comparison and all that kind of stuff,
 it just, it'll eat relationship.
  </li><li>It never produces anything good.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Before we move on, circle back and talk about,
 you were talking about the relationship
 with where you had no favor, but then you said,
 well, but now I have favor.
 So what like?
 So, you know, I see my friend, I go up, like,
 it's clear I have no favor with this person.
 And so I let it go.
 And I'm just like, okay, I, you know,
 the math doesn't work.
 I can't be friends with everybody.
  </li><li>Can't make it happen.
  </li><li>And this person can't be friends with everybody.
 And this person doesn't know me from Adam.
 So I'm not offended they don't want to connect with me
 'cause they don't know me.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Like it was a one random thing.
 And so, like, now this person is a good friend of mine.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I'm trying to chart, how did that happen?
 And largely what happened was I got another opportunity
 to be in their orbit,
 and rather than trying to make something happen,
 I just, I don't know,
 I let the Lord promote me as a wrong word,
 but you know, I just,
 I got on with being me,
 without trying to curry favor with this person.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Because if you ever-- - We kept crossing paths
 to me, and I think that even all of that was the Lord,
 like just... Right, yes. Yeah, we did. We just, in the course of doing life or getting on with life,
 we happened to cross paths with the person. I believe that favor is a gift that God gives
 to somebody else on your behalf. Basically, God highlighted them to me and in the course of just
 doing life, our past kept intersecting and we had opportunities to kind of meet a little bit more
 And it grew into something.
 It grew into the thing that I wished I'd always had,
 but didn't.
 But I didn't really do anything about it
 other than just worked on being myself.
  </li><li>Yeah, be normal.
  </li><li>And probably the first time I met them,
 I was less like myself and more like a version of myself.
 'Cause like, oh, here's this person.
 I really want them to like me.
  </li><li>Well, you were nervous.
  </li><li>Yeah, I was I nervous?
 I mean, you were there.
  </li><li>Oh, yes.
  </li><li>You experienced me as nervous.
  </li><li>Yeah, like this stuff.
 Yeah, I probably have touch with what I was feeling
 'cause I was in some sort of trauma, like, please like me.
 You know, but also when they didn't like me,
 I was okay with it, wasn't I?
 I'm not thinking if I was out of touch with--
  </li><li>I mean, I think so.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So, I'm sure there's a lesson in there.
 All right, we've got to step one, follow favor.
 Step number two, I would say
 is don't be afraid of relationship audits.
 And by a relationship audit, I mean,
 Don't be afraid of actually working out
 which relationships are giving you the most amount
 of life in this season.
 And don't be afraid of allocating resources
 to the relationships that are giving you life
 and maybe lessening the relationships that aren't.
 Like you're not a bad person for doing that.
 You're actually stewarding your time.
 You're stewarding your influence.
 You're stewarding your relationships.
 And here's why I encourage you to do that intentionally.
 It's gonna happen whether you do or not.
  </li><li>Right. - But all relationships
 will run a course in their life.
  </li><li>Yes. - You know, you'll get busy,
 you'll move away, that person will get a promotion,
 that person gets married,
 and then start spending less time with you.
 Not because of you, but because they're now married,
 they'll have kids, they'll have two kids,
 a medical disaster, like life will take care of ebbs and flows.
 So don't be afraid to stand back and observe that
 and evaluate that and then adjust your priorities
 as that needs to be.
 Does that make sense?
  </li><li>Yeah, that makes sense.
 I think it can be tricky if you're more sort of,
 I don't know that I want to say emotionally wired,
 but if you--
  </li><li>What do you mean by emotionally wired?
  </li><li>Well, that's why I don't know if I want to say it.
 I'm just thinking like, you can assess things and go,
 okay, so these people, you know, boom, boom, boom, boom,
 they, when I'm with them, I feel full, you know,
 I have life, you know, I feel yay.
 And then these people, I'm still friends with these people,
 but it's, there's more effort on my part.
 There's more, you know, there's more spend.
  </li><li>Yes. - Does that make sense?
 And so, but I think I also know people
 who maybe tend to be more emotive than I am
 or that can't assess things like that.
 like it feels wrong to them to assess based on spend and joy level, that it's like, well,
 that's, that's not okay to, uh, to feel like some people cost you more when in reality,
 some people just do cost you more.
 And also that's not bad.
 That's not bad.
 And you can assess it and go and you're worth the cost or I don't have capacity in this
 scene.
 Right.
 So I was also just thinking that like that it can sound super clinical and callous and
 callous, but I also feel like in different seasons of life, there is times when you need
 to pair back and realize I'm at capacity.
 And so my capacity looks like I'm going to be what what time I have, I'm going to spend
 with those who fill my tank. And for fill my tank, I also mean, those are people who after
 I've been with them, I feel my heart feels full. I feel like you I mean, they're all
 Christians are all people that I'd be like, Oh, I want to go. Like I'm excited that we
 talked about that. And I want to go look at like, I feel encouraged in every area of my
 my life because we're running in the same direction with the same kind of goals.
 And then I also have seasons where I'm like, ooh, I feel like I have more capacity and
 could spend more time with people who I am aware I'm choosing.
 And it costs me more.
 And it's costing me more, but it's still so worth it.
 Right.
 helpful to introduce the three types of relationships we tend to think about when we're stewarding
 our relationships. So three types of relationships, there's more, but the model that we use is
 there's relationships that we're investing in with people and the gain, it's not more about them and
 less about me, like, so I'll talk about me rather than we. So there's relationships that I've got
 in my life. Let's start in the middle that are just so symbiotic and so, you know, being
 with this person is easy and it's life giving and it's iron sharpens iron and it's wonderful
 and it's rich and it's easy and it comes naturally and it's great. And that relationship is each
 party is getting life from it and it's beautiful. Then there's relationships where, here's a great
 example where I'm being mentored, where somebody is spending time with me, and largely if I'm
 honest, I'm probably the greater recipient of that relationship where they are.
 Right. They're spending on you.
 They're spending on me and I'm going away with all this. And it's not to say that they're like,
 you know, being held hostage and have to do that. There is life giving. But like, I think about,
 I think about John Arnott, for example, like, there's nothing I can teach John Arnott. Like,
 there's nothing I can, you know, he's not going to be wowed by my revelation on the prophetic,
 because everything I learned came from him.
 Like, you know, so being with John,
 like I go away so filled.
 Now, hopefully being with John is not arduous
 and painful for John.
 Right. Right.
 But I'm coming away like feeling full.
 If I go out with John, like there's not much I can do for him.
 He earned more money than me.
 Oh, you're going to spend more time listening
 and you're going to. Exactly.
 And I'm understanding that I'm the greater recipient
 in that relationship. Yes.
 And I'm sure if you spoke to John, he'd be like,
 Oh, I love Alan, but I can't offer him what he offers me.
 Right.
 And that's OK.
 Yes.
 And then there's other relationships.
 So the other extreme where I'm giving away more of me
 and I'm getting less back, but the relationship
 is just as valuable.
 Because I'm sewing.
 I'm investing into this person.
 And I might not be coming away going, man,
 they're insight on that with revelation.
 Because I'm not in relationship with them for insight.
 I'm in relationship with-- for companionship.
 Or I just love the vulnerability that this person has.
 But going away, it's not quite like the middle one.
 Am I making sense for that example?
 Like so there's ones where you're both win,
 there's ones where one of you seems to be winning more
 and there's ones where you seem to be winning less.
  </li><li>I don't like winning, but receiving.
  </li><li>Winning is terrible work.
  </li><li>But they're receiving.
  </li><li>But even then I think of the relationships I have
 where I'm investing in other people
 and I might not be coming away with stuff
 that I would be from other relationships,
 but there's still value in it.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>But it costs me more.
 It doesn't come as easily.
 Yeah.
 Those three relationships, that's also helpful to do in an audit.
 If all of your relationships are the one where you're giving away, no wonder you're feeling
 maybe burnt out and exhausted because you're not getting filled up.
 And when you talk about an audit, you're not suggesting sitting down with this person
 and saying, "Hey, I've come to the revelation that really..."
 Right.
 The cost benefit analysis of this relationship.
 It's you're more talking about it with yourself.
  </li><li>As you step back.
  </li><li>In different seasons, as you step back,
 assessing, oh, what relationships am I currently active in?
 And where's my spend?
 Where's my--
  </li><li>Which relationships am I flourishing in?
 Which relationships am I investing in?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I mean, you know, which relationships
 the power is receiving from?
 And making sure there's a balance there.
  </li><li>Yeah, and I've also had times where the Lord's like,
 hey, this person, I want you to just plan
 that you're spending.
  </li><li>But I wonder if part of the reason--
  </li><li>Well, let me finish.
 Those relationships now,
 they're the equal even, we both receive,
 but they started off with,
 you plan that you're going in to spend,
 not to receive.
 And a couple of them are now,
 lifelong relationships.
 So, you know, and then I've also had ones where I just plan to spend and it's a short term spend and I still get, I still get plenty, but it's, you know, so I think, again, you're back to seasons and that's too.
 But well, I was going to say I wonder if part of the reason we have such rich rewarding relationships is because we've sewn where we want to go.
 And by that, I mean, like, one of the things we've never lacked in life is prophetic revelation.
 Yes.
 But one of the things we spend a huge amount of time doing is giving away prophetic revelation.
  </li><li>True. - Like, so we've sold out tons of prophetic ministry, prophetic words,
 prophetic direction, prophetic encouragement, and we also seem to receive it.
 But also over the years, we've spent years investing in relationships that might not be the biggest payoffs then,
 and we've either received from those relationships in life, or God's given us other relationships,
 which are incredibly rich and rewarding.
 So yeah, follow favor, audit your relationships.
 Yes.
 Number three.
 So number three is time is your most valuable asset.
 So steward it well.
 And again, this kind of tags on to number two.
 Like this is why you're doing relationship audits.
 Again, internally, not with the actual person is to be able to steward your time in the
 current season that you're in.
 So that you can intentionally decide where you're going to spend your time and what relationships
 you're investing in.
 Yeah.
 I remember a really powerful conversation I had where a friend basically came to me and
 just challenged me on that like, Hey, it feels like this relationship is really important
 to you, like our relationship.
 But the amount of time that we spend together is lower.
 And so I really want to challenge the notion that is important.
 I was like, that is a great, great perspective.
 And this was years ago, like 10, 15 years ago,
 but that really challenged me to think about the relationships.
 So even the one that I have,
 I was talking about that every week I spend relationship.
 I remember way back when that started
 in its most embryonic phases, it would be favor.
 We'd had a met for a couple of coffees
 and met up a couple of times over the years.
 And I remember this person saying,
 "Hey, I would love to do relationship with you."
 Which by the way is a key,
 it's always worth asking what that phrase means to you.
  </li><li>Why does that mean to you?
  </li><li>So they would say, "How would love to do life with you?
 "Hey, I'd love to be in relationship with you.
 "Hey, I'd love to build a friendship."
 Like right there, do an audit, like,
 what does that mean to you?
 Because for some people, "Hey, I don't know what,
 "do life with you?"
 means, "Let's get a coffee once in a while."
 On one end of the extreme, to other people,
 it's like, "Let's sell everything we have,
 "live on a commune together and share everything."
 I'm just like, "No."
 So I spent some time with this person,
 like, "What does that mean to you?"
 And what are you prepared to invest and what would that look like for you?
 And like, I remember, like we just talked about that.
 Well, that looked like, and I remember both of us going away and praying about that.
 Well, and you prayed about it for ages before you came back together and discussed
 what you, but it could look like.
 Right.
 Because if I'm going to spend time, invest time, which is the most valuable asset I have,
 I'm actually a steward of the time that God's given me.
 So is this going to be, is this where the Lord's going?
 And I remember the Lord very clearly saying this relationship will be, you know,
 a life-giving relationship to you and to them.
 This is a long-term relationship.
 This is a great area to invest.
 And so I was like, okay, great.
 So armed with that, haven't done that audit.
 I know where I'm going, I know what I'm investing.
 And it's just a huge reward, huge dividends
 in terms of friendship.
  </li><li>So that may sound quite intimidating.
 Like sit down and have this conversation about what,
 'cause I would say I don't know that I've,
 with any of my current, like with my besties,
 all of those have been organic relationships.
 None of them have, I sat down and had that conversation.
  </li><li>But I would say that has been organic too
 because I didn't meet with them going, okay,
 well here's my 20-point questionnaire
 before we enter into an agreement to be friends.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>It came out organically and the needs and the desires
 and the longings, you know, all happened very organically.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I'm probably describing it very clinically.
  </li><li>Yeah, it sounds clinical and I'm like,
 But then a lot of my process is very procedural in nature.
 Like all of my decision making as a high contemplator
 is go away, be with God, think, process, pray, then act.
  </li><li>Yes, and I think some of that comes down to
 wanting to be a person of your word.
 And so if you're actually going to say,
 yes, I would like to do this,
 you wanna make sure I have the time to do this,
 I have the emotional resources to do this,
 the willingness to, you know what I mean?
 So that it doesn't become, well, you said we were going to be friends and, you know,
 but I would also say to counter your thing, I've watched you do versions of that with
 your relationships.
 Yeah, I just mean, I don't, I don't, I have probably, but probably not like sit down and
 just had like a, what does friendship mean to you?
 This is what it means to me.
 No, let's go away and pray for a month.
 And then, you know, I haven't.
 But to be sure I haven't done that either.
 That version of it sounds.
 I just realized it sounded kind of like that.
 I'm happy that you clarified that.
 Yeah.
 So time working out where you're going to spend your time super important.
 Yeah.
 In addition to time, another important component is to think about trust.
 Today's podcast is brought to you by the letter T.
 Well, trust determines really the strength of your relationship.
 You can't go far with trust.
 Yeah, without trust, without trust.
 Yes, with trust.
 Yeah, I meant the other one.
  </li><li>We say this all the time when we teach on,
 which we're gonna come with confrontation in a second,
 but you can't drive a five ton truck of confrontation
 over a one ton bridge of relationship.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So trust determines where you can go in relationships.
 So that's another thing I used to help audit,
 what kind of relationship is this?
 I remember a friend saying,
 "Why are I getting some feedback?"
 And they said, "How long have you known that?"
 And I said, "A couple of years,
 why have you never given me that?"
 I was like, "We didn't have the,
 Look how hard it is for you to receive this feedback now.
 Right.
 What would have been alike a couple of years ago to say, oh, by the way, this.
 Right.
 So you're building, you know, friendship, relationship, you're looking for trust.
 You're looking for like, how far can we go?
 I would also say though, babe, we have the added dynamic of we are also leaders.
 Okay.
 So a lot of the people that we might be friends with, not all of them, but in some, for some
 of them, we are also we also function in the capacity of a leader in their environment as well.
 And so sometimes I think like when I'm thinking about how I might as a friend, I might respond
 like this, but with an awareness of I am a leader with an awareness of maybe how leaders have treated
 them in the past or things that might going on, I'm probably going to respond a little bit
 differently with an awareness of the two roles that I play, even if, even if friendship is a bigger
 role than leader, you know, because, because you have relationship, you know, I'm, I'm also
 often aware of that of like, Oh, that's interesting. I'm thinking you're absolutely right. Like,
 several of my friends I have, I'm also the leader, but I don't enter the relationship with them as
 as their leader.
 Of course I am, but I never lean on that.
 I'm always leaning on,
 I access them through the friendship portal
 rather than their leader portal.
  </li><li>Well, so that's what I'm saying.
 I am doing that, but I am aware as well,
 that like just things like I,
 I even though we're friends,
 I don't tend to say things flippantly or whatever,
 because I'm also aware that I have a capacity to wound
 as a leader, even though I think we're just meeting as friends.
 Does that make sense?
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Then I also think a lot of the friends
 that we have are also leaders in their own right.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So there's also that interest in dynamic at play.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So number five, watch for emerging patterns.
  </li><li>What do you mean by that?
  </li><li>So, you know, if you realize all of your,
 you're having relationship after relationship
 and they're all train wrecking in the same,
 you know, in the same way,
 or you realize, oh, I get super close with people really fast
 and then I realize everybody backs away from me or whatever.
 So those kinds of things are indications
 that we probably need some help
 with how to do relationship in a healthy way
 when you keep getting the same results
 that you don't wanna get,
 but it's just happening over and over again.
  </li><li>Yeah, we often talk about like,
 if every relationship follows the same path,
 step back and see what the common denominator is.
 Sometimes the common denominator is you.
 Sometimes the common denominator is the type of people
 you're in relationship with.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But basically that paying attention
 or being aware of the dynamics
 is like a gift waiting to be discovered.
 Like what is it that I don't know?
 Like I remember, this is years ago
 that a lot of my relationships would go so far
 and they wouldn't go any further
 because I actually wasn't willing to risk.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so it was friends who called me on that
 like, "Hey, have you noticed?"
 And I was like, you know, first I thought they were wrong.
 And then I was like, oh, dang it, they're right.
 Yes.
 Oh, yeah.
 This far you may come and know more.
 Okay.
 And then, you know, explore what's in my story
 that led me there.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Or, yeah.
 You've talked about calamity.
 It doesn't just have to be calamity.
 It could just be things fizzle out.
 Or I think like paying attention to your story
 helps you set realistic expectations.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Going forward.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>One of the, probably the transition we've all experienced.
 being on both sides of it.
 Like I remember when one of my friends,
 we were both single at the time,
 and one of my friends got engaged.
 And I remember feeling really hurt
 that he started spending more time
 with his fiance than me, right?
 Now at the time, I didn't have capacity
 to see beyond the horizons I had.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Like all I could do interpret was that guy's a jerk,
 'cause he said that we were friends, but now look,
 he's off, yes, he's off building a new relationship
 with the person he's betrothed to for the rest of his life.
 like it was hard for me to come to terms with that relationship by necessity is more important
 than his relationship with me. And that's not wrong. That's called relational health.
 Well, and growth and maturing and life. But we've all gone through that because, you know,
 a number of years later, I'm the person that's getting married and probably the people I'm
 a relationship with are like, can't believe I'm spending more time with AJ than with me.
 Probably not because they're probably in a healthy place than I was. But that's just
 one example of like, okay, like pay attention to the narrative that you write when things
 don't go your way. So for example, I remember a time in our life when some friends of ours
 were, they were probably noticing a pattern like, Hey, you spend less time with us than
 we once did. And in order to help them what they didn't realize is yet, and the time that
 we used to spend a lot of time with you, our life looked one way. And now our life looks
 completely differently. Like now we have three small children. Yes. You know, all under the age
 of six. Yes. You have no children. And so your life looks large, is the same. Your life is out of
 control. And the stresses on your job look very different from the stresses of our job. And only
 one of you works and both of us work. And you know, now those people, their lives look much more like
 ours. And so probably they're gracing their understanding of what you're going through is
 is different.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And also you can't blame people for where they're at
 because they don't know.
 And the same way that I was looking at my friend going,
 why are you spending more time with me?
 Just understand that that whole thing flexes
 and paying attention to the parent
 and getting outside perspectives is really, really helpful.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And make sure you're not writing a story
 about that person and what they can actually,
 what they can give you.
 Because we rarely actually realize how full
 another person's life actually is.
  </li><li>Right.
 And another way of doing that,
 like being careful about the story you're writing is if you've developed trust, which
 was whatever point it was, point four, right?
 Yeah.
 If you've got trust, you can go to them and say, "Hey, I'm writing this story."
 Can you tell me if any of it is true?
 Yes.
 Because tremendous joy.
 I mean, we just did that this week.
 Like, "Hey, hello friend.
 I'm writing this story about you."
 Can you tell me if any of that's true?
 No, none of that's true.
 Oh my gosh, so much relief.
 I feel so much better, okay.
 So, and that's why trust is beautiful.
 Yeah.
 All right, point number six are final point before we pivot into something different.
  </li><li>Is learning to grow in the fine arts of communication,
 confrontation, and having a value for boundaries.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm sad that boundaries didn't start with a C
 'cause then we could have had three Cs, but okay.
 Communication.
  </li><li>Confrontation.
  </li><li>Confrontation.
  </li><li>And boundaries.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I remember when Dan Farrelly from Bethel came,
 he said this brilliant line, he said that confrontation
 is healthy and conflict is normal.
 Like that just set a new paradigm
 and new expectation for relationship.
 Of like actually having a confrontation,
 having a conflict doesn't mean the relationships about to end.
 But again, if that's been your story,
 that's why it could be scary.
 But learning that like being in relationship
 with other people who have different opinions from you
 is gonna produce conflict.
 Like even in our marriage, we have conflict,
 we need confrontation.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And it's good and it's healthy and actually having--
  </li><li>It actually builds a relationship.
  </li><li>It strengthens if it done well.
 But you need a healthy understanding of boundaries.
 Otherwise, all the other person's communication
 is going to end up in your rejection bucket.
 Yeah.
 Like if you can't hear no without feeling rejected,
 you're going to have very, very shallow relationships.
 Because those relationships are all going to be codependent.
 Well, you become a scary person to have relationship with
 or even to attempt.
 Yeah.
 Well, that's the scary thing.
 Like, again, this is why trust is important.
 Like going to people that you love
 And you've demonstrated, like, I'll be okay with the answer and asking,
 how do you experience me is one of the most refreshing, rewarding and
 terrifying things to do.
 Yes.
 Because a lot of us don't know how we're being experienced.
 We have a story and usually we're the hero of the story and other people are
 mean and actually just stepping back and actually exploring like, how am I
 experienced by my friends in my community is really, really helpful.
 Yeah.
 Any other thoughts about any of that stuff?
 I think I just want to circle back to one thing.
 And the reason I'm thinking about it is I'm thinking in light of, you know,
 last year where it felt like, uh, it felt like there was like this pervasive thing
 of if we don't agree, we can't be friends.
 Oh, yes.
 You know, throughout the whole year.
 And certainly, uh, because most of us were in our homes launching
 grenades from social media, uh, it made, made it much worse.
 But that felt like a pervasive thing of like, unless we agree on everything,
 you and I can't be friends. And but that isn't actually true. And it's not at all healthy. So
 being able to confront well and ask good questions and not assume that you know the answers and
 communicate what you're feeling and have boundaries and all those kind of things and do life together,
 whether you agree or not, but because you've chosen to be friends is a way healthier way of
 of doing things, then I will only be friends with those that agree with me.
 Because nobody's ever going to challenge you're never going to grow anymore.
 If what you're looking for is we must all agree to be friends.
 You're going to have really a shallow life because nobody's ever going to challenge
 the things that you're choosing to to hang on to.
 So yeah, I guess it's just more of an encouragement of don't just surround
 yourselves with people that have the exact same opinion because I don't think
 that's healthy at all.
  </li><li>All right, let's pivot here.
 Here's where we're gonna pivot.
 Let's wrap this up, 'cause this is already a long podcast.
 I, before we started recording this,
 asked about on Instagram,
 so then we have any questions.
 We got some really good questions.
 So rather than trying to sandwich all those questions in,
 let's stop, let's record a brand new episode
 just on questions about this episode.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And then we'll launch that one.
 So, hope this has been super encouraging.
 Stay tuned because next week we're going to be answering the questions all about this topic.
