<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to episode one sixty seven of keeping up with the Joneses this week we're talking about fasting how to do it and why you'd possibly want to ever give up one of the grace things in life.
 Food before we get to that yeah,<br/>
 he Jones yes sir.<br/>
 How the heck are you I'm well how are you I am.
 Sporting a beard yes tell me your thoughts. Um my thoughts are we need to buy you a new razor
 Oh, come on<br/>
 I it all started this week because my razor has broken. I mean, I've got plenty of like normal razors
 But I don't like I don't really like analog anything in my life
 So the thought of like scraping a sharp instrument against my face
 Without you know some sort of battery powered electricity Wi-Fi connected device just seems barbaric
 So I just let it grow.<br/>
 You need help.<br/>
 And then, you know, the students were like, Hey, you're going to be here.
 And I'm like, it's not so much growing a beard.
 It's that remarkably.<br/>
 Agey hasn't commented on.<br/>
 So I think I might get away with it.<br/>
 And so it's been seven days.<br/>
 And then this morning, you were like, are you planning on shaving ever?
 And so you just don't like beards.<br/>
 I don't.<br/>
 To be fair, this isn't a great example of a beard.
 It isn't.<br/>
 I don't don't have the poor growth for it.
 Not the poor growth.<br/>
 Well, my pores are all so far apart that.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I just look we have a sporadic kind of ratty looking beard.
 I know I love you, but thanks.<br/>
 It's not much of a point.<br/>
 Well, I'm waiting for the particular razor.
 I like on Amazon to go and sail, then I'll buy it and then I'll shave again.
 But until then, welcome to ZZ Top.<br/>
 OK.<br/>
 So it was a good week this week, wasn't it?
 It's all my dreams are coming true.<br/>
 Well, do tell because you're in tomorrow.
 I am getting into Mario Kart.<br/>
 Really you want to upgrade your getting into video proof of you in mario car.
 It is so I let a mosquito bite me just so I wouldn't lose my place.
 Not only that.<br/>
 It's so refreshing to hear another parent of the house.
 No, no, no, don't talk to me right now.
 I just have to win this tournament, which is what you said several times today.
 And I'm like, oh, my parenting goals are complete.
 Now, both of us are ignoring our children.
 Well, the bad thing is I don't even really know how to pause it.
 So there's no pausing.<br/>
 Once you're in, you're in it to win it.
 But you did pause it.<br/>
 I know, but I'm not showing you how to do that because I like the fact that you're
 totally focused.<br/>
 How many tournaments have you won so far?
 Um, I have like, I think I have three cups just at 50 cc.
 So it's not like I'm, but I'm learning to glide.
 No drift drift.<br/>
 Yeah, you're a door.<br/>
 Yeah, that's still a slide away.<br/>
 No, but you are you're you're you're great.
 And initially when I tried to teach you about drifting, you were like, this
 I'm never going to need this.<br/>
 And then you started playing on sand and snow.
 Well, Rainbow Road is brutal.<br/>
 Oh, baby.<br/>
 Seriously, if you wanted another baby,
 you can have one right now.<br/>
 Just for knowing the names of the courses I'm in love.
 Oh, well.<br/>
 Oh, my God.<br/>
 Come and get it, baby.<br/>
 We'll be right back.<br/>
 Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

 No number three is really number one.<br/>
 I have an issue well the thing i'm laughing about the switch or is mj call that the Nintendo switch to give it it's full title.
 Is it can go anywhere with us so friday was my day off i know we're jumping ahead in the week but friday my whole goal is to play as much more car as possible.
 And at one point you're like babe you actually have to leave the house vitamin D doesn't need to touch your skin and i was like fine and i could just take the device with me everywhere we went which i love.
 I'm trying to influence everybody know to get one second play online.
 So hey everybody if you know me please buy the intent to switch so i can play mario carto deluxe with you over the internet great thanks.
 Yeah. All right, and non-Nintendo matters.
 Review the week for me.<br/>
 Well, we started off the week by teaching the healing lives hurts week at S.O.S.L.
 So,<br/>
 tools that keep our heart free from pain, but actually inadvertently keep God out.
 So all these defense mechanisms we develop as we grow up to keep pain away,
 do a great job.<br/>
 But the problem is they also keep the love of God out.
 So we need a better solution.<br/>
 And so it's amazing, isn't it?<br/>
 I love the whole push pause on life and finding a better way of doing things than we were
 never called to pain management.<br/>
 True.<br/>
 We called to life and abundant life.<br/>
 Yeah, absolutely.<br/>
 So we talked about that, which is great.
 Michelle Vouro's a little fire star.<br/>
 She's a pyromaniac.<br/>
 You weren't there, but she talked about fire.
 And she was amazing.<br/>
 Of course, she was talking about fire in our hearts, but she used all examples from literal
 fire, setting fire to things in her backyard.
 That doesn't surprise me somehow.<br/>
 We had a fire last week.<br/>
 I think you were away.<br/>
 Was that last week?<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 We had a fire pit in the back garden for all of about two minutes until the fire
 started just burned out.<br/>
 But when I put the kids to bed at night, they all smell like I'm a barbecue
 pit.<br/>
 I loved it.<br/>
 A barbecue pit.<br/>
 A fire pit.<br/>
 OK.<br/>
 What do you call it?<br/>
 What is it?<br/>
 A fire pit.<br/>
 They smell like smoke.<br/>
 But do you think it's like safe to have our fire pit on our deck, which is made out of wood?
 Sure.<br/>
 OK.<br/>
 I mean, what's the worst that happened to burns down?
 Yes, that is the worst that happened.<br/>
 But it's not like the wood is soaked in oil.
 Wait a minute.<br/>
 I don't know.<br/>
 It's way more convenient.<br/>
 OK.<br/>
 And the fires contained.<br/>
 Yes, it is.<br/>
 I did look up on Amazon.<br/>
 You can buy these like, I don't know what they are.
 They're like, it's called fabric concrete that you put grills on.
 It's supposed to stop sparks reaching out and starting a fire.
 But I was like, is that really necessary?
 I guess we'll find out.<br/>
 People who know more, which let's face facts.
 Please send us information.<br/>
 You're listening to the level of our understanding.
 So you definitely know more and let us know whether we should worry about that.
 That was Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday.
 We had our all staff meeting.<br/>
 I love Wednesdays.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 My favorite day of the week.<br/>
 Really?<br/>
 Yeah, I love it.<br/>
 I'd love getting to be with all the people we love.
 That's so cool.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 So we had all staff.<br/>
 We talked about culture of honor with life languages, which was a lot of fun.
 It was really, really good.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 And then I went to my first dance class.
 Oh, how was that darling?<br/>
 I mean, it was amazing.<br/>
 And a lot of levels.<br/>
 And on some other levels.<br/>
 I totally triggered.<br/>
 So define triggering.<br/>
 Well, like started bawling crying and just got really in touch with a bunch of
 disappointment from when I stopped dancing because I got injured.
 So I stopped dancing because I was injured.
 And, you know, it's been 30 years and I just realized, uh, oh, wow, this actually, I haven't ever thought about this.
 So yeah.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And then, you know, she's, she's teaching us to sort of be free.
 Well, we're dancing.<br/>
 She being Miss Alina who was on the podcast a couple of weeks.
 Yes.<br/>
 So she's teaching the course and it's amazing.
 And of course she's a dancer and they're trying to sort of free you up to sort of move with the Lord.
 but I only really did ballet seriously and it's all about precision and knowing the right moves and there's no right moves to know.
 And so I'm really hitting a little bit for a block like oh, oh, I can't perform.
 Oh, you know, so it's great.<br/>
 Yeah, you're you're adorable.<br/>
 You came home.<br/>
 Yeah, just sat in the edge of the bed and burst into tears.
 I got really triggered tonight and I was like, oh, baby.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And it's funny because cognitively you weren't aware of this was an area of
 disappointment in your life.<br/>
 I wasn't.<br/>
 I mean, I mean, I remember it being disappointing then, but, you know,
 seriously, we're talking 30 years, you know, since I danced.
 So yeah, I wasn't, I wasn't anticipating that at all.
 Sounds like you got your own healing life's hurts this week.
 I did.<br/>
 And I'm, I'm thinking about Wednesday, like, do I really want to go back in there?
 But I'm like, I do.<br/>
 Cause, you know, even if I ball, it doesn't matter.
 I don't want to run from that.<br/>
 So good for you.<br/>
 And then Thursday you had your own, uh, triggering moments.
 I'm not sure about that.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Did, um, I went to see grief counselors for the first time.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I just figured losing two parents in two years.
 Probably, I remember when I lost my mom, I remember coming home and speaking to
 Christine Stroup, who is our personal ministry's pastor, who's just like this
 inner healing ninja.<br/>
 And I remember going in with Christine said, Christine, I think I'm okay.
 but just because I think I'm okay, it doesn't mean I am.
 Can I sit under your microscope and can you just, you know, check my heart?
 And we talked through a bunch of stuff and that was super helpful.
 And, you know, with my dad dying, I don't know whether I
 spoke to a bunch of people and I don't know if it's because it was my dad dying
 or because now I'm without both parents.
 But it affects me slightly different question mark.
 And so I'm trying to process that.<br/>
 And so I thought it'd be really good to process some of what I am
 feeling with a counselor that deals with grief. And so I had my first session.
 Yeah. And that was, it's always weird speaking to people about issues of the heart who don't
 know you in some ways. It's entirely refreshing because they have no paradigm in other ways.
 It's entirely frustrating because they, you know, they don't know who you are or where you're at.
 And so I'm not making any judgments of our first session is giving me some great reading to do.
 I'm looking forward to digging into that, especially because it's C.S. Lewis, who, you know, I really like C.S.
 is C.S. writing. Mr. Lewis, Professor Lewis.
 -Monsieur Lewis. -The dude, the real dilemma, which in the wardrobe I like to frame.
 -That guy. -Yeah.<br/>
 So I'm looking forward to reading that. -Yeah.
 -So that was Thursday. -Yeah.<br/>
 And then Thursday night, we got to hang out and have dinner with friends, which was just absolutely glorious.
 -And yummy. -I think probably the most delicious grilled chicken I've ever eaten in my life.
 -I agree.<br/>
 And oh wait wait stop the press yes i know we haven't got to saturday yes can we just talk about burger extravaganza.
 No we're not saturday you have to keep it in order people want to know in order i'm i'd be mace if anybody wants to know this people probably get on with it what's the topics you said fasting friday we already talk about friday i play video games all day video games you did yes blame video games all day the movie kids and saturday my partner.
 Oh, okay. Well, no, Saturday we cleaned. We did. Or try to teach our kids how to tidy their bedroom.
 Yes, and it's frustrating. Well, I just realized it's it's it's
 tall and cool, isn't it? And we don't exactly do the best job of keeping things tidy. No.
 So it was fun to teach. I say it was fun. I sound like a freak. It was fun teaching my daughter
 closet etiquette. How do you go and hangers? Well, I mean, there was I had a huge checklist on
 on Saturday, like 18 things.<br/>
 And I got like 15 of them done.
</p><ul>
  <li>So you were happy.
  </li><li>I just was like, yes, just knocking things
 off my checklist.
 But, you know, a couple of them is to go through
 their closets and get rid of everything
 that doesn't fit them.
 So we've done that now.
 So that's great.
  </li><li>Oh, and then Saturday night, I made my burger.
 Where were you?
 You went, oh yeah, you were at a birthday party.
 So I was home alone, which I loved.
 And I perfected my burger, which I tried weeks before.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So basically.
  </li><li>Well, you say you perfected it.
 I haven't actually tasted this burger,
 so it's all up for interpretation.
  </li><li>So basically I took half a pound of ground beef.
  </li><li>I still can't believe you ate the entire half pound.
 And there was more than half a pound in that container.
  </li><li>No, no, I didn't use it all.
 So there's still some left to work.
 Half a pound of ground beef shoved it in the freezer
 for 15 minutes with a packet of pepperoni
 in the freezer for 15 minutes,
 which I learned from binging with Babish,
 which if you haven't watched the YouTube channel
 binging with Babish, I can't help you.
  </li><li>Yes, it's amazing.
 So put it in the freezer for 15 minutes to firm up,
 then shoved it in a food processor
 and kind of ground it all up.
 The pepper only, the ground beef, some onion, some garlic.
 I threw in some red chili flakes.
 I threw in some maple syrup and some soy sauce.
 I'm just kind of got it into a paste consistency.
 Then molded it into a half pound burger.
 Really, that's a lot of meat when I realized it.
  </li><li>That's a lot of meat.
  </li><li>I wasn't thinking.
 Grilled it, only to discover
 I don't have any hamburger buns.
 So reluctantly used two slices of gluten-free bread, which was not a banner moment.
 Then, butter the bread, toasted the bread, then, uh, romaine some tomato, sharp cheddar
 on top of that bad boy, some barbecue sauce.
 Then I made some fries, some Cajun fries with some cayenne pepper.
 Yeah.
 And you had made some of the best fresh herb aioli, which I use both on the burger and
 as a dip for the fries.
 You're welcome.
 at least half credit for the burger and fries.
 It was so good.
 It was like salty, sweet, spicy, meaty.
 Ah, it was just superb.
 I bet it was meaty.
 (laughs)
 Yeah.
 And I washed it down with a Mexican Coke.
 I was so happy.
 Excellent.
 So that was Saturday night.
 Oh my gosh, we watched The Martian.
 We did.
 Talk to me about The Martian.
 You didn't wanna watch it.
 I told you it was a comedy
 because the Golden Globes told us it was a comedy.
 It wasn't a comedy.
 I don't like any thing where there's some lone person floating in space destined to die.
 I mean, that's not really my thing.
 Right.
 And there's not really comedy gold to be found in that.
 No.
 But actually, this was quite funny.
 There was some genuinely funny.
 There's so many clever moments in it, but there's equally stressful moments in it.
 And the cast was superb.
 Fantastic.
 It was easily one of my favorite films I've watched this year.
 Yeah, it was really good.
 I think I could watch it now having seen it once already, so I won't be so stressed.
 So yeah, if you haven't seen it and you like well made movies, I highly recommend the motion. There is some language in it
 That wasn't there, but it's PG 13 13 so they're like two efforts and boy did they use them they did use their two efforts
 Yeah, but you know MJ uses an effort. Oh hey that was once like a week and a half ago
 He said it four times so three okay, so he's he's all rated. He's not PG 13 anymore. No, I didn't even think about that
 anything else about this week that I forgot?
 Um, I helped with them in, in the kids room.
 None of that matters.
 Oh, we have to remember is you love Mario car and all my prayers have come true.
 Okay.
 All right, then.
 I love it.
 All right.
 All right.
 Our main topic for this week is all about fasting.
 Yes.
 And the topic is brought to us by a listener who asks, I'd be interested to hear
 some discussion around fasting.
 I know it's something in the Bible that we're asked to do.
 But if I'm honest, I find it really hard.
 My experience has been that I become so distracted, lacking focus and grumpy with my family while
 fasting that I can't see it producing any good fruit.
 I generally don't feel closer to God while doing it, and I'm not even sure if I notice
 a difference afterwards.
 This all sounds negative, but I expect to have some things to learn, and I'm genuinely
 interested in your experience.
 For example, when would you fast, or any examples of the benefits you've experienced, tips
 for starting out, etc.
 Thank you for sharing so much wisdom, humor, and advice each week.
 I really do find listening to you both so refreshing.
 Well, thank you so much.
 All right, fasting.
 Eighty Jones.
 Yes.
 Where do we start?
 It's funny.
 I guess because I didn't grow up in the church, I didn't really know anything about fasting.
 So when I came back from YWAM, the renewal had just started in Toronto and a friend of mine
 said he was going to start a 21-day fast.
 And I was like, "Well, that sounds fun."
 This is your first experience of fasting.
 Yes.
 I've never even fasted for a day or a meal.
 This sounds like AJ.
 And so I was like, I mean, I'm sure I can do that.
 That's fine.
 And so we did water for 21 days.
 You psycho.
 Well, I didn't know.
 I just did what he did because I didn't know what I was doing.
 And while I was fasting, I read a book called God's Chosen Fast.
 And I think it's written by a guy who's like a doctor who's also Christian.
 And so he's talking about what your body is actually physically doing and how to safely
 restart your body after fasting so that you don't damage yourself kind of thing.
 Well, at least you had that in your favor.
 Yeah.
 So I read that book while we were fasting, but what was funny was we were supposed to be
 doing 21 days and we went to this concert with a bunch of people and somebody said,
 Are you why you guys eating or like what were fasting and like but it's been longer than twenty one days you should be done by now and we did the math and realize we were at twenty three days over a cheaper.
 Yeah so we both we were sitting in Wendy's at the time watching other people eat so we both went and bought a burger.
 And a burger as our first mail back and i thought i was gonna die didn't read the book that said i did i did but i was just like well.
 And it's funny because i wasn't even hungry i mean you stop being hungry after about seven or eight days typically not my experience but go on oh just on water you do what i always have your but let's we've already established your freakish way yes my freakish so you eat a burger and then what happens oh i thought i.
 Thought i should go to the hospital i was i was in agony i just thought my insides were gonna explode it was horrible because everything shut down yes it would there was not ready for anything gluten greasy burger.
 burger bacon cheese.
 Well, heck no, it was, it was bad.
 So don't do that because that's a bad idea.
 All right.
 So now that we started with what you don't do, don't do that.
 Yeah.
 Let's rewind a little bit.
 Yes.
 Last week, we touched on fasting a little bit.
 We like threw out that whole thing from Matthew six where Jesus says, when you fast, your
 father who sees what's down in secret will reward you.
 Right.
 And so straight off the bat, two things, it's interesting that Jesus had an
 expectation that we would be fasting. I never liked that part. And number two, the fasting
 when done properly brings a reward, which is fasting because I'm motivated by reward.
 Yes. As is MJ, who is currently getting a bag of M&amp;Ms for breakfast if he stays in his
 bed through the night.
 Listen, you got to do what you got to do.
 I'm glad we're not talking about parenting and we're talking about fasting.
 Well, we've never had this problem before, but currently he seems to want to get up in
 the middle of the night and cuddle.
 It's like he reaches a light spot and is like, "Oh, I can get downstairs.
 Say, I've had a bad dream.
 Get some cuddles and then come out to bed."
 And it's tricky because when he comes downstairs, he doesn't look like he's had a bad dream.
 He looks happy as Larry.
 But he's so cute.
 He's so cute.
 That little fuzzy duck butt.
 In fact, you did something we haven't done in 10 years of parenting.
 What's that?
 You let him sleep in our bed a couple nights ago.
 Well, to be honest, it was the lesser of two evils.
 It was either walk back upstairs with him for the second time or just let him crawl back
 in bed and I know I can fall asleep.
 And so we just let him come in.
 Yeah, just, you know, you didn't like having his like appendages and very parts of your
 anatomy.
 He, he had his hand on my face.
 If I rolled his way, if I tried to put my back to him, he would put his foot against
 my butt or his hand against my neck.
 I'm just like, don't touch me.
 And if you haven't gathered yet, she can't be touched while she's sleeping.
 And then he talks in his sleep.
 He tells stories and has conversations.
 He sounds asleep and he's and I'm hearing one side of a conversation.
 Yeah.
 And then between that and the noises you make, it wasn't a good sleep.
 I don't remember a thing.
 I'm sure you don't turn.
 Anyway, back to fasting.
 My story to fasting.
 Yes.
 Came out of a desire to hear God's voice.
 Oh, this is how funny the Lord is.
 Yeah.
 I'm a Christian who believes that God speaks, but haven't really heard his voice.
 And so I'm asking, I really want to hear your voice and praying.
 I really want to hear your voice.
 I'm listening to the best of my ability.
 I feel like the only thing I ever hear God say is fast.
 Right.
 Now I've never fasted and I've never heard God's voice,
 but I think I've heard God's voice.
 So what are you going to do in that situation?
 Ignore the thing that you think he's hearing and hope he says something different.
 Try that.
 All I heard was fast.
 So I actually started fasting and I really knew nothing about fasting.
 I read two books, two fantastic books,
 shaping history through prayer and fasting by Derek Prince and the hidden power of prayer and fasting by Mahash Chavda.
 Yeah.
 Never heard about fasting, never heard any of the stories, like in either of those two books.
 And so I was kind of inspired.
 Now, I have a love affair with food.
 So the thought of not eating it did not appeal to me.
 Right.
 But I was just trying to be obedient.
 And I just thought, well, I'm going to.
 I'm going to try fasting and so it started.
 I started all wrong.
 I just nobody told me anything.
 So I just thought I'll wake up in the morning and I'll not eat breakfast and I'll not eat lunch and I'll not eat dinner.
 And then I'll go to sleep really, really hungry and I'll wake up in the morning and it's called breakfast.
 Break fast literally.
 And so that's where I'll start.
 I would not recommend starting that way.
 That is a that is a huge jump and will not produce happiness for you.
 You'll be fasting for sure.
 But everybody around you might want to throttle you if you don't throttle them first.
 Right.
 My suggestion, what I've learned now is just skip a meal.
 Pick, pick any meal.
 You mean when you're starting out, like when you're starting, you've never fasted before.
 Right.
 My advice is have breakfast, don't have lunch and then have dinner.
 And, you know, instead of having lunch, go and be with a Lord and pray or read your Bible.
 That's, that's what I learned to do.
 Right.
 Is you know lunchtime just to excuse yourself and go away and and and pray and you're just saying Lord
 I'm fasting but I want to feast on you
 right and
 Then I by dinner time congratulations you actually fasted and
 Hopefully nobody got injured in the process
 It's true. I haven't been able to do a
 Water fast since we got married really yeah
 The other thing to do skip dinner. That's that's a slightly easier one
 You actually fast for longer if that matters because you're sleeping half the way through it
 But you don't have lunch and then don't eat anything for dinner and spend that time or spend the evening with the Lord
 Go to bed wake up and have some breakfast the collateral damage of you not eating because let's face facts
 If you're not used to it, you do get grumpy because your body doesn't need food. Yeah, and
 You'll be aware of it, but you sleep pretty well when you're fasting. Yeah
 Well, yeah, yeah, I mean
 you do I
 don't have favorite kinds of fasts. I have the least painful
 kinds of fast. Okay. But probably the one I found least painful.
 And if I'm honest, really, really doable in lifestyle is a
 Daniel fast. Yeah. Because you can still, if you go to somebody's
 house or you have to go somewhere, do a meeting at a restaurant
 or whatever, you can just find some vegetables. Because it is
 hard to do that whole fasting and secret while having a life.
 Yes. Right. So you're at work and this business lunch. You don't want to say it well, I'm fasting.
 Right. Because that's that's weird. Right. If somebody, you know, if you've got,
 if you're trying to an extended fast, which I'm not even talking about, but if you are,
 you know, if you're trying to do a couple of days, you've got life to get on with. So
 at Daniel Fast is really, really good. There's two passages in Daniel, Daniel 111,
 where Daniel talks about, he just says, give your servants for 10 days, nothing but vegetables to
 to eat and water to drink. And then in chapter 10, I think is he says, I ate no choice food,
 no meat or wine, touch my lips, and I use no lotions at all until the three weeks are
 over. So, you know, for an extended facet, Daniel fast is a great choice. He did it for
 10 or actually 21 days, either or I think you just asked the Lord, I would start with
 like skipping a meal. And then I'd build up to try and skipping a whole day. If you
 want to start fasting. That would be my encouragement. You can do juice fast where you don't need
 any food, but you have juice. I honestly find those easier than Daniel fasting even juice fast.
 Yeah, well, water and juice. Yeah, because well, again, it once you're about six days in your body,
 I guess your stomach shrinks or whatever, but you stop feeling like, Oh my gosh, I need food.
 And I always felt pretty good on them.
 That's never been my experience.
 Never.
 The whole time I'm fasting, I constantly thinking I want tacos or pizza or chocolate
 or pretzels or churros.
 Oh, my gosh.
 Totally.
 I literally about day six, I can just keep going.
 Wow.
 Yeah.
 Well, the one that we did together was a Daniel fast.
 And I enjoyed it because, like I said, you can have nuts, you can have vegetables,
 you can have baked potatoes, you can, you can kind of really fashion it.
 And by the way, you don't have to fast food.
 You can fast other things, but for me food is like my big thing and biblically.
 You know, some people even fast at food and water.
 You got to be very careful with that.
 And again, I don't have experience of that, but no, I don't either.
 Anyway, fasting is abstaining from food.
 Start small, follow the voice of the Lord and practice it in those ways.
 I would say the most successful fasts I've ever done are the ones initiated by the Lord.
 Yeah, for sure.
 And by successful, I mean, I haven't killed everybody around me.
 right. And there seems to be a grace on it. There's an ease with it. But the grumpiness that
 our listener was talking about, it's real. But the alarming fact for me is it's a great reminder
 how much of my niceness when I'm not fasting is actually me or how much of it is just that
 my grumpiness is actually abated by sugar. Oh, that's a good thought, isn't it?
 Well, honestly, it's like how much of it is me keeping myself alert and distracted by sugary foods?
 Yeah.
 But the grumpiness does fade.
 It does, yeah.
 Talk about hunger strikes as opposed to fasting and why those don't work.
 Well, here's the thing.
 I don't think when I was doing them, I thought they were hunger strikes.
 It wasn't until a little bit later on that I realized it probably wasn't out of a healthy place.
 Right.
 So yeah, I used to fast in the new year.
 So I did like eight years in a row
 and I would fast for the first 40 days of the new year.
 And typically those were water and juice.
 Sometimes they were Daniel, but usually they were water
 and juice 'cause I just found that easier to do.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I would honestly feel really close to God
 and stuff like that.
 But I also--
  </li><li>You and I have such different experiences fasting.
  </li><li>Yeah, I really like fasting.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
  </li><li>I actually have to,
 well, I check with you if I feel like I'm supposed to fast
 just because I think because I have a previous thing
 of eating disorders, I'm quite good at not eating
 if I don't want to.
  </li><li>Talk about that, talk about the cautions
 if you've had an eating disorder.
  </li><li>If you've had eating disorders,
 like I didn't really catch it until my eighth one
 and then the youth pastor at the time was like,
 Hey, can I just talk to you about your fasting in the new year?
 Like I think it's sweet and everything, but I wonder if that's going to, you know,
 trigger your eating disorders that you're trying to get healed of kind of thing.
 And I had already experienced an enormous amount of freedom, but I did love the
 control of not eating.
 Mm.
 There we go.
 So it was, it was definitely hitting something.
 And so I haven't done a 40 day like water, water and juice fast since then.
 And I've only really done Daniel fast really since then, I think.
 But you realize that actually I'm hunger striking.
 Yeah.
 I mean, I wanted information.
 I was like, I want information on what the year looks like.
 And so essentially while I wouldn't have phrased it this way at the time, I was
 like, Lord, I'm not going to eat until I hear something from you about what happens
 this year.
 Wow.
 And in strange enough, the Lord would tell me a lot of stuff about what was going
 to happen.
 He would do that without you fasting.
 Yes, he would have.
 Right.
 But, but you know what I mean?
 Like, so I, I just sort of went, well, you see it works.
 You know, I didn't really think about it.
 Ah.
 Um, so yeah, I didn't realize it wasn't a healthy thing until a little bit later on.
 Let's talk about your thing of like, you would feel the presence of the Lord while you're fasting.
 I know some people who do, I just don't at all.
 It's for me, it's white knuckling.
 It's like, okay, I'm passing.
 I don't feel the presence or the pleasure of the Lord at all.
 Oh, talk to him about them.
 I mean, I did.
 I mean, it was one of while I certainly think the control thing was playing in, I would
 look forward to that 40 day fast at the beginning of the year because I would feel so close
 to the Lord.
 So I don't know.
 I mean, I don't know.
 I don't know what that is, but it just for me was a great way to connect.
 See, my research says that's 50/50.
 I know you're not the only weirdo.
 I know who says that.
 Thanks.
 fast. How many times can you call me weird in my podcast?
 I apologize, but I have heard that from other people like, oh, I love fasting. I
 physicalist to Lord. And then I also know a group of friends, myself included who are like, no,
 that's not my experience. For me, it's really one of obedience. And in terms of reward,
 I don't even know if I feel like people to say, I often feel like the breakthrough after fasting.
 I can point to experiences in my life where I would directly attribute to the times spent with
 the Lord through prayer and fasting, but I'm not even sure if that's accurate. Do you want to know
 that the greatest tangible reward for me in fasting? Sure. I become utterly aware of my need for
 humility. Yeah. In all seriousness, Psalm 35 verse 13, David says this, he says, "I humbled my soul
 with fasting and I don't know of a faster way to becoming aware that I actually need
 God. I get very, very, you know that verse that says, you know, "May the words of my
 mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, Lord of my rock and my redeemer,
 if you get what your psalm is." I become acutely aware of my ungodly thoughts and my
 I'm godly words and I become convicted much faster when I'm fasting, no pun intended.
 So the fruit of fasting, the immediate reward for me is I am acutely aware of my need for
 more humility.
 And I'm like, Lord, I, because I become weak.
 It's like a man called in one sense.
 If I get sick with a cold or the flu, I'm instantly crippled.
 And it's like kryptonite.
 I'm just like, God, I'm just so weak.
 I just need you. - It's true.
  </li><li>No, it really is.
 I'm completely in touch with my frailty
 because it's a danger when we're running through life
 on our own energy.
 We're like, I'm the king of the world, you know?
 And that's just not the case.
 So fasting for me produces that great awareness of,
 oh Lord, I am in need of humility.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>What about revelation?
 Do you get more revelation when you fast?
 Yes.
 Gosh, like I'm doing it wrong.
 What do you mean you get more revelation?
 Help me understand that.
 I mean, like I don't know how I get crazy visions
 and stuff, like the whole reason I went
 into full-time ministry was because that year
 in that 40-day fast, the Lord gave me
 this very specific vision.
 And then three different prophets came up to me
 and told me that vision back,
 which is why I stepped out into full-time ministry.
 So I mean, yeah, I would say I hear more clearly.
 I tend to have more visions and stuff like that.
  </li><li>I'm speechless.
 I'm not allowed to call you free, comparatively.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 No, well, weird is what you were calling me before,
 but free is also kind of, yeah.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>Well, it's funny 'cause that verse I was talking about Daniel,
 you know, when he's fasting,
 he said in the third year of Sire's King of Persia,
 a revelation was given to Daniel.
 Its message was true and concerned a great war.
 The understanding of the message came to him in a vision.
 At that time, I Daniel mourned for three weeks.
 I ate no choice food, no meat or wine touched my lips.
 And so my question is, did he get the revelation because he fasted?
 Or did he fast and then he got the revelation, which came first, the fasting
 of the revelation?
 I don't know, but I do know that Daniel had a lifestyle of both fasting
 and wisdom and revelation.
 Right.
 So, I mean, this is where I have to go in correlation because in the seasons that I have fasted,
 at the same time in those seasons, there has been an acceleration of revelation,
 but I've never really joined the two together. And equally, there's been seasons of my life
 when I haven't been fasting and I get amazing revelation. So it's hard for me to put the two
 and two together. So it's fascinating for me to see you so unambiguously say, "Oh, yeah, yeah,
 Yeah, that's been my experience.
 I'm like, "Dang."
  </li><li>Yeah, now you're making me wanna fast again.
  </li><li>Oh. (laughs)
 Don't put that on me.
 So yeah, there's an increase in humility
 and increase in revelation.
 What about anointing?
 Now, this is where you're gonna go,
 "Yeah, I raised my first person from the dead
 "after I'd been fasting."
 (laughs)
 But no kidding, Mahash Chavda in his book,
 "The Hidden Prayer of Fasting,"
 he talks about raising someone from the dead
 and the power of fasting and that.
 That's the book that got my attention.
 I was like, wait, what?
 What now?
 Wow.
 I just think even the people that I think of that are raising the dead and stuff,
 they have a regular lifestyle of fasting.
 Like you think about surprise and whatever, like they, they talk about the fact
 that they fast on a regular basis.
 Right.
 And so I do think there's something to that for sure.
 Well, it's also biblical.
 Yeah.
 You know, when the disciples try to pray for that boy and the demon wouldn't come
 out and they come to Jesus and Jesus tells them, Hey,
 this kind of only comes out by prayer and fasting.
 You know, his, this is an obvious thing.
 Like, Hey guys, you, you now have the anointing or the power and the, the,
 the lack of what you're looking for comes by prayer and fasting.
 Right.
 But what's interesting is in that episode, Jesus did neither.
 You neither prayed nor did you fast to get the demon out.
 He just commanded it out.
 He still, he still got the demon out.
 Why?
 Well, he had a lifestyle of prayer and fasting.
 Right.
 What he did then prepared him for now.
 I remember watching one of my close friends.
 They started fasting weekly.
 Right.
 And I noticed a huge shift in the power and the authority on their ministry.
 Yeah.
 Um, so as with everything in the kingdom, God's God's not going to lie.
 Yeah.
 The father does reward us for doing these things in, in, in secret.
 It's important to note though, I don't think having said everything we've said,
 I don't think fasting earns you anything.
 No.
 I think what it does is it slows us down and makes us aware of what
 what is available. Yeah. Bill Johnson says this, I don't fast to pay a price. The price
 has already been paid. I fast to refine my focus so that I might more fully apprehend
 all that has been purchased. Yeah, that's so good. Well, that's, you know, Bill just
 Bill Snor's revelation. Right. But I think that's what it is. I think fasting slows you
 down. So you're stationary long enough for God to hit you with a blessing. Yeah, so good.
 I'm going to link in the show notes. There's a, there's a great article I've linked to
 before it's on IHOP, Kansas City's page about fasting. It's the most practical document I've ever
 read about fasting, preparing to fast. Some of what we've talked about already. It's really,
 really good. So that's our thoughts on fasting. If you have any other questions, shoot us a text.
 But why don't you this week just ask the Lord about whether to try fasting and try skipping a
 meal and seeing what happens? Yeah, do that. It'll be fun. You might be like aging. You might get
 get like heavenly visitations and revelation and angels show up and magically feel the
 presence of God or you could just be like me.
 I didn't say it.
 I just force it, feel nothing, but just think I must be good for me.
 Well, that's probably more impressive anyway.
 What's a bit like the people, you know, our neighbor, Britt, who loves working out, who
 works out every single day.
 Yes.
 And enjoys it.
 Yeah.
 Or my friends who run and they're like, I love running.
 Yeah.
 And then there's me.
 I'm like, I know that physical exercise is good.
 Nay required.
 Right.
 I get no joy out of it.
 And so I guess different strokes for different folks.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Is that a saying?
  </li><li>But do you get more like, I don't know,
 brownie points or something like that,
 because you do it even though you hate it?
 Or I just want to know how that whole thing works.
  </li><li>And if I do get brownie points,
 I lose them instantly when I get to heaven going,
 "In your face!"
  </li><li>I'm pretty sure you do.
  </li><li>Tings.
  </li><li>Oh, it's so sad.
  </li><li>I need to fast to be more humble.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>All right, tell us what's coming up.
  </li><li>I need more brownies.
