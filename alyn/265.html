<p> Island and AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes, sir.<br/>
 Episode 265.<br/>
 It is.<br/>
 It's our Christmas episode, the last episode of the year.
 Yes.<br/>
 Merry Christmas.<br/>
 Thank you, Merry Christmas to you.<br/>
 I think we've hit peak Christmas.<br/>
 Peak Christmas?<br/>
 Yeah, you've done an amazing job decorating the studio.
 Yeah, oh, yes.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 And I decorated you, kind of.
</p><ul>
  <li>You did, you did try to get me a Christmas sweater.
  </li><li>Yes, actually, Lindsey picked up a Christmas sweater for you.
  </li><li>Lindsey underestimated how much mess I have.
 (laughing)
 So I put it on and I was like,
 "Yeah, this is sweet."
  </li><li>Yeah, so.
  </li><li>I was speaking to one of our staff
 who was decorating one of our church events
 and she told me that we're supposed to use eps and salts
 for fake snow.
  </li><li>Where do we want fake snow?
  </li><li>Oh, I was gonna put all of the shelves behind us
 and be on here.
  </li><li>Yeah, no.
 thought would be a lot to clean up. Yeah. All right. Well, Merry Christmas. Thank you.
 You look amazing. Does everyone get to see the sweater? The llama sweater. No one will hear
 it because you're away from your microphone. It's a Christmas llama. It's a Christmas llama
 sweater. Yeah. With a weekly catch up to do. We do. But true confession. Yes. We're two
 days after we recorded the last episode. It's true. Because of our scheduling. We want to
 record now, edit now, so we can actually just be off for a couple of weeks. Yes. And there's
 There's lots going on the rest of the week,
 so we need to sort of just get it done.
  </li><li>Make it happen. - Yep.
  </li><li>In the last two days, we went to church.
  </li><li>Yes. - We were in children's ministry.
  </li><li>Yes. - We had a new members lunch.
  </li><li>Yes. - If you're new to Grace Center,
 by the way, if you listen to our podcast,
 you can be coming to Grace Center
 and perhaps you're new to Grace Center, welcome.
 I don't know if you know that we have
 a new members class that is online.
 You can watch it, we'd run it every month,
 you can watch it anytime you want.
 And then at the end of the month,
 we all have a new members lunch.
 We have to meet some of the staff, get to meet one another.
 It's wonderful.
 So if you haven't done that yet and you're coming to Grace Center,
 can I encourage you to do our new members class?
 Yes. So you had new members class.
 New members class today and Monday.
 I taught honor at our school, which I love our this year.
 So good.
 So enjoying our class.
 Yeah. I taught Ephesians online.
 You did with Michelle, you and both of your Christmas letters.
 Nice live call.
 And there's really nothing else to update.
 Is it true?
 Do you want to confess anything?
 I don't want to confess.
 I've got nothing to confess.
 do to. Okay, let me just remind you about what I'm talking about. So on the last podcast, which was only a few days ago, by the way, I brought up my Christmas gift idea.
 Your reckless, absurd idea that would never work.
 That would never work. And right after we were done recording.
 Literally right after I'm turning off cameras in the studio and I can hear the garage door open and fire squealing.
 Then I just fump off.
 Where did you go?
 Pets, mate.
 What did you buy?
 I bought us two guinea pigs.
 And so--
 Again, if you're listening to this,
 our kids know nothing about this.
 Nothing.
 So tell them nothing.
 Don't text them about it.
 Yeah.
 They know nothing.
 And if you're listening to this in the car with your kids
 and they know our kids, please throw them to secrecy.
 Yes.
 So I drove out, and the two were there that I wanted.
 They were still there.
 One was had already been purchased,
 like one of the other ones.
 and bought all this stuff that they recommended,
 the cage, the liners, and all that kind of stuff.
  </li><li>That was your flaw, that was your flaw.
  </li><li>What they recommended?
  </li><li>Yeah, you bought all the things they recommended.
  </li><li>Well, I did. - They were mere amateurs.
  </li><li>I did ask the lady.
 I did say, do they have better cages
 on like Amazon or online?
 And she said, oh yeah.
 And I said, can you hold those two guinea pigs for me
 if I were to buy them and come back in two days?
 And she said, no, we're not legally allowed to do that.
 And I didn't wanna lose the two guinea pigs that I saw
 that are so cute.
  </li><li>We should have brought them down.
  </li><li>It's too cold down here and they'd be terrified
 with all the lights and everything.
  </li><li>Okay, but we will make happen.
  </li><li>We'll bring them up.
  </li><li>You know what, for members, I'm gonna go video them
 and I'll cut it in right here.
  </li><li>Okay, anyway, so I come home from the pet store
 with all the things, the cage, all the stuff.
 And I say to Alan, will you help me bring them in?
 We sent the kids upstairs.
 And Alan sort of grumply helps bring them in,
 not sort of grumpily, grumpily brings the man,
 and he's like, me, putting it together, me, me.
 And we get the whole thing set up,
 and he's maintaining grump until I open the box
 with the first one in it, and then he melts.
 (gasps)
  </li><li>You and I recall us very differently.
  </li><li>Your face was so funny.
 I was like, you would think that there was a precious gem
 or something in there, and I picked him up,
 I held him and you're like, oh, and then I put him down and I picked up the next one
 and give him a little cut on putting down.
 And then Alan is basically he has fallen in love with the guinea pigs.
 I don't think he realizes that they're not it.
 And you can say whatever you want.
 What's his color?
 Not this.
 It's so true.
 It's so true.
 So true.
 The next morning, the very next morning.
 Alan never gets out of bed at six o'clock.
 you're supposed to wake up and like move around six o'clock.
 He didn't get out of bed at six o'clock.
 I'm standing there making coffee and this, this person who never
 exists walks by and I was like, what are you doing?
 He's like, I'm just checking.
 I'm just checking the guinea pigs six a.m.
 You got to bed to come check.
 I don't recall any of this.
 I was like, what is happening right now?
 I can't get you at a bed at six a.m.
 for the children, but you'll get out of bed for the guinea pigs.
 Okay.
 Well, if we're telling the truth.
 And then,
  </li><li>Agee didn't pick up our real daughter.
 Because she was described as by our furry babies.
 I have to go get her and go, "Babe,
 you need to pick up Abby like your legs.
 Do I have to kind of sail a little longer?"
  </li><li>I got there one minute before she was done work.
  </li><li>But if I hadn't come and go on you.
  </li><li>I would totally cry.
 (both laughing)
  </li><li>Agee started calling them our furry babies.
  </li><li>Fur babies.
  </li><li>Fur, oh yeah, okay, well that's way more appropriate.
 I take that back, that isn't an inappropriate thing.
 -Well, we've named them.
 -We called one Boulder Dash on the other Grandmaster Flash.
 -You can switch their names.
 -Or white lightning.
 -No, that's not what we've called them.
 -What have we called them?
 -We've called them Loki and Thor.
 -We're not going to let the kids.
 -Yes, the kids are going to name them.
 -I thought where you were going to go was not that my doughy little face was all excited.
 Was that in the time that you went to go buy them?
 -Oh, no, this is the best.
 I buy them.
 them, come home, we set them up. I leave Allen still in with them.
 And I'm like, okay, whatever, go to this party. I come home three
 hours later. And boyo here has done like, people who spend
 cages and then you know this.
 And you may have fallen and did you know that they like little
 two stacks? We should get them two stacks. We don't have two
 snacks for them. Do you? Does nobody tell you about two
 stacks? Did you know we're only supposed to feed them in this
 amount? And we should feed them in the morning at night with us
 not with the website says, and he's and I was like, dude,
 Last three hours. What did you do? Just read about Guinea?
 I fell into a guinea pig research funnel.
 And I just got lost in it.
 And then we went and like stared at the music.
 Yeah, I'm just sitting in the room so that they get used to it.
 I said, you've got to acclimate them to your present.
 So you just sit there motionless and they just get used to your presence.
 Yeah. And then the next couple of days, I had a really sore neck.
 And I'm like, why have a really sore neck?
 And then I realized it's because I've been lying down and keeping my hand in the cage
 through a hole.
 He stays absolutely still in this awkward position
 so that they'll come over and stay in this van.
 I now literally haven't them eating out with the palm of my hand.
 Yeah, I do.
 And I can pick them up boys before I was a little bit scared.
 They were, I was a little bit scared.
 Well, you pick them up for the first time today.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yep.
 So.
 Angie, I can put their head in my mouth.
 And I don't squirm.
 At last.
 That's a lie.
 And then last night I'm leaving with Kate to go get this glorious sweater.
 And I open the door and Alan is lying on his dummy.
 with his nose practically on the cage, just staring at them.
  </li><li>I'm doing research.
 I'm trying to make sure they're okay.
  </li><li>If that's not creepy, I can't imagine what it is.
 Can you imagine being there,
 they're baby like guinea pigs.
  </li><li>Do they grow to be big?
  </li><li>Yeah, they're gonna be a little,
 probably twice the size of what they are now.
  </li><li>We need a bigger cage.
  </li><li>I know.
  </li><li>I thought that we were gonna move our 14 year old girl
 into this spare bedroom that we have.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I've decided no, it's now gonna become a--
  </li><li>Big guinea playground.
  </li><li>Yep, I'm gonna build them like an amusement center.
 Rillocostor. -He's like, "Did you know we can get them like little tubes to run through
 that they can exercise? Did you know that we can?" I was like... -You know what else we bought them?
 Which I'm really excited about. -A tent. -And a hammock. -Yeah. We bought the hammock.
 Maybe. But what I was going to say is what we've actually bought them is a harness and a leash.
 -We did. -So we take them for a while. -We did. -Do you think we could like put them in your
 handbag and take some places? -No, because they would pee or poop in my handbag. -That's the risk
  </li><li>First camera we're willing to run.
 Put them in your handbag.
  </li><li>Put them in your pocket.
 (laughs)
 Anyway, we have guinea pigs.
  </li><li>The point is, Mr. Bahambug over here
 has fallen in love with guinea pigs.
 I'm not even sure if he's gonna let the children know
 that it's their Christmas present.
  </li><li>I think if I realized that guinea pigs
 are a gateway drug to a dog though.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Because as much as it does do something to you,
 having another living creature that you were responsible for,
 like our family has just grown, I now want a dog.
 I'm gonna have all of those dogs, but now I really want to--
  </li><li>We can't have one, yeah.
  </li><li>Shush now.
  </li><li>No, dog.
  </li><li>I let you have guinea pigs, you can let me have a dog.
  </li><li>Oh, okay, in a couple years.
  </li><li>You heard it first, and I got it recorded.
 And it's gonna be a new year in about two weeks.
  </li><li>A couple years, I said.
  </li><li>Shush now.
 (laughing)
 This week is all about Christmas.
  </li><li>It is.
  </li><li>We're going off the script, off the reservation.
  </li><li>Off the script, we have no notes.
  </li><li>No reservation.
  </li><li>No reservation?
  </li><li>No reservations.
  </li><li>I have reservations.
  </li><li>Christmas, what do you wanna talk about Christmas?
 I don't know. I thought it might be fun to talk about maybe like,
 what was Christmas like as a kid?
 What's our Christmas like with our kids? That kind of thing.
 I realize that Christmas is one big smorgasbord of emotional memories.
 Oh yeah. Like for me, the sights, the sounds, the smells, everything.
 Like I'm getting so excited about Christmas.
 And you're probably it's mince pies that's driving your excitement.
 Well, and the little sausages, many sausages,
  </li><li>You don't know, I've never made you them.
  </li><li>I have had those years.
  </li><li>None of the students know what men's pies are.
 And I was trying to explain it to them.
 And I was trying to say, oh, it's like,
 you know, a pastry field will sue it.
 And they're like, what's sue it?
 And I'm like, yeah, this is not gonna work.
 And then of course they thought it was--
  </li><li>Sue it sounds disgusting.
  </li><li>They're amazing.
 I'm just looking forward to, we've got our dear friends,
 Ben and Sarah Jackson, and there are three beautiful
 daughters coming to be with us for Christmas.
  </li><li>So stoked.
  </li><li>So excited about that.
 Our kids are so excited.
 I just love the whole rhythm and routine and...
 We'll have to tell them not to listen to this podcast while they're driving down or the kids will know about the guinea pigs.
 Okay, well done. Good catch.
 But what I am most excited about is the rhythm and the...
 What's the cold when you're in a church that has a religious...
 Liturgy.
 It's the liturgy of Christmas.
 Okay.
 It's the... For me, Christmas isn't about Christmas day.
 course christmas is about jesus everybody yes is about jesus but the event is like
 for me it starts on christmas eve there's something beautiful about christmas eve i love
 staying at play i love wrapping presents i love stuffing stockings how come you don't really help
 me with wrapping presents or stuff i love you doing all those things and i love playing on my
 iPhone but sitting there well i wrap presents yeah you're so good at it and i love the fire
 I love music and I love the movies and I love just late nights snacking.
 All those hallmark movies that you love watching.
 No, I don't like any of those.
 Yeah.
 But I love that.
 I love, you know, we have a family tradition where every Christmas we get new pajamas.
 You started out for us.
 Yep.
 I love Christmas Eve and then Christmas morning.
 Christmas morning started for me because it was when my parents weren't grumpy, not
 that my parents were grumpy.
 I want to reiterate.
 No, your parents were lovely.
 We had such a routine in our house growing up that like, I was woken up by the sound of
 of Radio Four and my dad's electric razor
 'cause his bathroom, the bathroom kind of
 brought it up against my bedroom.
 So every day without fail for my whole life,
 364 days a year, it would be Radio Four
 and then zzzz and then I would wake up.
 That was my alarm clock.
 On Christmas day, it was the only day of the year
 where all the children would be awake
 before everybody else, obviously.
 We'd have already opened the stocking in our bedroom
 and then we'd gather up what we loved in the stocking
 and we'd run upstairs to my mom and dad's bedroom
 at, I think eight a.m., maybe seven a.m., and we'd all climb on
 with our bed. Dad would pretend to be grumpy. Like really
 would, he would like play this role. Mum, of course, was just
 like, and there would just be this intimate special moment
 where we'd all be, you know, on Mum and Dad's bed, and showing
 each other what we got. And then my mum would go fix
 breakfast. And I think my memory is that we don't have to wait to
 open big presents. Like maybe like make a cup of tea or
 or whatever, grab a bowl of cereal, but not long.
 It was like, come down and then tear open your presents.
 And the main event, which I loved was
 open up all your presents
 and then you just get to play with them.
 And I think what I loved about the day was
 it was non-stop grazing.
 My memory is that there was no limit on anything.
 You could just eat whatever you wanted,
 whenever you wanted, which meant we would always get,
 you don't get them here.
 You would get a cardboard stocking
 with kind of like mesh on top
 and then chocolate bars glued to the stocking shape.
 Mars would do one and Cadbury would do one.
  </li><li>Oh wow.
  </li><li>And I'd probably eat two of those before breakfast.
  </li><li>I have no doubt that you did.
  </li><li>Plus chocolate coins.
  </li><li>I remember, yes, the chocolate coins.
 I remember when your parents used to send
 this care packages of chocolate at Christmas,
 and I remember the first Christmas they did that.
 They sent us like a box, it was probably two feet squared,
 you know, of chocolate, and you ate it all in one day
 and made yourself sick.
 You're like, yeah, but that's a Christmas.
 It's all about you.
 You got to remember like I'd been in Canada
 where you didn't have good chocolate.
 Yes.
 And they would send me Cadbury's buttons,
 the big giant buttons.
 What was I supposed to do ignore them?
 Like just eat like one or two.
 Percy pigs from Marcin Spencer's.
 Yeah.
 OK.
 Little milk bottles.
 No, Justin and Cornflower.
 No.
 Oh, it's just so good.
 You know what I have for this year?
 What?
 I have a proper, like, Christmas pudding
 that you drench and brandy set on fire.
 and it needs you to make me some brandy butter.
  </li><li>I'm sure I can find a recipe.
  </li><li>I already have a recipe.
 I also found downstairs my mom's--
  </li><li>Can you explain to me why you couldn't make
 the brandy butter?
  </li><li>I'm sure it could.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>We'll let them know.
  </li><li>We'll let them know.
  </li><li>I'll make the brandy butter.
 This year you do the stockings
 and we're at the present.
 (laughs)
 But anyway, that kind of the liturgy.
 Is it liturgy the right word that kind of--
  </li><li>Like you know what's gonna happen.
  </li><li>And Saturday, you know, it's not Saturday,
 Christmas day.
 We'd always watch Mary Poppins in the afternoon.
 There'd always be a Bond movie to watch.
  </li><li>Mary Poppins.
  </li><li>As a boy, it was always on British TV.
 Yeah, everybody who's in Britain is nodding and-
  </li><li>We watched the sound of music leading up to Christmas
 and that would be always on TV in Canada,
 but not on Christmas day.
  </li><li>Christmas day, yeah, you'd always have Mary Poppins.
 And then you would have usually some sort of Bond movie,
 but I even remember, as a kid, I would go to Wales
 and I would remember the drive down.
 I'd remember there'd often be snow.
  </li><li>Well, Wales the country, not.
  </li><li>Wales the country, that's right.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I just, I've got such fond memories of Christmas.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And even as an adult, all those memories stay with me
 and they're retriggered by the food and the smell and the,
 and then my mum would have, we would call it a trolley.
 You guys call it a drink car or something?
 You know, it's like, it's maybe a trolley that's maybe--
  </li><li>You like push it out with--
  </li><li>Two feet by one feet and have three.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>And she would just load up and we would all eat dinner
 in front of the TV.
 And the lights would always be dim
 and we'd always have those incandescent,
 like these lights are kind of bright white lights.
 They would be like a soft orange light.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Oh, I loved it.
 I loved it.
 And then the beautiful things you go to bed at night
 and then you'd wake up when you'd have Boxing Day.
  </li><li>Were you?
 Yeah, nope.
 People don't know what Boxing Day is.
 I mentioned Boxing Day here to somebody
 and they're like, what are you talking about?
  </li><li>Day after Christmas.
  </li><li>Boxing Day.
  </li><li>And it would just be more great movies,
 more great food usually left over from the night before.
 And usually if you're in Canada, I don't know if in the UK,
 but in Canada, Boxing Day was the shopping equivalent day
 of Black Friday. - Black Friday, yep.
 That's where all the Boxing Day sales would be.
  </li><li>Right. - But I never,
 you know, I didn't, I didn't, I don't interest in that.
 I just wanted to play with everything I had.
  </li><li>Oh, I would, well, when I was older,
 I would take whatever money I'd gotten at Christmas
 and like plan where I was gonna go for Boxing Day.
 But it wasn't like, like here, you know,
 people go three or four in the morning.
 It wasn't like that.
 You just go at some point in Boxing.
 What was your, you were talking last week about, you know,
 being in therapy, talking about Christmas,
 having this revelation that Christmas was special.
 Even at your, you know, like your childhood was troubled.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But did your dad get it together for Christmas?
  </li><li>Yeah, he always got it together for Christmas.
 And like we would always have Christmas at the cottage,
 but there was guarantee,
 but basically my parents wouldn't scream at each other.
  </li><li>Did your dad come up to the college for Christmas?
  </li><li>Yeah, he always come up to Christmas.
 And he would come up probably the night before,
 the day before and he'd stay maybe two or three days.
  </li><li>Tell us about the cottage.
 The cottage is huge.
  </li><li>The cottage was huge.
 So it used to be a motel lodge.
  </li><li>So not a cottage then?
  </li><li>No.
 So it had, it was made out of big logs and everything
 is all on one level.
 And it had, we still had the hotel room numbers
 above the doors.
  </li><li>Wasn't it like the Maple Leaf?
  </li><li>Yeah, it used to belong to the Toronto Maple Leafs.
 And my grandparents bought it.
 And so it had rooms at either end,
 two long hallways at either end.
 And then the center section was three sort of massive
 living areas.
 It's one area, but we divided into three.
 And so each of those sort of living areas
 would have like two couches, four big chairs,
 a bunch of table.
 Like so that it would, there are huge,
 it's a huge amount of space.
  </li><li>How many people would it sleep?
  </li><li>I think 26.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Yeah, so a lot of people.
  </li><li>Where would you all eat?
  </li><li>We could all fit around the--
  </li><li>A 26 person dining room table?
  </li><li>No, we had two tables, so I think one of them sat
 like 18 and the other one sat, you know, whatever, eight.
 The kids would eat at the big table in the kitchen
 and the adults would eat at the big table in dining room.
 So you knew you graduated when you made it
 to the big table.
  </li><li>And you would be there with who?
 All of your cousins?
  </li><li>All of my cousins, you know,
 aunts and uncles, that kind of thing.
  </li><li>See, my Christmas was just a nuclear family.
 Your family was--
  </li><li>Oh, the best thing was that it was everyone.
 And so we would cut down a tree together.
 There was a tree farm that would keep an eye out
 because we needed like a 22 or 24 foot tree.
 I can't remember.
 It was huge.
 And so we'd go and they'd cut it down
 and we'd all sort of get in between the branches
 and carry it out of the forest and the snow
 and then they'd deliver it.
 You were from Canadian.
 Yeah.
 Were you wearing like tennis rackets on your feet?
 I mean, I have done that.
 I don't think I did it.
 I was joking.
 Are you serious?
 You have tennis rackets, but snowshoes.
 That look like tennis racquets.
 Oh yeah, they look kind of like stuff.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Did you have an igloo growing up?
 No.
 No.
 Just checking all the storytelling.
 But we did hide in ice caves.
 Anyway, it's fine.
 So we would-- and then we put the tree up.
 And there would be strings of lights everywhere
 to get enough lights on this massive tree.
 And my sister Susan is the oldest grandkids.
 She always got to put the star on,
 but also because that person--
 Wow.
 Well, there was a massive fireplace.
 like you can almost stand up inside this bad boy.
 It was a huge fireplace.
 And then there was these huge like cross beam,
 big wooden cross beams.
 And so we'd use a ladder and she'd get up on the cross beam
 and then we would, she would tie herself off
 with like bungee cords or whatever to a cross beam,
 lean towards the tree.
 But the start.
 So she was the oldest grandkid.
 That's why she got to do it.
 Cause it was like, it was, it was, it was, it was.
  </li><li>She lived a long-run life and she died.
  </li><li>It was, it was, it was.
  </li><li>It was okay.
  </li><li>So we all decorated whatever part of the tree
 we could reach it was based on height because there was so many grandkids.
 We put out like crushes and little houses.
 As a child, that sounds lovely.
 As an adult, that sounds intense to have 26 people.
 It was pretty fun though.
 We put on Christmas music or we play a movie and yeah, it was loud.
 It was it was loud and it was fun and we'd be, you know, eating.
 Christmas-y things and cookies and, you know, whatever.
 And then we would have, we always had tortilla for dinner on Christmas Eve.
 I'm sorry, what's tortilla?
 Tortilla was, it's like a pie, but it's meat.
 You get meat pies?
 Yeah, but it's not.
 It's, it's like a French, I don't know why we had tortilla, but we always had it.
 Do you have pastry?
 It does have pastry.
 It's really good.
 It, yeah, it's a, it's a meat pie.
 Why do you call it meat pie?
 Because it's called tortilla and it's like there's something specific about it.
 But I don't know what it is.
 I'll look it up.
 All right.
 Um, but we always had tortilla at dinner and then my mother never would have wrapped the presence.
 And so people would go to bed and I would stay up with mom and wrap presents until late.
 And they'd put everything under the tree and then the morning, the flatures, which are my eight cousins, they're all in one family.
 They're they're Baptist.
 Yes.
 their stockings they got on the edge of their bed, like their parents would sneak in and
 put them down.
 Our stockings never fit in the stocking.
 They would always, my mom would always put clothes, like whatever it was she was trying
 to get us.
 I think it should be illegal to give clothes to children for Christmas.
 Okay, well, clothes is a staple.
 We should talk about that because I've bought some clothes for the kids.
 Did you buy shampoo?
 Did you buy like toilet paper?
 No, but I do usually put socks and underwear in there, stockings.
 I'll grant you socks and underwear, but like utilitarian clothing is not special.
 Well, I mean, MJ, I got him a fortnight sweatshirt because he really wanted one anyway.
 So I'll ease off. But the Fletcher kids all got to open their stockings and I slept with
 Fletcher kids in the same room as me and we didn't. We had to wait and we had to wait. We weren't
 allowed to come out to the main area where Evan and I had our stockings. We weren't allowed to
 to come out until all the adults were awake and had had coffee.
 It was a nightmare.
 That does sound like a, a tribunal wing to happen.
 So you like, you know, and my mom was never an early riser, but it'd be like nine
 o'clock. The Fletcher kids have already opened all of their stockings and are
 playing with things and we're still sitting there waiting for people to have
 coffee. To be fair, that was probably the least abusive thing of your childhood.
 That's probably true.
 But it did feel like a heinous crime.
 It felt horrible.
 And every year we'd be like, mom, please, like, please go to bed earlier and please.
 Like the flutchers are up at seven.
 Can't you just like get up at seven and have your coffee
 and then we can get them at seven 30,
 then we can see what's in our stocking.
  </li><li>Nothing. - No.
  </li><li>Christmas spirit was dead.
  </li><li>So we would do that.
 And then once we were allowed out, we would have,
 we would get to open our stockings,
 which there was always way more than fit in a stocking.
 And then we would have this creamy egg and hash thing.
 and hash thing.
 I know it sounds awful, but it was good.
  </li><li>Of course, for sure, the night before.
 I've been creamy egg hash.
  </li><li>I don't...
  </li><li>Was it runny eggs?
  </li><li>No, no, it's made with hard boiled eggs
 and like a cream sauce.
 I'm not saying I want to remake it.
 But we always have the same thing
 and I can't remember what we would serve it over biscuits.
 There's an item now.
  </li><li>This year's gonna be interesting like in our house
 because traditionally you would make
 your blueberry French toast with brioche bread.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I've heard the kids request my cinnamon
 candied apple French toast.
  </li><li>But the Jacksons will be here,
 so we'll probably do both.
  </li><li>Do both.
  </li><li>And my cinnamon blueberry French toast
 is actually Linley's cinnamon.
  </li><li>God bless Linley Allen for introducing us
 to that delicious thing.
  </li><li>Right, because she was like,
 was our first Christmas, wasn't it?
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>17 years ago.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>And I've made it every year since then.
  </li><li>Oh, it's.
  </li><li>It's so good.
  </li><li>It's very, very good.
  </li><li>But anyway, we would then have breakfast.
 We still haven't opened any presents yet.
  </li><li>No, stop right now.
  </li><li>20 something people, you have to wait for them to be done
 for the dishes to get done.
 And then everybody comes out to the living room,
 you all have your spot that you sit.
  </li><li>This is gonna make me really angry.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>'Cause your grandfather had this ridiculous system
 where one child was a slave labor to go get a present.
  </li><li>Well, it wasn't just one.
  </li><li>And you opened a present one at a time?
  </li><li>Yeah, okay.
 First of all, they were called the Christmas elves.
  </li><li>It's like watching old people fight on a computer.
 Like, smit, smit, smit, smit, smit.
  </li><li>And so the youngest kids always got to be the elves
 unless the present was too heavy.
 And they would bring it over to grandpa
 and then grandpa would read out.
 This one is too Alan from--
  </li><li>Oh no.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I'm not even there and it's causing me trauma.
  </li><li>It would go, it'd get given to whoever
 and they would, everybody would watch as they open
 and then they go, oh that's wonderful.
  </li><li>Oh stop.
  </li><li>And then they get the next one.
 So it took like six hours.
  </li><li>It's horrible.
  </li><li>It was, it took forever.
  </li><li>Yeah, I would probably down for that.
  </li><li>But, you know, it felt like--
  </li><li>An eternity.
  </li><li>One open, like, you know how sometimes
 we open presents, it's done in like an hour,
 and then you're like, dang, that was a lot of money
 that just went like, that was gone.
  </li><li>I literally never feel like that.
  </li><li>Oh, I do.
 So I quite liked it actually.
 And we still, we do a version of that.
 We don't, we--
  </li><li>Well, we do a fast version of that.
  </li><li>A fast version, we don't, and it's not like,
 bring it to Alan, Alan reads it out.
  </li><li>I have a little bit of concern that this year,
 like my son just wants virtual currency, not cryptocurrency,
 not cryptocurrency, but V-box.
  </li><li>Yes, yes.
  </li><li>Right? - Yeah.
 And so I've told him, but I'm worried.
 There's nothing under the tree.
  </li><li>Yeah, nothing.
 Like we live, we have nothing under the tree.
 And he's noticed, he's like,
 how come there's nothing under the tree?
 Because you won't tell me what you want
 and you just want to get virtual things for your kids.
  </li><li>But you won't tell me what you want.
 So I haven't bought you anything
 and I feel as some level of distress.
  </li><li>Well, I've already told you.
 I've already bought things off of my Amazon list
 and things that I want.
  </li><li>That's great.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But still, I know your love language is gift
 and I haven't got your gift.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So I don't, you know, I'm feeling anxious about that.
 I'm also like the day that we're recording.
  </li><li>Ask the police parent for a great idea.
 You've never failed.
 You're amazing.
  </li><li>Thanks.
  </li><li>But also I do feel like the guinea pigs are sort of mine too.
 You're in the same thing.
 I haven't bought you any less.
  </li><li>I remember being a kid and asked my dad
 what he wanted for Christmas.
 And he would say kind of somewhat like grumply like,
 I don't, you know, I've got everything I need.
 And I'm not grumpy about that,
 I'm at that stage of life where I'm like,
 I don't know what I would buy myself.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's like, there's nothing that you need,
 it's just like a, what might be nice?
  </li><li>I do need a second subwoofer in the living room.
  </li><li>No, you don't.
  </li><li>Because one isn't enough.
  </li><li>No, it really is enough.
 Oh yeah.
  </li><li>I think you'll love it when it gets you.
  </li><li>Oh, okay, good.
  </li><li>And I really appreciate you letting me use
 some of your Christmas budget,
 'cause more of like a family gear.
  </li><li>Ah, I know.
  </li><li>Lean forward, you got like something on your eye.
  </li><li>Okay, all right.
 Ouch, okay.
 How many times do you try and pick it up?
  </li><li>No, it's just, it'll be fine.
  </li><li>Mine, more skin.
  </li><li>What do you, did you, you did an epoxy and date?
 Did you have snow, 'cause you were in Canada?
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
  </li><li>All the time?
  </li><li>Do you remember the first Christmas we moved here
 to Tennessee and it was 71 or 72 degrees outside
 on Christmas day and I was like,
 where did we move to?
 It's so hot.
  </li><li>I was gonna say, it's almost our 13 year anniversary.
  </li><li>Yes, two days and two days we will have been here
 for 13 full years, it would be going on year 14.
 That's pretty wild.
  </li><li>Do you, is there any, like you've described your day?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I'm just curious if there's any.
  </li><li>If I haven't finished the day, then we would do food.
 Never mind, it's fine.
 Yeah, gravy.
 All that matters is gravy.
  </li><li>What would you have for dinner, any other weird?
  </li><li>No, we had turkey for gravy.
 For, we had turkey for gravy.
  </li><li>Oh, turkey, liquidize it.
 Or a nice.
  </li><li>For dinner.
 And you know, just your normal vegetables.
 Turnip.
 We always had turnip.
 I would not want to be at your high for the church.
 Okay, but also like the serving of the food, it was grandpa would carve the turkey and put
 it on a plate.
 That plate would get passed down all the way to grandma.
 All the vegetables were run.
 Grandma would serve all the vegetables that it would get passed all the way back.
 There was no iPhones.
 Like what did you do while that was happening 26 times?
 You just talked and laughed and laughed.
  </li><li>Tacked, I'm not tacked and left.
  </li><li>Prepare shoes, I get it.
  </li><li>Yeah, so.
  </li><li>Is there any food now that's nostalgic
 for Christmas for you?
  </li><li>Gravy.
  </li><li>Gravy.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>We have gravy at least once a week.
  </li><li>I love gravy.
  </li><li>Yeah, okay.
  </li><li>We don't have gravy once a week.
  </li><li>You don't think we have gravy once a week?
  </li><li>We absolutely do not have--
  </li><li>Oh, we average gravy once a week.
  </li><li>We have it about once a month.
 Okay, whatever, I make the gravy.
  </li><li>Did you have Christmas crackers?
 I have a whole new house like what we had like crackers and cheese does that count no an oyster. Oh god your family
 The first time I ever met a J family
 They would always like without fail no matter what the meal was it always have appetizer and their appetizers
 Were Triscuits, I don't know if you know what Triscuits are for those of you who grew up in the UK remember shredded wheat
 Imagine some shred wheat, but savory
 Friskits was an appetizer a block of cream cheese with some special mystery
 chutney now fair play the chutney was delicious
 oh my god
 that was part of it like can you make sure the chutney is only on half of that cream
 cheese
 but what was serious i love the chutney before i discovered where the chutney came from
 So there's like, I think mom had the giant cauldron.
 I have no wing of bat.
 She just had these like mason jars that were not dated.
 No, no, no, just like black syrupy, tarlike thing with chunks of yellow, which presumably was mango.
 Yeah.
 And it was just like the slurry.
 I thought it was store bought.
 And then one year I realized that the cream cheese was a year out of day.
 I think she sent you into the basement to find the chutney and never did you have it again.
 That was even the grossest thing.
 The grossest thing was those triscuits, block a cheese, the weird mystery mango chutney.
 And no, the oysters don't go on the chutney.
 No, but they're right next to each other.
 But you had the oysters are only for plain cream cheese, not for chutney cream cheese.
 No, I understand.
 It doesn't make any better because you would have oysters.
 You think, I start.
  </li><li>Smoke oysters. - No, no, no.
  </li><li>Just a 10, just like somebody sneezing a 10
 with a chunk. - Oh no.
  </li><li>I think I spread that on shredded wheat.
  </li><li>You don't know what you're talking about.
  </li><li>Oh I do. - Where are my smoke
 oyster people at?
 I love it.
 I have two tins upstairs.
 Everyone said, "Wow, I just don't have a 10, you know."
 (laughs)
  </li><li>You don't think you should have 10 sardines?
  </li><li>No, those are like little fish bodies.
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
  </li><li>There's no eyes on the oyster.
  </li><li>But he had chunks of flam.
  </li><li>They're disgusting.
  </li><li>They're so good at what you cooked.
  </li><li>Anything else that you would have?
  </li><li>Food wise, we always had pie,
 Scramblewood, him like homemade pies.
  </li><li>And the pies were different than the Tu Tu.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Oh, that's a pie.
  </li><li>So she'd make like, you know,
 pumpkin pies, apple pies.
 There'd be tons of different kinds of pies.
 So you could pick what you want.
  </li><li>But you wouldn't have Christmas pudding
 that you drenched in brandy and sat on fire.
 They did have Christmas pudding with a biggie sauce.
 That's what they called it.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think you're putting.
 Would you have brandy snaps?
  </li><li>I don't think so.
  </li><li>Do you know what those are?
  </li><li>I don't think so.
 I'll have to show you them.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>They're kind of delicious.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Really messy.
  </li><li>I wasn't big into desserts,
 so I was never as interested in that as,
 for example, the gravy.
 Yeah, in case you haven't gathered.
  </li><li>Bear with me.
 That's just a bit from my childhood.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 cocktail stick. Spheres through a slice of tinned pineapple. Then a block of cheddar and then
 a little grape on top. Oh, that is a good gather. That's so gross. No, but again, my
 geez. Now you would take a roast potato, you'd wrap it in foil and it would be a hedgehog
 with all those like, Oh, disgusting. All right, but you'd also get sausages wrapped in bed.
 I have to wait you probably ate that day.
 No, no, it was just a whole thing.
 It was just a decker.
 It was wrapped in file for elegant.
 Oh, hahaha.
 I have for elegance.
 Will you have those like?
 You're picturing my dining room, I guess.
 Okay.
 I'm going to have to have elegance.
 I'm ready.
 (laughing)
 And then there's little weenie sausages wrapped in bacon
 or wrapped in puff pastry, field pastry.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh, that's wonderful.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Oh gosh, and I'm all congested just thinking about that.
  </li><li>Dark chocolate, my dad would always have
 dark chocolate ginger, which I love,
 like crystallized ginger.
  </li><li>I still don't like it.
  </li><li>But I do remember your dad liking it.
  </li><li>Peppermint creams.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Dark chocolate, caramel creams.
 My dad would always want for Christmas
 to box a black magic, which is weird
 'cause he was a devout Christian.
  </li><li>We called them eight o'clock, eight.
  </li><li>After eight.
  </li><li>After eight.
  </li><li>Yeah, different thing.
 Black magic was a selection box of chocolate all
 in robed and dark chocolate.
  </li><li>Oh, in robed.
 I'm surprised you would eat that as a good brethren.
  </li><li>I know, I think you just ignored the name.
 But they were delicious
 and we would always fight for the caramel.
  </li><li>You know what were good?
 Are those--
  </li><li>Finger fudge.
  </li><li>No, no, no.
 They would come in like a red kind of box
 It was like tall like this and they were called matchsticks.
 No carnival or they were all different little toffits.
 Yeah.
 Can't be carnival.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 You'd also get a tin of roses.
 You'd also get a tin of quality streets.
 And at the end of the year, it would be those little yellow round, you know,
 toffee, doils, um, dollars that you love.
 I love them.
 Yeah.
 I need to go.
 You can't really get any of that.
 You can get any of it.
  </li><li>I think it, well, like Publix has a tiny selection
 of some UK, but it's super limited.
 Yes, very sad, the chocolate over here.
 You know, for me, I think one of the things that was
 joyful for me was just my dad's effort at
 trying to hide what we were getting and making it
 so we couldn't guess and that kind of stuff like.
  </li><li>It sounds like he really came alive at Christmas.
  </li><li>He did, he did.
  </li><li>'Cause some of the rest of the year he ignored you
 or he wasn't present.
 It I've yes, certainly.
 Wasn't what you think about Christmas?
 It was that I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I mean, my dad grew up in poverty.
 I don't know if it was that that he could buy gifts.
 One of the things I realized when when it was just dad and me living together,
 when he would give gifts, I was like, Oh, you were paying attention.
 Like when I thought you weren't paying it, I don't know whether he would go like
 if we were in the mall and I saw something that I liked, I don't know whether he
 would go back right away afterwards and go get it and just save it for Christmas or whether
 he wrote a list or something.
 But he would remember things from months and months before and have that thing.
 Like he was great at giving gifts.
 And I think what it said to me was, Oh, I'm known.
 You're paying attention.
 You've noticed what like makes me excited, that kind of thing.
 And granted more, I experienced that more when our relationship was more healed up and he wasn't drinking and that kind of stuff.
 But even when I was a kid, it was like a guaranteed good day.
 I was teaching students last week about boundaries.
 And inevitably, with Christmas coming up, they were talking about boundaries with families and in-laws.
 And right off the bat, I don't know who told us to do this, but it was super helpful advice.
 That when we lived in Canada, we would always do Christmas one year with my family.
 Christmas one year with your family.
 And then Christmas one year with just our family.
 So we got to build our own traditions.
 Yes.
 And then of course life change, events change.
 We moved here.
 We stopped traveling internationally, etc.
 And now we've really been focusing on building our own family traditions.
 Yes.
 And I was inspired by it.
 What was that guy's name?
 Ryan.
 Ryan.
 The perfect teeth.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>That his dad would pray about a gift
 that he was gonna give to all the kids.
 And it might be something like a mug,
 but then he would make them almost like a prophetic thing.
 So each of the mugs would be different for each of the kids
 and they would sit with him and he would speak over them
 as he-- - He would tell him
 what was significant about the mug
 when he was buying for them.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>You got really inspired by that.
 I remember you going, "I wanna do that."
 We didn't even have kids at that point.
  </li><li>Right, I was just inspired by the intentionality of that
 and that was one of the things that he looked forward to
 was what was Dad gonna get as this gift.
 And I thought, I wanna have like some intentional
 things that the kids know.
 This is what we do at Christmas, things like that.
 By the way, I'm not wearing my rings,
 not because I don't still love you and we're not still married,
 but because they keep falling off
 and I realized I haven't put them back on yet.
  </li><li>Well, I just thought of a great present for you this year.
 We're gonna get tattooed wedding rings on your fingers.
  </li><li>I don't want to get tattooed.
  </li><li>While you're sleeping.
  </li><li>Okay, great.
 So the first one that we started was getting,
 everybody gets Christmas pajamas.
  </li><li>Everybody gets Christmas pajamas
 and they open them up on Christmas Eve.
  </li><li>Christmas Eve presents.
  </li><li>They wear them to bed that night
 and they wear them all day next day.
  </li><li>And you wear them all,
 so you know, like I washed them ahead of time,
 then wrap them.
 So everybody's got clean pajamas that they go to bed in,
 they wear all day the next day.
 Everybody's comfortable.
 And so they, you know, the kids love opening up a present
 the evening before.
 And then one of the years, last year was the first year
 we did all matching, right?
 Was last year the first year did we do all matching
 the year before that?
  </li><li>What a little bit of that question is that you think
 I would store that in my memory.
  </li><li>Okay, I hear you just remember it.
 But definitely did it last year because I'm J
 still wearing those pajamas tonight.
 But it might have been, so it was probably last year,
 but I can't remember if we did the year before.
 And this year we've all so done all matching,
 But I'm starting a new Christmas tradition this year.
 Do tell that I didn't talk to you about.
 But here it is.
 I I've bought a couple family presents that are for the week of Christmas.
 So I don't I haven't decided yet.
 I was going to ask you whether we open them like as soon as the
 Jackson's get here, but I thought it their their games and I thought it'd be fun to buy one or two games every Christmas
 Because our kids love they do playing games and I don't want to wait until Christmas day to open them
 Cuz that they'll be overshadowed by all the other gift right and it takes a week out of us being able to play them
 So I thought I would love to have a Christmas break family gift where yay, it's Christmas break
 Let's open the family gift. So what games did you buy?
 Well two of them that were recommended by
 Breton Shaley and then I checked with a couple other people who play with them and they were like they're so fun
 so
 the two that I got are called
 throw throw burrito and throw throw avocado and
 You can play them together or or separate and I don't really know how the game works at all other than
 There's like a foam burrito or a foam avocado and somehow you end up having
 Wars where you throw them at each other. I don't know apparently it's really fun. Okay, okay
 We'll see how I go. I don't know how it's gonna go
 But the feedback has been the rat lifts are like oh my gosh my kids love this game. It's so much fun and
 Lindsey said the same thing and then Lindsey said it's fun even if you're just with your adult friends
 It's such a great game. So I was like all right. All right. We're gonna try it. So that's your new tradition. Yes is a
 Family a Christmas week family game of it genius. Yes
  </li><li>I think if anything else, Christmas Day related,
 oh, you know what, one of the things we would always do
 that we never have done, and I can't think we should,
 is we would always go for a family walk, Christmas afternoon.
  </li><li>You always hated the fact that your mom
 made you go for Christmas walk.
  </li><li>I did, I really hated it.
  </li><li>So you're gonna drag our kids out
 with a bit of a minute, too?
  </li><li>We would drive to Invergary.
 Have you ever heard of Invergary?
  </li><li>Yes, only from your parents.
  </li><li>We'd drive to Invergary, we'd park,
 we'd go for a walk along the water,
 then we'd get in the car,
 or we'd drive to Paulie Ferry.
  </li><li>That sounds cold and--
  </li><li>Yeah, it was cold, cold and damp and wet.
 Your new shoes that you just got would just be like just so that sounds awful.
 I, you know, I remember a lot of my presence for skateboarding related and I could never use them because it was raining or potentially snowy.
 Right.
 That's, that doesn't sound like a good, can you come up with a different tradition rather than like the Christmas walk tradition?
 Yeah, I don't want to do a Christmas walk.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Uh, we'll have to come up with something.
 Are you wanting something movement oriented?
 No, it was a fleet in thought.
 Okay.
 It's okay.
 It's got a doubt with the pro players gone.
 I remember being with
 Caris and Ben, one of the Christmases and and Caris was like,
 and we're going to go for her Christmas walk.
 And I was like, we're going to do what?
 Like, who does that?
 They have dogs.
 See, maybe we got a dog would be walking.
 No, we could walk the, we can walk the guinea pigs.
 Although they're too little for the harnesses.
 They have to grow some.
 They're they're just babies.
 They're tiny.
 Well, listen, we want to say,
 Thank you so much for being with us this year. 2021 has been an interesting year.
 It has been a big year for us. Yeah, it's been a joy for us to be podcasting.
 Yeah. And we love that you've joined us. We love that you're tuning in listening.
 We're praying that you have an amazing restful, encouraging Christmas and you come back refreshed.
 We are going to take a couple of weeks off from podcasting just so that we can enjoy being with
 our family and being with our friends at Christmas and get some downtown. Yep.
 The first episode of 2022 is plan for January 10th.
 Yes.
 So you won't hear from us until then, but we're praying that you have an amazing Christmas vacation.
 Yeah.
 If you would like the show notes, I can't imagine what would be in them.
 Maybe a throw throw burrito recipe for a tear.
 I'm going to look up your friends.
 Weirdness.
 There you go.
 Yeah.
 I'll populate it with stuff.
 It'll be fine.
 I'll be there.

 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 Sharing their life, experience it
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 They talk about faith in God
 And everything under the sun
 If you are a human being
 There's something here for everyone
