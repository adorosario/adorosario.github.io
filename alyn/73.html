 If you are a human being<br/>
 There's something here for everyone<br/>
 Yes, darling. I love it when we freestyle.
 We're not freestyling right now.<br/>
 freestyle.<br/>
 Nope, still not freestyling.<br/>
 Oh, please stop.<br/>
 The love of all that's holy.<br/>
 Please stop.<br/>
 Welcome to episode 73 of freestyling with the Joneses.
 Hello.<br/>
 So the kids were off school this week.
 Yes, they were.<br/>
 That adds a certain gymnast, a quad to the week, doesn't it?
 Yes, it certainly does.<br/>
 But the good thing is we didn't have to do the get up at 6.30 in order to
 get them on the bus thing.<br/>
 No, we just changed all their alarm clocks to 7.30.
 We did?<br/>
 Then we were like running around like headless chickens together.
 I like the headless chicken.<br/>
 I much prefer that than the early awake.
 Well, baby, I got muffins ready for this week.
 So I'm making the morning's work for me.
 You know what? You are a domestic goddess.
 I am.<br/>
 You're wonderful.<br/>
 It's true.<br/>
 I'm looking at our notes for this week about what we did.
 And it's ridiculously short.<br/>
 Oh.<br/>
 That's simply because the week was full, but with simple activities.
 We taught a lot.<br/>
 We did.<br/>
 Well, you did nothing.<br/>
 I taught a lot.<br/>
 I beg your pardon.<br/>
 You just look good.<br/>
 You were the eye candy.<br/>
 I have spent all week, several hours of every day, getting my teaching ready for tomorrow.
 Oh, I don't doubt that.<br/>
 I'm just saying you didn't do any teaching this week.
 No, no, you just did tons and tons of preparation.
 So much prep.<br/>
 I'm you know, I worked out that this week, we have prepared 13 sets of
 teaching for this week. That's kind of crazy. So we're in that season of running, building,
 doing two schools and it's tremendous fun and tremendous joy. This week I taught on
 the Bible. My inner brethren came out. Yes, he did. He came out to play. But he was more fun than
 the average inner brethren, I think. I was going to say you can't say that, but that's fairly
 accurate statement. I know lots of fun brethren people.
 Yes, I had a fun weekend. Tell me about your weekend.
 Well, I got to have girl times a friend and then I went to Elena shower. We're doing her wedding next week.
 Come on, Blaine.<br/>
 And so that was very exciting. All very wonderful women. So love,
 tank full. And then I got to quote again last night to celebrate Stephanie.
 Hey, answer this while you're out just celebrating.
 Yeah, after a week of not teaching.<br/>
 Yeah. Who's looking after the kids?<br/>
 Like some amazing babysitter, probably.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Who the guy was the Scottish accent.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 It does help our kids go to bed at seven.
 It really does.<br/>
 And I mean, I didn't leave that early.
 Well, Friday I did.<br/>
 I left it like five.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 I'll draw to Starbucks tonight to get a nice green tea.
 And as I was driving back, I brought M.G.
 with me and he was looking for the moon and his whole conversation was, "Hello, Moon,
 did you have a good sleep? Hello, Moon, I love you, Moon. I got a bed. I see you tomorrow."
 I was like, "You are adorable." So I was teaching in the school, you were just the
 eye-canned of being super distracting at the back, and then our good friend Steve Long
 was in from Toronto.<br/>
 He was, which was great. Got to have a good meal with him and hang out.
 Canadian Thanksgiving, no less. How do we celebrate Canadian Thanksgiving?
 sushi, of course, as true Canadians do.
 That's right.<br/>
 The only way to celebrate it.<br/>
 Hey, babe, I forgot to tell you about how good the food was at the homestead
 manner.<br/>
 Wait, what's the homestead manner?<br/>
 It's the place we went for Stephanie's birthday.
 Oh, I see gone.<br/>
 And it's like a farm to table place.<br/>
 So it's on a, I think they said 400 acre farm and all of the food is grown
 there.<br/>
 The animals that you eat are from there.
 And the animals are grown there.<br/>
 That's amazing.<br/>
 They're all grown there.<br/>
 So the menu was great.<br/>
 You know, all in season stuff and the food was fantastic.
 Really, really good.<br/>
 That's awesome.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 So Homestead Manor.<br/>
 Homestead Manor.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 I'll let you take me there sometime.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 If you're good.<br/>
 Well, as short as that weekly catch up was, it was a very busy week.
 It was a really busy.<br/>
 That's probably why we have a short catch up.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And our beloved pastor, Jeff Dallers, back from Romania.
 Yes.<br/>
 him and Becky and Christina and our very own Michelle were there and sounds like they had
 an absolute blast.<br/>
 So welcome back guys.<br/>
 Do you know what I want to talk about this week?
 What do you want to talk about?<br/>
 Let's talk about something.<br/>
 I'm shocked we haven't already talked about.
 So am I.<br/>
 And I feel like I say that every week recently.
 Yeah.<br/>
 The topic is healing.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 And I associate Steve along with healing, not just because that's what we have him to come
 in and teach on the school.<br/>
 I'm sorry, am I boring?<br/>
 I'm looking at our poster with all of our topics and thinking we must have talked about this.
 Oh, okay. Shall I start again? I saw Steve long with healing. Yes.
 And I don't think it's just because we haven't come in and teach on healing at the school.
 No, I think it's because of this past time.
 Well, he describes it as his hobby, which is a very good way of putting it.
 Steve for me was the first person I ever saw demonstrate healing. When I lived in Scotland,
 I was a very hungry christian and would read lots of books and there was a church in Glasgow, there still is a church called Glasgow Elam.
 And they at the time had lots of connections with Toronto and so often the visiting pastors would come in there.
 And this is why before I moved to Toronto and knew anybody but Steve Long came over and taught an evening on healing and I didn't know much about healing I knew enough about Toronto to know that probably some cool stuff would happen.
 So, you know, worship is over. Steve stands up and no word of light, his opening line is, hi,
 folks, my name is Steve. I'm one of the pastors in Toronto. It's great to be with you.
 We'd love to teach on healing tonight, but before I teach on healing, I think it would be good if we
 demonstrated that Jesus loves to heal. So, I was wondering, why don't we find the sickest person in
 the room and ask Jesus to heal them and then everybody else should be easy after that? I was
 I was just thinking, I have never heard anybody be so bold.
 And he proceeded to do that.<br/>
 We all decided that the woman in the wheelchair
 was the sickest person in the room.
</p><ul>
  <li>Good tip.
  </li><li>And he didn't even pray for,
 he just said, is anybody never healed anybody before
 but would like to, and two women volunteered.
 And he just told them what to do,
 and lo and behold, the woman got out of the wheelchair.
 And I was like, I have never seen anything like this before.
  </li><li>Amazing, yeah.
  </li><li>And it's kind of weird,
 'cause you usually associate boldness,
 healing with very loud television evangelists. And Steve's not like that. He's super normal,
 wouldn't you say? Yeah, he's a normal kind of dad kind of guy.
 Right, makes dad jokes. Yeah. Says totally inappropriate things without realizing he's saying
 totally inappropriate things. But he's completely down to earth. He's not fascinated with himself
 or his wonderful healing ministry. And has a wonderful healing ministry.
 Yeah, really does. I would say that I've learned almost as much from Steve as I did
 John and Carol about healing. I'd say I learned practice and faith from John and Carol. I mean,
 traveling with them and seeing just miracle after miracle after miracle and just watching
 John and Carol. I mean, John's amazing. If there isn't faith in the room, he provides the faith.
 Yeah, yeah, he does. I don't know anybody quite like that. So I learned and I was kind of thrown
 in to healing, traveling with John and Carol, because people, you know, ministry times would
 often come up and expect you to be able to do what they do, which is horrible because
 I was terribly healing.
 And then, but that statement in itself is quite funny because it really healing doesn't
 have anything to do with us.
 But no, it doesn't.
 It doesn't.
 But it's funny how when people aren't getting healed, we associate that with us and when
 people are getting healed, we associate that with God.
 Right.
 But I mean, you're quite right.
 The truth is my point in saying that is my track record for praying for people and seeing
 them get healed was remarkably low. I'll give you a prophetic word, but if you want healing,
 can I take you over to Carol? And so I had faith that they would heal people. I just never really
 saw it for me. So yeah, I learned practice and faith from John and Carol. I'd say I learned theology
 from Steve. Not that I didn't learn theology from John and Carol, but Steve, you know, wrote two books.
 He's written a bunch of books, but he wrote two devotional books, 30 reasons why Jesus heals,
 and another 30 reasons on something else.
 And there were kind of a collection of distilled thoughts
 I'd heard him share over the years.
 One of my favorite Steve Hunt stories was,
 we did a workshop at one of the conferences in Toronto,
 and I went to Steve's workshop,
 and it was all about deliverance.
 So he taught deliverance, and then he split us up
 into groups, and we all did deliverance on each other.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Only Steve.
  </li><li>Only Steve.
 And he's just like, "Now, turn and command the,"
 and I'm like, "What, this is amazing.
 "I love Steve.
 He just makes everything so super normal.
 Yeah.
 As I mentioned, Steve wrote a book.
 His latest book is called My Healing Belongs to Me and the
 premise of the book and certainly the title of the book is
 something that changed the way I approached healing.
 And I've told the story many, many, many times all over the world.
 But I think the turning point for me from God heals to God wants
 to use me to heal was one Sunday when we went to church.
 Yeah.
 and Steve Long had a friend coming to minister at the church that Sunday. His name is Sam
 Lourby. He's a minister from Ghana and he is a minister in London, I think, or England.
 In London, yeah. And so Sam was in Toronto for a week of healing meetings. And so Steve by
 wave introduction is like, "Hey, good morning, everybody. You know, I've got a good friend of mine.
 Sam Lourby's going to be ministering this morning just so you can understand a little bit about
 Sam and what he's going to be speaking on. I went to pick him up at the airport last night and he
 He nearly didn't get into Canada.
 The customs agent stopped him and the boarder said,
 "You know, sir, what are you doing here?"
 And Sam explained that he's here to do a bunch of meetings
 and he had a ministry team with him.
 And the customs agent said,
 "Well, I'm not gonna let you into Canada
 "'cause clearly her work and you're on a visitors visa."
 He's like, "No, I'm not here at work.
 "I'm just here to do a meeting."
 And she mistook the 26 people for his ministry team
 as a crew 'cause they had video cameras
 to film some of the miracles.
 So she said, "Look, sir, there's two ways to do this.
 You know, one, we don't accept your entry into Canada and you get in play and go home or you pay a fine of several thousand dollars and you can come in.
 But you have to leave all your camera equipment and pick up on the way out.
 So Sam just looks at her and says, you have pain in your body.
 But say how he says it with his accent.
 Well, I don't want to offend the people of the great nation of Ghana.
 Okay.
 You have pain in your body.
 Yeah.
 That's the way he says it.
 Yeah.
 And so he proclaims to this woman that she has pain in her body.
 And to my amazement, she said, yeah, I do.
 And so he said, well, pray this with me, you'll be healed.
 And she did, and she was.
 And she said, welcome to Canada.
  </li><li>And let him in with all this stuff.
  </li><li>And let him in with all this stuff.
 So then it gets into the elevator.
 You know, Steve picks him up and then I said,
 again, to the elevator to go to the parking garage.
 And while they're in the elevator,
 Sam turns to a guy who's in the elevator
 and says, you've pain in your body.
 And the guy says, yeah, I do.
 And Sam says, well, pray this with me, you'll be healed.
 So he prays a short prayer and that guy gets healed.
 Now, at this point, I'm thinking the guy's been in Canada
 less than 24 hours and has healed more people than I have,
 and I've been in Canada at this point,
 I don't know, five years.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I was in this season of my life
 where I was grateful for all the stories I was either hearing
 or all the miracles I was witnessing firsthand
 done at the hands of my friends,
 but I was kind of jealous for some of my own stories.
 I was jealous to see God work through my prayers
 and through my laying on of the hands.
 And it wasn't for the lack of trying.
 And I didn't think it was for the lack of theology.
 Like I think I had good theology about healing.
 I think what I was missing was an expectation of healing.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So Steve drives them to the hotel that he's staying at.
 They check in and while he's checking in,
 he says to the guy behind the counter,
 did Steve tell you the good news?
 And the guy's like, "What?"
 And Steve's like, "What?"
 And he's like, "Jesus loves you.
 "And by the way, you have pain in your body."
 The guy behind the desk says,
 I do have pain and Sam praise from and he is healed and then Steve takes him to the service and that was the night before and when they come back from service several hours later the guy who is buying the desk who got healed.
 I had been waiting for a shift was over but he'd be waiting for Sam waiting to talk to him because the change in his pain was so drastic that he needed to ask some questions and so when.
 Sam walked back in, this guy who's finished a shift, but had been waiting behind.
 And he said, "How did you do that?" And Sam said this amazing thing. He said, "That was Jesus on
 the outside. Would you like Jesus on the inside?" And the guy said, "What do you mean?" And he
 said, "Well, in the same way that I prayed a prayer that healed your body, I can lead you in a prayer
 that will change your life." And so he talked to him about Jesus' death and resurrection. And right
 there, this guy gives his life to the Lord. And again, this guy hasn't even got up to speak yet.
 get this is Steve just doing the introduction.
 And I am on the edge of my seats thinking, who is this guy?
 This guy is amazing.
 You were literally on the edge of your seat.
 Yeah, I was.
 Didn't I just say that?
 No, I mean, like I want people to get the visual because you were like,
 I kind of thought you were going to end up out of your seat.
 Oh, I see.
 So excited.
 You were affirming.
 Yes.
 So Sam gives up to speak.
 And basically he just tells story after story, after story, after story,
 of healings that he's seen and I'm so inspired.
 And I'm, honestly, I remember looking around the room
 going, is anybody else not freaking out
 about how awesome this is?
 And a lot of people just seemed like,
 oh, this is a nice normal service.
 And maybe it was just one of those services
 that was, you know, life changing for me.
 But at the end of the sermon, Sam challenged us
 and he said, hey, you know, you can listen to these stories
 and just think, oh, these are amazing stories.
 But I tell you them so that you will do something
 with them. And he said, if you have boldness, if you have enough boldness to ask a stranger,
 do you have pain in your body, then the Holy Spirit will match that boldness and you will
 find that people will get healed. And I was thinking, "Ah, people get healed because
 you have a healing anointing. People get healed because you have a gift of healings."
 And he, as if knowing that that was the thoughts going through my head, just again reiterated
 that no, this has nothing to do with your healing anointing. It has everything to do
 with the healing that Jesus purchased on the cross. So I felt to myself, I could just leave
 and just spend a lunchtime talking with people about how amazing that service was, or I could
 actually respond to the message and try it and try it. We did. Do you want to tell the rest of the
 story? We were driving home and we had to stop at Walmart to get toilet paper. And I actually wasn't
 feeling well. So I stayed in the car and you went inside and to go get the toilet paper,
 but you were all amped up and ready to give this a shot, but pretty nervous to, weren't
 you? So you saw this lady. Do you want to tell this part?
 Well, yeah, I was so amped up. I thought I can do this. All I have to do is ask somebody
 if they have pain in their body and the rest will follow.
 So I found a Walmart employee and went up to her and said, "Excuse me, do you have any
 toilet paper?"
 I totally checked him out.
 I was so excited to ask her if she had pain in her body.
 But I got my toilet paper and I thought, "This is ridiculous.
 I'm strong.
 I'm confident.
 I can absolutely ask somebody if they have pain in their body."
 And so there was these little plastic tables where people were trying margarine on bread
 him. I just stopped at one of the tables and full of faith shoved a piece of French bread
 with some margarine on it into my mouth, chewed it a bit and looked at the woman and said,
 "You have pain in your body." And she amazingly enough said, "No, no I don't." But I was
 undeterred and like, "Get feelings gone." I was undeterred in my faith. I said, "Yeah,
 you do. You have pain in your body." And she looked at me and said, "No, I don't." And
 in the back of my head, I just prayed this little prayer that was like, "Oh Jesus, you
 know, I help me out here." And just as I said that prayer in my head, I felt pain shoot
 down the back of my leg into my right foot. And so I said to, "Yes, you do. You have
 pain in your right foot." And she said, "How did you know that?" And I said, "Well, repeat
 this with me and you'll get healed." And she said, "What?" I said, "Just say this
 with me and I just jumped into this four-line prayer that Sam had taught us. So I said,
 this healing belongs to me and she repeated it because of what Jesus has done. I receive
 my healing now in the name of Jesus. And so I said, now check your foot. I just doing
 everything Sam taught us to do. And so she kind of stamped around in our foot and squealed
 that her foot was healed. And so she said to me, how did you do that? And remembering
 everything that Sam had said, I said, well, that's Jesus on the outside. Would you like
 Jesus on the inside.
 And this was around the time when Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion of the Christ came out,
 which was great.
 I just said, have you seen Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion of Christ?
 She said, yeah.
 I said, do you know why Jesus died?
 She said, no, I don't.
 And I said, he died so that you could be saved and he died so you could be healed.
 I said, you got half of it.
 Do you want the rest of it?
 And she said, yeah.
 And so right there, and then she repeated a four line prayer that I made up on the spot
 and gave her life to Jesus.
 I checked out, bought my toilet paper and got in the car.
 Shell shocked, I think.
 were so excited. It was really cute, but you were just, I have to call somebody. It worked.
 You know, so you were stoked. So you called Carol and...
 I remember calling Carol and I remember just saying I had it on the speaker phone and she
 was like, "Hello?" And I was like, "I got one!" And she was like, "What?" I was like, "It totally worked.
 I just prayed and led someone to Jesus and healed them in the middle of Walmart." And she just
 thought that was the best thing ever. And what started from then was basically a constant flow
 of me asking random strangers all over the world in almost every conceivable circumstance,
 excuse me, but do you have pain in your body? And almost always seeing people get healed.
 To the point where every time we went anywhere you prayed for people, which was awesome, but also
 required some extra planning because we now had to leave early in my head if we were going to
 stop anywhere on the way to the church or on the way to the airport because for sure you're
 going to ask anybody there if they had any pain in their body and pray for them. So it was quite
 funny. I remember this one time we were late for flight to Australia. Do you remember? Oh yeah,
 I remember because we were flying LA to Sydney. Wasn't it LA to Auckland? Yeah. And we'd left way
 too late and we were checking in.
 And we're trying to check in for the LA, like Toronto LA portion.
 And this lady said something and I thought, "Oh no, he's going to do it.
 We have like 40 minutes to make it to our gate."
 And Toronto, you know, Pearson International is a huge airport.
 And she said something and, you know, sure enough, you know, she said she was a Catholic
 or whatever and prayed for her.
 and she got healed and she hugged you and everything and you let her do the Lord.
 I mean, it was awesome, but I was like so stressed because we had Abby and I was just
 like we're so much luggage.
 So much luggage.
 We still had to have the clear US customs.
 And we had to run, you know, kind of thing.
 And I was just like, wow, well, I'm glad she got saved because we're going to miss our
 flight, you know.
 And then, but then she just took us through this back door and bypassed everything with
 that.
 hand and said, "Come with me," and just left or stand and kind of navigate us through
 in all those well.
 Yeah, we made it.
 So that went on for many, many years, just like on airplanes, in taxis, in different
 countries.
 When we would travel, we would teach groups of people to go and do this.
 We sent people out on the street to do it.
 And it is remarkable.
 What that shifted for me was I knew that God wanted to heal people, but seeing healing
 after healing after healing. I think what that did for me was it shifted the notion that God
 wants people healed and God wants and God wants people saved into a dramatic reality in front of
 me because he backed that up with signs and wonders. Yeah, he so backed it up. People get healed all
 the time. I remember when we were keeping track in the first hundred people that you prayed for
 only two didn't get healed and neither of them would finish the prayer.
 That's right.
 They didn't want to finish the prayer.
 And I was like, well, you would rather not finish the prayer and keep your pain.
 And yeah, they, I think my favorite one was though, in Williams and Sonoma, I prayed for
 a girl.
 And I said, you know, repeat after me.
 She said, okay, I said, this healing belongs to me.
 And so she said, this healing belongs to me.
 I said, because of what Jesus has done.
 She's like, oh, no, you're not one of those Jesus people.
 And she, you know, was clearly upset.
 I was like, yeah, I am.
 She's like, well, I don't want to have an end to do with Jesus.
 And I said, "Really?" I said, "You're halfway through. It'd be longer for you to argue with me than just finish the prayer."
 It's like, fine. So she finished the prayer. And I said, "Check yourself and all are pain and gone."
 And she was like, "How'd you do that?" And I was like, "What's that do to your theology now?"
 But just the notion that, you know, God paid for her healing.
 Mm-hmm.
 And actually, while she was still sinners, Christ not only died for her, but paid the price for her, salvation and for her healing.
 You know seeing stuff like that just taught me like oh god you absolutely
 want to see people healed and so I'm so grateful for Sam Lorby and in turn for Steve who just modeled that so brilliant and
 John and Carol who would go for it and I remember some of the asked
 Sam Lorby, you know, you're out and you see two people who are sick, you know
 Maybe one in a wheelchair and one with you know crutches. How do you know who to pray for a person a or person B
 He said pray for person A and person B and it just demystifies his whole like oh, who should I pray for right?
 It was just you know nobody was safe from a collateral blessing. Mm-hmm. It was funny for me because
 you know, of course you're you're the
 crazy healing praying guy now and
 you know, we pretty much were always together and
 It sort of became my role as it were to be the one that smiled and kind of looked normal
 if the person looked panicked when you said, "Hey, repeat this after me," or, you know,
 whatever, I would just sort of smile and nod and be like, "No, it's okay," you know,
 that kind of thing.
 But I realized I was getting jealous in my heart to have the boldness to do it myself,
 and I was frustrated that I kept backing down, you know, that I kept sort of going, "Oh,
 well, this is Alan's thing," you know, or, "Well, I'll be the sidekick," or the whatever
 And I remember at one point it came to a head for me.
 And I would imagine this was like a year and a half later.
 Right.
 After Sam had been at the church and I had gone down to the church for a conference or for
 a meeting or something.
 And you were home with Abby.
 And I was just like, okay, like as I left the church, I phoned you.
 And I was like, babe, I'm going for coffee with Lindley.
 I'm going to do it. I'm sick of not having my own testimonies. I'm sick of being a chicken.
 I'm going to do this. You can do this. You're awesome. You're going to be great. I was like,
 okay. I remember sitting down and of course, Lindley is totally for it. It's not like Lindley
 would be like, what are you doing? No, of course. But we're sitting in this restaurant and the
 server comes over and I just, I must have three or four times started with, you know,
 do you have any sugar?
 Do you have, you know, and I just never got it said and even when I went over to pay
 the bill, it was just me and the server standing there and I thought this would be the perfect
 time but by then I was so discouraged that I was like, so I didn't say anything.
 Right.
 And I got in the car and I'm driving home and I called you and I just started bawling my
 eyes out.
 I was like, "What's wrong with me?
 Why am I afraid?"
 So I just remember you being super encouraging and praying for me.
 And then I needed to stop and get diapers.
 Well, I think at the moment the Holy Spirit said to me when you were crying, like, "I'm
 just chicken.
 I can't do this."
 I felt like the Holy Spirit said to me, "That's the Holy Spirit.
 That's what tomorrow's for."
 You know, like his mercies are new every morning.
 Yeah.
 And that's what I love about him.
 He's so good.
 And that's what you said, actually.
 It was looking good.
 I'm glad I actually passed on the revelation.
 So I was like, OK, and I think because that took all the pressure off,
 when I stopped to get diapers, I didn't feel like that I have to do
 anymore.
 I just felt this hunger to see the kingdom come.
 You don't mean like see stuff happen.
 And anyway, so I got diapers and a few things and
 was walking up to the checkout and there was like this young girl to check out and I started
 like chanting in my head like no more chicken no more chicken no more chicken and then when I got
 up to the thing you know she's wearing a name tag and whatever and I was just like
 hi do you have any pain in your body and she's like what and I was like oh slow down
 get slower. You know, I was like, do you have any pain in your body? And she's like, I really do.
 And you know, and I was like, okay, we'll repeat this after me. So I said the four line prayer,
 right? You know, this healing belongs to me because of what Jesus has done. I received my healing now
 in the name of Jesus. And so she said it. And then I said, well, could you check yourself?
 And she like bent over and touched her toes and then she just freaked out like,
 This is amazing. I'm pain free and you know, just totally freaked out. And then she turned around
 and she yelled across the entire supermarket. Jeffery, Jeffery get over here. This lady's gonna heal you.
 And I was like, oh no, you know. And so, you know, this guy comes up and he's like 17 years old and kind
 kind of too cool for school.
 Do you know what I mean?
 Like he was just, he walks up and he goes,
 "Hey lady."
 And I was like, "Hi."
 And he's like, "Hey."
 And she's like, "She just healed me and look at me.
 "I can bend."
 And I, you know, you know, I was in pain.
 Look, look, look, I can do, you know.
 She's like, "She's gonna heal you too."
 And I was like, "Okay."
 So I just looked at, you know, Jeffrey.
 And I was like, "Do you have pain, Jeffrey?"
 And he's like, "Yo."
 And I was like, "Where?"
 He's like, "Well, look."
 You know?
 And I was like, "Okay."
 limped over, so it would have been a good guess.
 So I was like, okay, well, just repeat after me.
 So he repeated the four line prayer and he got healed too.
 So afterwards, he jumped on his leg and bent it
 and everything and he's like,
 "Hey, thanks, lady."
 And then he just walked away.
 And I walked to the car on like cloud nine
 and called you from the car.
 I was like, "Baby, I did it!"
 You know.
  </li><li>It is amazing to see things that are in the Bible
 come to life. I think that's the funnest part of walking out your Christian faith. It's not
 that it's an abstract concept, but the promises of the Bible and the demonstration of Jesus
 is to be replicated. And I just love seeing people in our community grab ahold of that and go for
 it. And we had some great healings last week when Steve was here. Mateo had a broken, I think it
 It was broken shoulder, yet a gap, a three inch gap between two bones.
 That three inches.
 And that got totally closed up.
 And just the number of miracles that we've seen throughout the years of people being healed,
 I just absolutely love it.
 And it's amazing.
 And so I'm just so grateful for someone like Steve who is normal and yet just accesses
 the supernatural and makes it super simple for people.
 Yeah, so fun.
 So here's the thing.
 And whenever we talk about healing, it is a diving board into all the questions about,
 "Well, what about this and what about that and why don't people get healed and why I
 pray for my mom?"
 "Well, I did pray for my mom and she died and, you know, what about this and what about
 that?"
 And, you know, it's an enormous topic.
 And I have loved being a student of healing.
 I absolutely love it.
 And I've got many heroes of the faith who've helped me understand a bunch.
 And of course, I still got questions because I'm still novice in this.
 We have two resources. One that you can get right now is called supernatural evangelism.
 And if you wanted to hear more stories about seeing people healed in the street, that's
 available on our website, supernatural evangelism. We talk about prophetic evangelism, healing
 evangelism, presence of evangelism, as in bringing the presence of God into your midst,
 and what is in your hand just using the things that God's given you. But we also have a resource
 on healing that is not available for sale yet because I haven't finished editing it, but it's
 It's a bunch of teachings which will be read in the next couple of weeks on healing.
 So we'll talk about that.
 But there's two resources that I'd really encourage you is one, Steve Long's book,
 My Healing Blunks, to me, we'll put a link to that in the show notes.
 You can get that in Kindle form or you can buy it on paperbacks straight from Amazon.
 And the second thing is a brilliant website run by our dear friend and colleague, Danielle
 Hausen, called Cultivate Boldness.
 And Danielle is an excellent practitioner, not only at seeing people encouraged through
 prophetic ministry, but also seeking people healed on the streets.
 And she's a great trainer and aquipper as well.
 If you go to cultivateboldness.com, you can read testimony stories, watch videos of people
 being healed.
 And I'd really recommend that Danielle's an excellent teacher and I'm so the quipper.
 Are you ready for a listen's question as we say goodbye?
 I believe I am.
 This is from Becky and it's got to be one of my favorite questions.
 Oh, now I'm excited.
 The question is, do you think we still reap the consequences of judgment if we do?
 judge people who aren't actually real. For example, if I'm watching a movie and judge
 one of the characters for something they did, does that count as a judgment?
 That's an awesome question. I would think it probably does because you're still judging.
 Right. It's not the object of the term is whether it's a judgment. It's the attitude of the heart
 that determines whether it's a judgment. Yeah. And a judgment is an observation with attitude.
 Yes.
 So, yeah, you, because here's the thing, if I judge somebody I've never met, if I'm reading
 a newspaper and reading about a celebrity or a politician doing something and I judge
 them, I mean, there's nothing real about them.
 I'm not in their life.
 I mean, sure, they're a real person, but I'm judging their actions.
 I'm judging what they said.
 Right.
 And it's an ugly attitude in my heart.
 That ugly attitude still exists if it's a fictitious person, I would say.
 Yes.
 Well, certainly to be on the safe side.
 But well done Becky if that's the biggest thing that you need answers in your life you are doing
 Well just before we close off I wanted to let you know or just remind you if you
