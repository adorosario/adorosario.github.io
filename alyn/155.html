<p> I'm in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Jones is a j Jones.
 Hey baby, you look very sun kissed.<br/>
 I am.<br/>
 I had way too much sun for Scotsman.<br/>
 Yeah, I mean, you don't look like you've gotten any sun, but you have had sun.
 Like it's not like you're burnt or something.
 No, but I'm kind of like the incredible Hulk.
 Oh, I feel like I've had gamma radiation.
 OK.<br/>
 And on the inside, my cells are reacting like,
 "Stop, I'm a pasty white Scotsman, what are you doing?"
</p><ul>
  <li>Well, as long as you don't turn green, I'm okay with that.
 I'm, my skin is doing a patchy thing, which is interesting.
  </li><li>It's really cool, yes.
 You were very blotchy in the sun.
  </li><li>Yes.
 So that's new.
  </li><li>That's a great look, but once you're indoors,
 it goes away. - It does?
  </li><li>Yeah, you look much better indoors.
 Outdoors, I was a little bit worried.
  </li><li>Oh dear.
  </li><li>But you were having the sun for forever.
  </li><li>I was, and I didn't have any sunscreen on today,
 but I tend to not burn.
 Right. We had our church. Wait, you didn't have Sun Tan on sunscreen sunscreen.
 That's the thing. No, that was not a good idea, Darnie. You're,
 you're a naughty girl. Okay, but I didn't burn.
 Well, whether you're feeling the effects of the sun's radiation on your skin is,
 is quite a different matter from whether you burned your skin received the effects
 with radiation of the sun. Okay.
 I had a remarkable outdoorness today. We had our church family picnic.
 We did. So after church today, we were all in a giant field and there was ice
 screaming inflatables and water inflatables.
  </li><li>And you were in a dunk tank, which I missed somehow.
  </li><li>And I'd like to say somebody came out to me indoors
 and I was reflecting on the fact that there was like
 a lineup of people waiting to dunk me.
  </li><li>Of course you're horrible.
  </li><li>And she said, "Well, colleges do dunk tanks
 "for professors to raise money.
 "And typically it's either the professors that they hate
 "or the professors that they love
 "that have the longest lineups."
 I was like, "Well, let's just hope they dunked me because they loved me."
 And she just laughed.
 So didn't confirm or deny.
 Well, she's a very kind person who I'm sure would never say it was because it
 didn't like tremendous ministry of encouragement.
 You got their mystery.
 One of the things I enjoyed most about this afternoon was the ice cream stand.
 That wasn't ice cream.
 Yeah, it was some sort of ice, wasn't it?
 It was flavored ice, but that sounds gross.
 This was delicious.
 It was so good.
 You would have sworn it was ice cream.
 It was basically just really good sorbet.
 You guys have done this all wrong.
 We've started at the end of our week,
 rather than the beginning of our week.
 I think because we were excited about the ice cream.
 Well, that's true. Yes.
 Yeah. So anyway, we've had a lot of sun because then we came home and went to the pool.
 We did. And that was great.
 And then we ate dinner outdoors and I had breakfast outdoors this morning.
 So I'm goodness. You have really, you have.
 I'm so proud of you.
 Dorker than I am.
 Well, you had sunscreen on.
 Well, I'm glad one of us did.
 Yes, but you just think your vitamin D will be high.
 So that's good.
 Ask me what the highlight of my request.
 What was the highlight of your week?
 Well, in June for Apple nerds, our Super Bowl happens.
 Yes.
 The Apple hosts a worldwide developers conference that I didn't get to go to.
 I actually never been to it would all be over my head.
 But what they do is they stream the keynote address,
 which is kind of dumb down for the public, which I appreciate.
 This year was two hours long and Apple released
 and previewed a bunch of new hardware and new software, which made me super giddy.
 That's very cool.
 Now ask me who have installed the beta software.
 Have you installed the beta software?
 I don't have to ask you.
 I know you have.
 Well, I've matured this year.
 You did.
 Because I've only installed it on my test hardware.
 I haven't installed it on the actual hardware.
 I use really.
 It's not on your iPad.
 It is.
 But, you know, I thank my iPad as my test hardware.
 Oh, oh.
 So what I use today, OK, you're so funny.
 I'm like, I have no idea what test hardware is, but I'm pretty sure it's on something.
 Well, for example, it's not on my current phone.
 I'll wait a couple of days.
 It becomes frustrating.
 Oh, yeah.
 Yeah.
 So anyway, that was Monday.
 I loved it.
 It was amazing.
 So good.
 Yeah.
 Thank you.
 And then Tuesday, you got to go canoeing.
 I did.
 How come I never get invited to go canoeing?
 I mean, you're invited every year and you refuse to go.
 That's correct.
 And I have about 15 really big bug bites on my body from that particular
 canoe trip.
 Yeah.
 Was your 15 bug bites worth it?
 Yeah, it was awesome.
 You're so weird.
 I don't understand it was really good.
 But it did start chucking it down with rain in the middle of the canoe trip and then apparently there was thunder and lightning
 I did hear the thunder. I didn't see the lightning
 So I was the leaky canoe and we just kept going and then turns out afterwards
 There was a lot of lightning that I just sort of missed so that was a bad decision
 But you're making great decisions this week. I don't need sunscreen because I don't burn
 It was only thunder so there probably wasn't any lightning. Well, I just you know, yeah, I'm just living on the edge
 living on the edge
 to dent
 And when it was a fun day, you finished your theology class?
 Yeah, I've been teaching a six week beginner's guide to theology.
 I'd like to overemphasize the beginner's part because I'm by no means a theologian,
 but I do have a passing amateur interest in theology.
 And I see enough bad theology out there that I thought, I'm going to teach six weeks of
 just the foundation so it helps people spot wonky theology faster.
 If you've got any interest in that, you're in luck because I'm going to play the first
 part of that. Oh, good. For this week. Yeah. Okay, good. We'll talk about that in a second.
 But yeah, I got to finish it. Thank you to everybody who came out. I had, I got my test
 results back from my doctor. Are you human? I am. Okay, perfect. Slightly cyborg though.
 No. Yeah, I had gone in seeing a doctor who specializes in like hormones and vitamins
 and all that kind of stuff. And a couple of weeks ago, they took like 14 vials of blood.
 I was concerned they weren't going to leave me any. Don't you need blood to live? I asked
  </li><li>That's the lady that she said I was still okay,
 but she slowed down after that, so that was good.
  </li><li>That's a cyborg part.
  </li><li>But apparently I am very B deficient
 and very D deficient in my thyroid slow.
 So there's stuff to fix.
  </li><li>Aren't you so B and D deficient
 that your lab results came back
 with a warning from the lab?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>This person should not be upright.
  </li><li>Well, like saying stuff like,
 this person is probably dizzy,
 is experiencing tingling fingers, is experiencing neurological, this, that, and the other.
 And yeah, so they, for both of those, I'm so low that the lab sent back warnings.
 So I guess I'm going to do some B shots and we're going to reverse this puppy.
 Wow.
 Yeah.
 Puppies can go in reverse.
 Yeah, they do.
 It's hard, but they can go in reverse.
 It's a little awkward, you know.
 Okay, perfect.
 Yeah.
 So apparently in a couple months, I'm going to feel absolutely amazing.
 Is that why you were all day without any sunscreen?
 Because you're trying to get vitamin D from the sun.
 Yep, that's why.
 Okay. Did the doctor prescribe that or is that just you're an unsan?
 Don't assist me being smart.
 You're a Canadian with sunshine.
 I am.
 And then Tia had her birthday party.
 She did. We had it on Saturday.
 She actually turns eight tomorrow.
 Tomorrow.
 But we had to have her party on Saturday and we had a great time.
 Yeah.
 That little chicken is so excited.
 She is. And we have everything ready for tomorrow.
 "Will I still have to go to Whole Foods and get her special requested cupcake for breakfast?"
 Breakfast is bad.
 Can I have cupcakes?
 And bed?
 Thanks for that.
 And so basically, all of this week has been overshadowed by the fact that I'm getting ready
 to go to Scotland.
 My father's funeral is this week.
 Yeah.
 And so I'm going to be flying up shortly to Scotland.
 So I don't quite know how I feel about that.
 I remember at my mom's funeral when I was lowering or helping lower the casket into the grave,
 I was like, this is so surreal and real at the same time.
 You know what I actually think,
 I don't know if this is appropriate to say,
 but I was like, dear Lord, my mom was really short
 because the coffin was tiny.
  </li><li>Your mom was short.
  </li><li>She was?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Okay, well that probably wasn't.
  </li><li>I mean not like Uber short,
 but she couldn't have been taller than like five foot two.
  </li><li>I don't think in terms of numbers.
  </li><li>Oh, okay.
 She couldn't have been taller than your armpit.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>That's much better.
  </li><li>You're welcome.
 I had mentioned that I just finished a six week course in theology about two minutes ago.
 And this week, you know, we're in this kind of strange phase where we're still semi-podcasting.
 We're not doing a normal podcast just because of all the funeral arrangements.
 And so what we've been doing is we've just been hopping on like we have done, just said
 hello to everybody, talked about our week kind of recap.
 And then we've substituted in a previous teaching that we've done.
 And this week's going to continue that trend.
 you're going to hear is part one of the teaching from the course called the beginner's guide
 to theology. You can actually watch all six of them on YouTube if you want. We'll put
 a link in the show notes for them. But I'm going to play that clip for you in a second.
 But what I wanted to say before we sign off this part is we just want to say thank you
 for all the love and prayers that we've received. This is a really hard season but it's made
 so much easier by the fact that all of you are praying and sending your love and I really,
 really appreciate it. I'd especially appreciate your prayers this week as I head back to Scotland.
 little weird, babe, heading back to somewhere that used to be my home, but I actually have
 to leave my home in order to do so.
 Yeah, and you're a different person than when you live there as well.
 Yeah.
 So it's all just strange.
 But I tell you what, I am quite excited about being with my sisters in the home that
 we all grew up in.
 I mean, we're all now grown-ups, but I don't know whether I just have a Hollywood romanticized
 version of what that's going to be like. But part of me thinks the four of us are going
 to be just laughing our heads off as we're finding things that we completely forgot about
 in the home, like photos and weird things that my sister found in the attic and this
 and the next thing. So I'm kind of looking forward to that. I'm also looking forward
 to getting some good Indian food and of course, visiting marks and spenders. I think I'm just
 going to visit marks and Spencer and just stand in the food aisle and just
 you should get the peanut lime chicken.
 Remember that?
 Like the grilled chicken that they have.
 And then lady, I have a list of the
 prawn crackers.
 Oh, for those of you don't have a clue what we're talking about marks and
 Spencer's is God's gift to the United Kingdom.
 It is a, I guess it's a department store.
 I guess it's a department store.
  </li><li>It is.
  </li><li>But I don't go there for anything other than the food.
  </li><li>Well, they have like a food section that's like
 kind of pre-packaged stuff.
 Well, they have real groceries too,
 but they have like a huge section of stuff.
 Like if you just-- - You've read prepared meals
 and lunches. - And it's good.
 I mean, it's just really good.
 And you can eat healthy and still it's really good.
  </li><li>I'm gonna try and petition them to come to America.
  </li><li>Yes, go for it. - Store it in
 Franklin, Tennessee.
  </li><li>I concur.
  </li><li>They would do so well here.
 they would make a killing.
 You know, Williamson County Moms and Lulu Lemon Sweatpants coming straight from the gym.
 Right.
 Right.
 Oh, marks and spenders on the way home and just be amazing.
 It'd be perfect.
 Yeah.
 And then you're probably going to go to Pizza Express as well.
 Well, there isn't one in Dundee.
 Oh, good.
 Yeah, I'm going to have to go somewhere else for that.
 But I'm going to try.
 Really?
 Bake dough balls.
 Definitely started.
 Oh, dough balls.
 Colleen breast balls.
 Mm.
 Anyway.
 So you have to pray for me for all the other stuff that's not food related.
 Because I'm going to be away, there's going to be no podcast next week.
 It's just going to be too taxing first to put something together.
 But we'll be back to normal, hopefully, doing a regular podcast show the following week.
 If you are interested, you can follow along in my adventures in Scotland on Instagram this week.
 I'm @allyn on Instagram, A-L-Y-N. I'll be Instagram storing the whole trip.
 Well, not the whole trip would be weird to Instagram story, the funeral, but you never know.
 That would be odd. And if you want to follow me as I try and stay sane with three children who
 miss their father, you can follow me too. I want to see your Instagram handle.
 Oh, what is my Instagram handle? It's underscore AJ Jones, I think.
 I've already taken care of the kids though, because MJ said, "I'm not going to miss you,
 and I'm not going to cry because you're bringing me back presence, plural." You didn't say plural,
 but he did clarify, if you just bring me back chocolate, I will cry and I will miss you.
 But if you bring me back a present and chocolate, it'll all be good.
 Well, okay, I kind of don't believe him because the last time you went away for like four days,
 he lost it. So this is a stretch.
 This is your last reminder for this year that applications to SOSL are eight month school of
 supernatural life closed this week. On Wednesday, June 15th, to be precise, is when apps closed.
 So if you've been on the fence, either for thinking about doing first year or second year,
 now is the time to get your application in, head over to graceinner.us/school to get more
 information and to start your application.
 We also just want to thank you guys for being so patient with us as we've been doing something
 different for the last couple of weeks.
 Here's Alan teaching the first session of a beginner's guide to theology.
 And the topic this week is the confidence that we have in the Bible.
 It's a great teaching. I know you're gonna love it. We'll see in two weeks
 So holy spirit we thank you for an evening just thank you Lord for this amazing day where we got to enjoy all your creation
 We got to enjoy
 Just the Sun and being outside Lord. I thank you for this Wednesday evening where we get to come
 We get to relax we get to look at your word and we get to study together and Lord Jesus
 I pray a spirit of peace over everybody who's terrified by the thought of a title of theology Lord
 And I just ask that you would bind up any spirits who would tell us that we're not smart enough
 to know this and that we would just be totally at peace remembering that you are a great
 teacher, Lord Jesus, and that you lead us when we're humbled.
 So we invite you Holy Spirit.
 Would you give us ears to hear?
 Would you give us eyes to see?
 And would you give us an amazing time of fellowship in the Holy Spirit this evening?
 Amen.
 Well, I'm so glad that you're here for the first of six weeks together where we gather
 together for a beginner's guide to theology.
 Now, before we jump into anything, it's deliberately called a beginner's guide because theology
 belongs to the students of God.
 All right, so if we all get to be beginners, we're going to be in a great place.
 I like to think that theology belongs to students of God, not experts of God, because whenever
 we become experts in anything, there is a temptation to believe that we no longer need to learn,
 and that's a dangerous place to be. So personally speaking, I've purposed in my heart
 to always remain a student of God in his ways. And so I'm a beginner too.
 Second thing, I think it was J.I. Packer, I'll talk about Packer later, but I think he said,
 "God said, 'Feed my sheep, not my giraffes.'" So the word of God is not high and lofty,
 it's not unavailable to the lowly. Jesus often said that the kingdom of heaven belongs to children,
 and I want to encourage us if we approach things of the kingdom with tremendous humility,
 we will find it's tremendously easy to grasp the things of the kingdom.
 So that's why I'm talking about a beginner's guide to theology. The second thing I want to talk
 about is why theology is an interesting topic to spend a Wednesday night talking about.
 I'd like to suggest that we want a good grasp of theology because theological mindedness,
 assuming that it's centered on sound doctrine and true spirituality, is the best remedy for
 for the situation described in this verse here.
 In Ephesians, Paul writes this,
 "Then we will no longer be immature like children."
 None of us woke up this morning thinking,
 "Man, I really wanna be immature in my faith.
 "Maturity is the goal."
 And so he's saying, "Hey, if we,"
 and we're gonna read on again,
 if we have an understanding of God's word
 and relationship with Jesus,
 we're no longer gonna be immature.
 We won't be tossed and blown about
 every kind of new teaching. We will not be influenced when people try to trick us with
 lies so clever that they sound like the truth. We don't want to be people who are tossed
 and blown about by every new wind of teaching. We may have an amen on that. Most of what
 passes as new teaching today is repackaged old heresy. But we need to know what the truth
 is in order to recognize a counterfeit. So our goal in these six weeks is not to become
 so attuned to the counterfeit, rather we want to just immerse ourselves in the truth so that
 we can easily tell when something is fake. This is what I say next is the only negative
 thing I'm going to say tonight. So if you think we're going downhill, we're really not.
 But as a pastor, as a teacher, I'm tired of watching people I love by being influenced
 by people who trick them with clever lies that sound like the truth.
 And here's the thing.
 I believe that every one of us, every Christian is called to be a theologian.
 Now, here's the beautiful part about that is you don't have to have a degree to be a theologian.
 You don't have to be a minister to be a theologian.
 You don't even have to be in full-time Christian service to be a theologian.
 We just need to be people who place a high value on God's word and have a humble, teachable
 heart.
 I'm looking.
 We've got lots of people coming in.
 We're going to need some spaces.
 If you've got space next, you put your hand.
 We've got some people looking for spaces.
 If it gets any more crazy, Matt and Tim, do you mind putting out some more chairs if
 we need to?
 All right?
 Perfect.
 Thank you.
 So we're looking at this verse.
 Ephesians 4 verse 14.
 The preceding verses, they say this.
 It says, again, Paul's writing here says, "Christ Himself gave the apostles, the prophets,
 the evangelists, the pastors and teachers to equip His people for works of service so
 that the body of Christ may be built up in the knowledge of the Son of God."
 As a teacher, part of my job is to prepare other people for works of service.
 It's my job to help people get mature in the knowledge of God.
 And so it gives me tremendous joy to spend an evening with you doing just that, starting
 on this journey together.
 But it's not just my job to do that, it's also yours too.
 Look at what Paul writes in 2 Timothy.
 He says, "Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does
 not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth."
 Part of all of our responsibilities as followers of Christ is to be somebody who correctly
 handles the word of God, somebody who is familiar, who's not intimidated by the Scriptures.
 But you might be asking yourself, why would a follower of Christ need to put so much effort into that?
 Because look at the words there, do your best, be a worker, be somebody who correctly handles the word of truth.
 Well, the reason for that is found later in 2 Timothy, and Paul warns one of his leaders, he says this,
 "For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine."
 I don't know if you're aware, but I think we might be living in that time.
 So that time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead,
 to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what
 their itching ears want to hear. They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to
 myths. One of the encouragements I want to give us all tonight is we need to not only
 know sound doctrine but also hold to it. We need to be people who don't turn their ears
 away from truth. Now I don't mean to be critical in what I say, so forgive me if I sound that
 way but there are many in the church and I say this without shame, who don't know the
 truth. What I mean by that is they know bits and pieces of the truth, but with the absence
 of a larger picture of truth and in our postmodern world what ends up happening is we feel the
 gaps of our knowledge with what sounds true. There's a present trend today in our culture
 but certainly in Christianity where we've become very, very man-centered, on woman-centered,
 centered really in our Christianity and it ends up with a well what's in it for me type of thinking
 What that's done is created a vacuum that's actually left us as a church
 Quite powerless and in a superficial state. I'm gonna talk a little bit about that later
 What we've ended up with is for a large portion of the church
 There are too many Christians who sadly cannot tell you for sure what they believe or why they believe it
 And there are too many Christians who actually know very little about the history of the Christian church.
 How many of you recognize this fella?
 This is our dear friend, Artie Kendall, a dear friend of the house,
 and personally has been very, very helpful in my preparation for these next six weeks.
 He's very generously given me permission to borrow liberally from his notes,
 and I want to give credit where credit's due.
 Large portions of my teachings in x6 weeks come from people like RT, another gentleman
 called Wayne Grudem, both of whose theology texts I'll be giving you towards the end of
 this course for further research if you're, if what I've said to you is like, "Oh, I would
 have to know more about that.
 I can direct you to some excellent resources."
 But RT says this.
 He says, "Church history is the laboratory of theology.
 of the past will help us understand the present and face the future.
 So it's worth starting at the start of this six-week journey.
 It's worth asking ourselves, why study theology and not just the Bible?
 Well, I want to suggest two reasons to us.
 The first is it can be really, really easy to learn facts about the Bible and yet miss
 the important principles that lie behind the facts. So for example, we all know the story
 of Adam and Eve. We learned it in Sunday school, we're familiar with it, but knowing
 about Adam and Eve is quite different from knowing about the implications for marriage
 in the family, that Adam and Eve, the reason we have that in Genesis, or the nature of
 sin and temptation, the results of the fall. Secondly, theology, the theology that we
 have today is partly shaped by church history, what RT was talking about. And this, as you know,
 none of us can actually live in isolation from the past. So all of us, we have biases with biases
 we're aware of, and we have biases more dangerously that we're unaware of. And those biases were
 by and large passed on to us by those who lived before us. So if you think about it,
 When you read Romans chapter 4, the Apostle Paul has built his teaching on those who preceded him.
 And that passage he's talking about Abraham and later David.
 So our minds, when we come to read the Bible, have been shaped by great thinkers. Theologians
 often quote Luther and Calvin, but Luther and Calvin quoted Augustine and Athanasius,
 people that preceded them.
 So there's a danger, you know, we talk about this and we're like, well, no, no, no, I'm just going to read the Bible like Paul.
 I'm like, well, that's that's great.
 But the chances are we're still going to have our prejudices and it's important that we understand what our prejudices are,
 how we got them and if they need some correcting.
 So let's start with the elementary stuff. We're talking about a beginner's guide to theology.
 So when we talk about theology, theology literally means the study of God's word.
 Theology comes from these two Greek words. Now we're not going to get lost in Greek and Hebrew
 in these six weeks. We're not going to get lost at all. But for those of you who are interested,
 theology is from theos, which means God, and logos, which means word. Now I don't need to tell the
 the people in this room because you already picked this class out of other ones, that theology
 is not a bad word. I grew up in a church that was very, very word-oriented and not so much
 spirit-oriented. And then I moved to some other churches that were very, very holy spirit-oriented
 and not so much word-oriented. And with the same kind of disdain that the church I grew
 up in, talked about those weirdo-cares manics that just, you know, all they wanted to do
 get drunk and lie on the floor and soak. The disdain that my church bring, I bring and talk about
 those people, I found that when I moved to more Holy Spirit churches, we had a disdain about all
 these, you know, like these evangelicals, all they wanted to do is read the Bible, they've got no
 experience. I'm not sure if you're familiar with biases that exist like that. But theology is not a
 bad word. Once upon a time, it was regarded as the queen of sciences. Fancy that? Just two or three
 centuries ago the greatest minds aspired to be theologians or clerics. Today it's likely
 that better minds aspire to be anything but.
 And the trouble is along the way we've had, forgive me, uninteresting preachers, fairly
 dull theologians and last able teachers where they've moved in where spiritual giants used
 to live. I would love to see this trend corrected. I hope that you get as much fun
 out of going through these six weeks as I've had just putting them together.
 My encouragement is if you think that learning theology does not come naturally,
 I want to encourage you. We have the mind of Christ. We have the very mind of the person that
 we're studying, and if we're humble, God will draw close.
 I'll give you a simple formula here in pictures.
 Sound theology combines both the mind and the heart.
 One without the other usually leads to error, and I joked about the error that I had growing
 up in the church that I grew up in and in some later churches.
 But if we are mind-only, which would have been some of the churches I've spent time
 in, where if we approach the kingdom from a purely intellectual pursuit, the emphasis
 on the intellect can actually be quite dangerous.
 Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 8, "But knowledge puffs up while love builds up."
 It's important for us to understand that our intellect is only one part of our personality.
 And the danger is that intellectual stimulus alone can breed pride, which leads to self-righteousness.
 This was one of the tragedies of the Pharisees.
 They thought that God could be understood by intellectual ascent.
 And the sad part is, as the record in Scripture where Jesus is talking to them and said,
 "You study the Scriptures in vain, and yet you miss the day of your visitation."
 You don't recognize that I'm the person the scriptures testify about wouldn't it be tragic to devote ourselves to an intellectual pursuit of God and miss him entirely
 To spend all our time looking here instead of there
 This is if I'm honest what turned me off from the study of theology
 Because I saw too many people who were speaking about God who never experienced the heart of God
 And so their whole identity seemed to be a race to see who could absorb the most knowledge
 about the Bible to out talk people who had less knowledge of the Bible.
 And it was somewhat nauseating.
 And the tragedy is that we can actually exalt the mind and dethrone the spirit.
 And if we're not careful, we could actually make an idol out of the very thing that's
 supposed to lead us to God. So that's if we lean too heavily on the intellect. What about
 when we lean too heavily on the heart? I see people and meet people, I talk to people who
 are like, ah, I just want Jesus. I don't want the word. And that's ironic because Jesus is
 the word. And so it ends up happening. These people are full of passion. Don't even be
 wrong, they love the Lord, but either through bad teaching or a poor experience in a quote
 unquote word church, they're kind of steering away from that and they're just going, they're
 being led by what feels like God. Being led by what feels like God is really dangerous
 because in essence we're making what we feel more of an authority than God's word.
 And one of the biggest errors I see today is Christians trying to make God in their image.
 They're deciding what God is like based on what they feel is like.
 The trouble is Paul said in this verse, "My conscience is clear, but that does not make
 me innocent."
 So if we're allowing our feelings or conscience to say, "Well, I don't think God's like that
 because it just doesn't feel like God to me."
 Just because you feel that, just because you testified, "No, honestly, that's how I feel
 doesn't mean that we're right."
 And that's what I love about the Bible that we're going to be talking about later today.
 We don't need to let our feelings speak for God.
 We let God speak for God.
 And so if we're not careful pursuing theological advances by heart alone could lead to an overemphasis
 on emotional feeling and ignoring the intellectual side of our personality can lead to false
 pride and self-righteousness.
 I found a fascinating verse in Obadiah 1 and 3.
 I don't even know this verse was here, but it says,
 "The pride of your heart has deceived you."
 Oh, Lord, maybe we just have humble hearts
 and not go into deception.
 So it's important as we're going through these six weeks,
 of course we're using our minds and our heart,
 but it is more important, I might suggest,
 that we bathe everything we learn in humility and in prayer.
 How many of you have ever benefited by watching Christians argue in a Facebook comment thread?
 I'm a Calvinist.
 I'm an Arminius.
 You know, and just go back and forth.
 You're like, "How is this bringing glory to Jesus?
 You guys are fighting."
 And so we want to avoid that.
 We want to be people who are humble and bathed in prayer.
 Artis did this.
 He said, "The best theology will be shaped on our knees."
 Ah, I love that line.
 He goes on to say, "Prayer is the antidote to dullness and intellectual pride."
 So we find that prayer is the vehicle by which our hearts remain sensitive to the Holy
 Spirit.
 You know, part of the nature of God is He leads us to places that sometimes we don't
 comprehend.
 And I think we get into trouble trying to pry out of heaven that which the Holy Spirit
 is not currently revealing.
 And so if we can just settle in our heart that what the Holy Spirit doesn't reveal isn't
 worth knowing, I think we'll stay away from error.
 I say all this, it kind of encourages that in the next six weeks I'm going to do my
 best to not just lean all on our intellect, but also give us something inherently practical
 to do. I don't want this course to be so heavenly minded that it's of no earthly use.
 And I remember what Bill Johnson said. He said, "Bible study without Bible experience is pointless."
 So that's not just a mass knowledge for knowledge sake. Let's use it for maturity so we can know
 God and his word better, not so that we can argue with other Christians better. Be horrible.
 Alright, let me jump into theology. Generally speaking, theology has seven different branches.
 I'm going to give you an overview of them, just as a tour guide to say, "Oh, this is some of the
 places we could be going, and then we'll jump into our topic for this evening." The first branch of
 theology I'm going to talk about is Revelation. Now, this is not about the last book of the Bible.
 This is talking more about the inspiration of the Bible. So, this branch deals with the
 The word of God and the word revelation comes from the Greek word meaning unveiling.
 It means to unveil what is hidden.
 And so this branch is all about the way God has revealed himself in the Bible by the Holy Spirit.
 And there's a sense that the word revelation and scripture are used interchangeably.
 The second branch is cosmology.
 I could make a joke, but I won't.
 It's like, how to put on makeup and that sort of stuff, okay?
 It's not cosmology deals with creation.
 Comes from the word cosmos and logos.
 It's the study of creation.
 So this branch partly deals with the question,
 did God create the world?
 Was there some intentional design
 or did it just evolve and happen by chance?
 The third branch is anthropology.
 deals with the whole topic of us, you and me. It's the study of humankind. So it partly
 deals with a similar overlap to cosmology was man created or did we evolve? It also
 deals with important questions like is the human race fallen? Is the human just body
 and soul or are we body, soul and spirit? And topics of human psychology would fall underneath
 that.
 Excuse me, number four, soteriology.
 This is the study of salvation.
 Now in case you're thinking, there's a lot of big words in this class.
 This is as large.
 This page has all the big words.
 After this page, it's easy peasy lemon squeezy.
 So this is all about the study of salvation or the study of redemption.
 Again, words can be used interchangeably.
 And this is probably the widest area with which we'll play in over the next six weeks.
 things like atonement and justification and faith and law, that sort of stuff.
 Number five is numeratology, the Holy Spirit, all the study of the Holy Spirit.
 And so this talks about things like the gifts of the Holy Spirit, the anointing of the Holy Spirit,
 are the gifts still available for today? Or was there a great cessation? Did the gifts stop the last
 to the apostles. Stop me if I'm going too fast. Number six, ecclesiology. This is the
 study of the church. So all of church life is discussed in here, things like baptism,
 the Lord's Supper, issues of church and state, church government, can women be church leaders,
 All that sort of stuff is generally discussed in that branch.
 And then the last one is eschatology, which is all about the last days.
 So things like the second coming of Christ, prophecy, judgment, heaven and hell.
 And we'll do that when the kids join us because they love that topic.
 Now we're going to talk about the blood of the lamb children.
 Are we okay?
 (laughing)
 Now here's the thing,
 we're not going to go through all seven of those in part
 because we only have six weeks in part.
 That is a massive topic to get through.
 But we are going to visit some of them stopped by
 and I am going to give you, like I said,
 at the end of the course,
 a bunch of really, really accessible resources
 that will go into more depth
 than you could possibly imagine about any of those topics.
 The topic I do want to talk about tonight
 is all about the word of God.
 Now, for a number of reasons,
 I think this would be a great place to start,
 but primarily I can't think of a better foundation
 to look at than to talk about the Bible,
 because the Bible is the very books
 that we're gonna use to guide us
 through the remainder of the weeks.
 And so, if we're not sure on the Bible,
 everything else is gonna be a little bit shaky.
 So it's gonna be the foundation that we use.
 Guys, welcome, pick up a flyer at the back, come in and find a seat wherever you are.
 So good to see you. Sorry for calling you out. Everybody looks this way. Nothing's happening at the back.
 Ha ha ha, everything's fine. You know, an assumption in historic Protestant evangelicalism,
 of which we're all a part of, is that the Bible is the word of God. So like, I grew up never, ever
 doubting that the Bible wasn't completely true. However, there's an emergency of something
 called neo-orthodoxy. Now, I apologize. I said, there's going to be no more big words. I'm
 pretty sure that's my last big word. So neo-orthodoxy literally means new orthodoxy and new orthodoxy.
 It was championed by people like Carl Bath and Emil Bruner in the early part of last
 century. So after the First World War, this kind of came around and the kind of growing
 thought was kind of a more liberal thought that, well, parts of the Bible are true.
 Parts of the Bible are inspired. The problem with that kind of thinking, of course, is
 no one really knew for sure which part of the Bible they were talking about. So the
 The end result of this theology was that, well, God for sure spoke through the Bible,
 but we never really clearly defined which parts he was speaking in and which parts were just
 allegorical.
 Fast forward to today, and there are some very prominent teachers who have gone further
 to claim that, well, now that science has disproved the Bible, there are parts of the
 Bible that don't hold up well to scientific criticism, so we can safely say that those
 parts of the Bible can't be trusted. Don't get me wrong, they're good parts of the Bible,
 and they're helpful and everything, but we can actually have confidence that the Bible is true.
 They would still claim that they're followers of Christ, but they would also claim that part
 of the Bible, they're just stories, perhaps beautiful poetry, mere allegories found within this
 beautiful writing that do have value for spiritual matters, but they're not real descriptions of
 real events and they're not applicable today. What that means, starting with neo-orthodox,
 in moving on a more liberal theologies, is it gives us, if we believe that, license to be
 selective about which scriptures we believe in. For example, one of the theologians had
 taught about a meal-bruner. He didn't actually believe in the virgin birth.
 Some of the more contemporary people I've been talking about, I just was listening to podcasts
 the other day so that Genesis really is no more than a poem and you know these weren't
 real people. If we begin entertaining those thoughts it leads us to this question. If
 we can't trust part of God's word how can we trust any of God's word? And that's the
 important question I want to look at tonight. Now before we begin, in case you've just
 joined us and you've heard me say a whole lot of stuff, you're like, wait, are we at
 the right place? I absolutely believe that the Bible is infallible. And what I mean by
 infallible is this definition, the belief that the books of the Old and New Testament
 as originally written were without error in what they affirm.
 Now, you'll hear me talk about inerrancy and infallibility.
 They're interchangeable terms.
 Now, a couple of statements just to help put some boundary lines up
 to what we're talking about, and then we'll just jump in and explore stuff.
 It's everybody good by the way, I forgot to check.
 You're all quiet, is it hot in here, is it cold?
 It's time always too hot, so I'd make it colder if I could,
 but you didn't bring your winter jacket,
 so that wouldn't be kind.
 So a couple of statements to help
 just kind of shore up this definition here.
 I would be confident in saying that scripture
 in the original manuscripts does not affirm anything
 that is contrary to God.
 So there's nothing in the Bible that is contrary to God.
 I would also say that the Bible always tells the truth
 And it always tells the truth concerning everything it talks about.
 Now, let me just clarify that statement.
 That does not mean that the Bible tells us every fact there is to know,
 but it does affirm that what it does say about any subject is true.
 You with me so far?
 You're like, Alan, there's not enough pictures for this. I'm sorry.
 You try finding clip art for theology.
 In this statement, the belief that the books of the Old and New Testament was originally written were without Aaron, what they affirm.
 What that means is all the words in the Bible are God's words.
 What that means is to disbelieve or disobey any word in Scripture is biological steps,
 is to disobey or disbelieve God.
 Again, just to be very, very clear, what I'm saying is that all words in Scripture are completely true
 and without error in any part. Now, this, so funny, every generation faces a crisis of this statement.
 And so the crisis I'm seeing among my peers, a crisis is people who are just like, "Well,
 I'm not sure that's true. That is not a new crisis of faith. It's the old trick that
 that was played time and time again.
 We're gonna look at some resources as well.
 Dr. Michael Eaton said this,
 "In erancy means that when all facts are known,
 the scriptures in their original autographs
 and properly integrated will be shown to be totally true
 in everything they affirm,
 whether that has to do with doctrine or morality
 or with the social, physical or life sciences."
 Now that is a bold claim.
 But I hope you're going to see it as a true claim.
 The reason why I'm confident it's a true claim
 is because look at what this verse says
 in Psalms 138 verse two.
 The Psalmist writing says,
 "For you, speaking of the Lord,
 have magnified your word above all your name.
 The Bible is God's integrity who on the line."
 If the Bible is not completely truthful, neither is God.
 And that means the foundation of our faith is at stake.
 The most common fruit that I see from people questioning in the inerrancy of Scripture
 is falling away from their faith.
 That doesn't happen overnight, but it makes sense.
 If we're doubting what the Bible says, then how can we have confidence in what Christ
 says, "The only source for the truthfulness of the Christian faith is the Bible." And
 all we believe about Jesus stands or falls in proportion to the reliability of Scripture.
 One of the things we teach on the school is whenever you get a prophetic word, it has
 to go sifted through the Word of God. The Apostle Paul said, "Even if an angel appears
 and preaches something contrary to what we taught you, or preaches another gospel, let
 them be eternally damned.
 With this people out there who are having "visitations from the Lord, telling them
 things that are contrary to Scripture, and they're fantastical and they're amazing,
 but they're false."
 Similarly, at the other end of the spectrum, from the spiritual over the intellectual,
 there's intellectual debate and intellectual talk that's coming to the same conclusion,
 albeit without the supernatural.
 Gonna, well, is it?
 So it's important that we settle it in our heart regarding the reliability of Scripture.
 Let's let the Bible talk for itself for a second.
 I'm going to go through a bunch of verses and I'm going to read them out.
 I've written them down for you can go back and read them in your own time.
 In the Old Testament, 2 Samuel 7, 28 says that God cannot lie or speak falsely.
 O sovereign Lord, you are God, your words are trustworthy and you have promised these
 good things to your servant.
 Numbers 23-19, God is not a man that he should lie nor a son of man that he should change
 his mind.
 Does he speak and then not act?
 Does he promise and not fulfill?
 About Psalms 12 verse 6.
 the words of the Lord are flawless like silver refined in a furnace of clay. Or how about
 Psalm 119 verse 89, your word, O Lord, is eternal. It stands firm in the heavens. Proverbs
 30 verse 5, every word of God is flawless. Then in the New Testament continuing the theme
 that we just talked about that God cannot lie. Titus 1 verse 2, it says, "A faith and knowledge
 resting in the hope of eternal life which God who does not lie promised before the beginning of time."
 Or Hebrew 6, 18. God did this so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible
 for God to lie, we who have fled take hold of the hope offered to us may be greatly encouraged.
 Again, the Old Testament and the New Testament are testifying that God cannot lie.
 Continuing the theme that God's Word is fully reliable is Matthew 24 verse 35,
 the words of Jesus who we follow said, "Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away."
 John 17 verse 17, Jesus is declaring that the Word of God is the ultimate standard of truth,
 "Sanctify them by the truth. Your word is truth." 2 Timothy 3 16. Paul is including the Old Testament
 here where he says, "All Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking,
 correcting and training in righteousness." 2 Peter, verse 1, says, "Above all,
 you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophets' own interpretation.
 for prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried
 along by the Holy Spirit. 2 Peter 3, 16, almost done. This is the apostle Peter claiming or endorsing
 that the words of Paul, he's recognizing by the Holy Spirit, but their scripture, he says this,
 he writes, speaking about Paul, he writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of
 of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand which
 ignorant and unstable people distort as they do the other scriptures to their own destruction.
 Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, is recognizing, hey Paul's writings and the other scriptures,
 he's holding them together. Also in 1 Corinthians 14 verse 37, Paul writes this, if anyone thinks
 he's a prophet or spiritually gifted, let him acknowledge that why I'm writing to you
 is the Lord's command.
 Elsewhere, you're probably familiar with what Paul says, he's writing and he says, "Hey,
 I, not I, but the Lord, say this, or I, Paul, not the Lord."
 And he's making this distinction, but the distinction is, "Hey, everything else that's
 written that is not me saying, 'Hey, this is my opinion,' is actually the Lord."
 In 1 Timothy 5, 18, this is for free by the way, it's not up there, Paul quotes Jesus's
 words as found in Luke 10 verse 7 and refers to them as scripture.
 So there is a brief summary, but a fairly exhaustive survey of some of the verses in
 the Old and New Testament testifying in the Word of God that the Word of God is God's
 Word.
 Now, for those that believe the Bible, this is very helpful and very comforting.
 For those that don't, this is an example of what we call circular reasoning.
 So circular reasoning is, well, I believe that scripture is God's word because it claims
 to be that.
 And I believe it's claims because scripture is God's word.
 And I believe that it is God's word because it claims to be that and so on and so forth.
 You understand the problem with that?
 So for those of us who believe, we're like, "Oh, I'm so encouraged by the reading of that."
 To anybody who's skeptical is, they're just like, "Well, that's just circular reasoning."
 The Bible says it's a God word, and so you just expand me to believe that.
 Circular reasoning at its finest.
 Now here's the thing.
 It absolutely is circular reasoning.
 However, that shouldn't actually concern us because all arguments for an absolute authority
 must ultimately appeal to that absolute authority for proof.
 You with me?
 Let me see that again.
 All arguments for an absolute authority must ultimately appeal to that authority for proof.
 Otherwise, that authority would not be absolute or a highest authority.
 You see? For those of you who are like, "I don't see." Let me give you some examples.
 The problem of circular reasoning is not unique to the Christian who is arguing for the authority
 of the Bible. Everyone either implicitly or explicitly uses some kind of circular argument
 when defending his or her ultimate authority for belief. You're like, "Aun, give me an example.
 All right, let's talk about reason.
 Well, my reason is my ultimate authority
 because it seems reasonable to me to make it so.
 (audience laughs)
 Or for those people who just, for the man in the room,
 no offense, who loves to just rely on logic.
 We say things like, well, logical consistency
 is my ultimate authority because it is logical to make it so.
 Or, for those people who want to refuse authorities,
 "Hey, I know there can be no ultimate authority
 because I do not know of any such ultimate authority."
 Unfortunately, in making that statement,
 you've made yourself the ultimate authority.
 Or how about this one?
 But the feelers, the findings of human sensory experiences
 are the ultimate authority for discovering what is real
 and what is not, because our human senses
 have never discovered anything else.
 Thus, human sensory experience tells me that my principle is true.
 All of those are circular reasoning.
 So let's take the question at face value.
 Are there errors in the Bible?
 Because critics who would say that the Bible is not infallible or not in Aaron will point
 out some things that are, see these inconsistencies, and say, hey, see, there are some errors.
 Now, hopefully, we're not in that camp.
 We realize that the Bible says, "No, the Bible always tells the truth, and it always
 tells the truth concerning everything it talks about.
 And in areas where we feel confused about that, we're actually called to put more faith in
 the Word of God than anything else trusting that it will become so."
 But here's the thing.
 I mentioned this before.
 The definition that I've used for the infallibility of Scripture does not mean that the Bible
 tells us every factor is to know about any one subject. For example, the Bible does not
 talk about Wi-Fi and yet there is Wi-Fi, right? But it does affirm that what it does say about
 any subject is true. Here's some edge case scenarios I want to talk about. The Bible can still be
 and Aaron can still be infallible and still speak in the ordinary language of everyday
 speech. What do you mean now? Well, let me give you some examples. This is especially
 true. This statement here that the Bible can still be an Aaron and speak in the ordinary
 language of everyday speech is especially true in scientific or historical descriptions
 into facts or events.
 So for example, the Bible can speak of the sun rising because from the perspective of
 the speaker, this is exactly what's happening.
 So for example, I have a 10-year-old daughter, I have a 7-year-old daughter and a 4-year-old
 son and every morning we have a lemon plant that we're trying to grow lemons on because
 I don't know, maybe that's cheaper than you're going to Whole Foods.
 I'm not quite sure why we're trying to do that.
 But every morning they open the back porch and they walk out and they say, "Good morning,
 and he snick it.
 And depending on what time they get up and say, good morning,
 Abigail might stand on the back porch and say,
 hey, daddy, look, the sun is rising.
 Now I could be very, very scientifically,
 well, actually it's not.
 It's the earth rotating around its axis
 and as we turn towards the sun, we enter its light.
 Now that's hopelessly pedantic
 and I'm gonna exhaust my child every time I correct her
 with that, but we all know what we mean
 by a sunrise and a sunset. This also applies to when we think about numbers in scripture.
 If a reporter claims that 8,000 men were killed in battle without implying that they've actually
 counted every number, we're okay with that. Yes? If roughly 8,000 men were killed, it
 would be false to say that 16,000 people died that day, but it wouldn't be false in most
 contexts to say 8,000 people were killed that day when actually 7,879 were killed or 8,113
 were killed.
 The limits of truthfulness would actually depend on the degree of precision implied by the
 speaker and expected by the hearers.
 You with me?
 Same with measurements.
 I say, "I don't live far from my office, or I just live down the road from my office,
 or I live five minutes away from my office, or I live a mile from my office, all four
 statements or approximations to some degree of accuracy."
 It should not trouble us then that the Bible is absolutely truthful in everything it says
 and yet uses ordinary languages to describe natural phenomenon
 or give approximations or round numbers
 to describe things when they're appropriate in context.
 In erincy, infallibility has to do with truthfulness,
 not with a degree of precision with which events, events are reported.
 Does that make sense?
 The Bible can still be an errand and still include loose or free quotations.
 This is an important one. Now the reason I point these out is if you spend some time online people
 be like, "Ah, the Bible is not without error because of X," and they'll pull up some examples
 like this. I'm giving the arguments against it. In American written culture, we put a person's exact
 words in quotation marks, right? So when we're reading, if we're reading a newspaper article,
 of a "Rina Maxine" article and they're quoting a politician, they will put the exact words
 in quotation marks. When there are no quotation marks, we only expect an accurate report of
 the substance of the statement. You say, Alan, give me an example. All right. I'm at home and,
 you know, my four-year-old is like, "Daddy, when is Mummy coming home?" And so I call AJ and I say,
 "Hey, AJ, where are you?"
 And she says, "I'm at the bank and then I'll be home."
 When I say to my son after I hang up,
 and he's like, "When's I'm gonna come home?"
 And I said, "And I say to my son,
 "Mummy said she'll be home in five minutes.
 "I'm actually making an acceptable
 "and truthful report of AJ's statement,
 "even though I didn't include any of her original words."
 Are you with me on that?
 I'm not deceiving my son, I'm not lying to him.
 Now why do I use this example? Because the written Greek of the time that the New Testament
 was written had no quotation marks or equivalent kinds of punctuation.
 Let me say that again. So the Greek that the New Testament was written in that was being
 translated into English that we read, they had no quotation marks or equivalent kinds
 of punctuation and an accurate citation of another person needed to include only a correct
 representation of what that person said. There was no expectation that you had to cite every word
 exactly. So when the Old Testament is quoted by Jesus in the New Testament or by the New Testament
 writers, the only expectation of that day was that the content wasn't false to what was originally
 stated. You with me so far. So when Jesus is quoting Isaiah, or when Paul is quoting
 Old Testament writers, people will be like, "Aha! It's not the same as what it was in
 the Old Testament." They missed the worder. That wasn't the goal. The goal wasn't copying
 word for word verbatim. The goal was, "Are you accurately representing what was said
 by Isaiah or by the Old Testament prophets.
 Dr. Michael Eton, who quoted earlier, he said this, "There's hardly a single exact quotation
 of an Old Testament verse in the New Testament."
 And critics of Scripture would be like, "Ha, this proves that it's not infallible.
 See, there's a mistake there.
 No, there's not a mistake.
 They're using free or loose quotations.
 It is no more of a mistake for me to say, "Mommy said she'll be home in five minutes,"
 than the fact that my wife said, "Oh, I'm at the bank, and then I'll drive home."
 I'm translating the content of what was said appropriate to the hearer.
 We get a little bit technical here, but I'll include it anyway.
 The Bible can still be an errand and still have unusual or uncommon grammatical constructions
 in the Bible.
 I don't want to get into detail here, but some of the writing in its original language
 in the Greek and Hebrew and some places the Aramaic, some of the language in scripture
 is super elegant and very stylistically excellent.
 Other writings are really rough reflecting ordinary people talking at the day.
 And the point is people would point out, ah, it's not very elegant speaking.
 But it's not about grammar, it's about truthfulness in speech.
 Have you ever watched an interview with somebody who's from a different part of the country
 or perhaps a different social standing than you're used to being in and they're getting
 a testimony from the person, maybe an eyewitness from an accident and perhaps they're using
 colloquial slang that you're not familiar with but you can still get the gist of what
 they're saying?
 You don't think just because they didn't phrase it the way you would that they're lying,
 correct?
 It's the same thing that you find in here.
 Excuse me while I call.
 Number four, this is a big one because people jump on this one.
 I'm just warning you, the Bible can still be an errand and have errors of translation.
 Alan, how can that be?
 Isn't that incongruent?
 Well, when we're talking about an errand seat, we're talking about the original autographs.
 Now, Alan autographs, what are you talking about?
 Somebody signing an autograph?
 No, the word autograph refers to the original copies that were written.
 So the copies that we have that are English Bibles are translated from are ancient.
 They were copied from scribe to scribe.
 And so the comment about the Bible being Aaron is the original copies that the Lord spoke
 out there in Aaron.
 No translator is infallible.
 You might have noticed from my slides or in your notes that when I'm quoting a verse,
 not only am I putting the Bible that I have used in there, but also the version of that
 translation.
 Why would I do that?
 that because on Sunday I was listening to Jeff and he quote a verse and said it was the
 NIV and I looked at my NIV and he was like, "That's not what my NIV said."
 And I was like, "I bet you he's using an older revision."
 So in my Bible software I opened up, I read the NIV 2011 edition, I opened up the 1984
 edition and there it is, word for word, what he had.
 Now if you didn't know he was using the 1984 edition you'd be like, "Hey, are you trying
 to pull a fast one past the Jeff?
 Like what's going on here?"
 But let's take the new international version, for example.
 There are three versions of that.
 It was first issued in 1978, it was updated in 1984,
 and it's been updated again in 2001.
 And there's some passages that you can bring up
 and you can look at them.
 And what's happened is as bodies of scholars
 have worked along as new earlier autograph,
 as new earlier, like when the Dead Sea Scrolls were found,
 it was amazing for all these Bible translators
 because they were far older than any of the previous
 original works that they had to copy from.
 So as translayers get together and realize,
 oh, okay, in light of this new material we found,
 we've updated these things.
 Some Bibles, well, let me just comment
 on the INIV for a second.
 There are subtle changes in the translations.
 Let's just take the INIV.
 There's subtle differences between the 1978, the 1984,
 2011 as better source materials arrive. Some Bibles, like the living Bible or the message
 or the passion translation, are paraphrases. And so the solution to avoiding errors is
 to read multiple different versions of your Bible. By all means read versions translated
 by one person. By all means, read translations that are easy to read, but study those versions
 translated by a committee. That makes sense? Everybody's still okay. Guys, it's so hot in here.
 I'm burning off so many calories speaking, and I can't tell from your face if this is okay. Like,
 am I going too fast? Am I going too slow? Are you like, do a Sean Connery impersonation,
 lighting it up. Okay, I can't tell. All right.
 Ah, m'ch, money penny.
 All right.
 As you can imagine, there are some significant problems with
 denying biblical inerrancy. Let me talk about the consequences
 of these problems here. The first one is, and this should be
 obvious is that several moral problems now confront us. For example, if we are not confident that
 the Bible is truthful and yet the Bible says that God cannot lie, well clearly he can because
 the Bible is not truthful. So may we now lie? If we're told to be imitators of God, for example,
 in Ephesians 5-1, if we deny the erancy of Scripture, we have to conclude that God intentionally spoke
 falsely to us in some things, so now we're free to do the same thing.
 Another issue is we begin to wonder if we can really trust God in anything he says.
 Since we've become convinced that God has not always told the truth in some matters,
 Even minor matters in Scripture.
 We then logically have to come to the conclusion that God is capable of speaking falsely to
 us.
 This will have a significant effect on our ability to take God at His Word.
 We would be entitled to ask questions like, "Well, why should we trust Him completely?
 Well why obey the rest of Scripture?
 Why hold on a promises or prophecy?"
 Number three, third problem with denying an errand says, and this is the scariest one
 for me, is we make our own human minds a higher standard of truth than God's word itself.
 When we use our minds to pass judgment on some section of God's word and pronounce them
 to be an error, we are saying in a fact that we know truth more certainly and more accurately
 than God's word ever does, or than God ever does.
 And that poses some significant problems.
 By the way, this is the root of all intellectual sin.
 I think I quoted this a while back when I was speaking at church, David Campbell's brilliant
 line.
 If you do believe the parts of the Bible you don't like, but you do believe the parts of
 the Bible you do like, you don't believe the Bible you believe yourself.
 Number four, if the Bible is wrong about minor things, then it is inherently wrong about
 some major things too.
 See, this is the slippery slope. It's not a slippery slope, it's an open doorway to hell.
 But if we are saying, "Oh, well, this isn't true, right, if this isn't true," just by
 saying one part of the Bible isn't true, we've actually nullified a core truth that the Bible
 is God's Word. A denial of inerrancy means that the Bible's teaching about the nature
 of Scripture and the truthfulness and reliability of God's word is also false.
 So then we're not actually concerned about minor details, we're concerned about major
 doctrinal concerns in Scripture.
 For those of you nervous that I've got my phone out, don't worry, I have now decided
 that I'm doing something about the heat because I'm about to pass out.
 So huddle together for warmth if you need to.
 Tragically it says it's set at the temperature I want to add.
 So we're just going to do a kick start or we're going to take up an offering right now for
 new air conditioning.
 All right.
 Preferably one that doesn't go when it starts.
 All right, I got a bonus one.
 I read this last night and thought, oh my gosh, you need to add that.
 So you don't have it in your notes.
 This is number five.
 This is this for me was like, Lord.
 In Matthew 22 verse 29, Jesus meets the Sadducees.
 Now the Sadducees were kind of the baby liberals of their day.
 When I mean liberals, I'm not talking about political party, I'm talking about liberal
 theologians, right?
 Because they didn't actually believe in the resurrection.
 All right, so they held to a lot of teaching, but not just a small part called the resurrection.
 And so Jesus looked at them in Matthew 22 verse 29 and he said to them, "You are mistaken
 not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God."
 Here's my point.
 Once you deny the inerrancy of the Bible, you don't have any basis for your teaching.
 And what happens is your life loses the power of God because it's not based on the word
 of God. If the Bible, if what the Bible says is not what God is saying, how can we ever
 live a life full of authority and life transforming ability? It would be very clear if we deny
 the Bible, we deny God's power.
 All right, let's turn the corner and land this plane.
 You know, I'm encouraged.
 I'm by the way, you know, I'm all for the intellectual pursuit of God.
 I'm all about the emotional pursuit of God.
 Absolutely.
 I think you have to have both, as you heard me say earlier, you end up on one ditch or
 another.
 But I'm encouraged that in our pursuit that we have to leave our confidence of our own
 intellect.
 We absolutely have to.
 God gives an intellect and it will take us so far.
 At one point we have to be like the father whose child was harassed by a demon.
 We said, "I do believe, help me overcome my unbelief."
 So if you're struggling tonight with what I'm saying, you're in great company because
 because God has tremendous mercy on people who are not like,
 "Ah, I don't believe and it's wrong.
 Ah, you've got to pose as the proud,
 but he gives grace to the humble."
 If we can go like, "God, I do believe,
 how am I overcoming my unbelief?
 How am I, you know, I'm struggling with this part
 or that part?"
 God has mercy on people who are humble.
 And so I want to help us with this question,
 how do we believe the Bible is the word of God?
 If there are all these consequences
 of denying biblical inerrancy,
 and our whole goal is to pursue Christ
 for the rest of our days, this is a major thing we have to have settled.
 So how do we believe the Bible is true?
 Let me give you two ways to do it.
 The first I'll tell you right now isn't as effective as the second.
 But the first is the objective witness.
 What do you mean?
 Well, let me tell you and then tell you why they're not that helpful.
 The first one is what we've looked at tonight.
 What does the Bible say about itself?
 Read the Bible's claims for itself.
 The reason why this is not that helpful, and I say that in inverted commas, because anytime
 we read the Bible it's going to be helpful.
 But from a purely logical outside perspective, what the Bible says about itself is the whole
 circular reasoning that I've talked about it.
 The second thing is archaeological confirmation.
 That's helpful.
 I've met some people.
 It depends on how you're wired.
 Some people are like, "Oh, that's amazing!"
 As archaeological digs, as we find more cities that the Scriptures talk about, as we find
 the Dead Sea Scrolls, as we find other things, and we're working together, it's like, "Oh,
 shockingly enough, this confirms what the Bible's been saying for years."
 The trouble with that is, archaeological confirmations are limited at best.
 The third thing is testimonies of those whose lives have been blessed by the Bible.
 So you know, people all the time who just didn't want to do a God but they had a praying
 grandmother and they just couldn't deny what the way that their grandmother lived a life
 the way they absolutely devote themselves to teaching the Bible and it did something for
 them.
 The trouble is testimonies have limited appeal.
 And then lastly, there's this deductive reasoning, what we've been trying to do tonight, and
 we're skimming the surface.
 Like there's tones written about this.
 Here's why deductive reasoning sometimes won't help certain people.
 I don't know who said it, but maybe you can tell me.
 A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still.
 So for the objective witness, that's number one.
 That does help.
 I've seen that happen.
 help people. But number two, the second thing that's really going to help us is the internal
 witness of the Holy Spirit. And I say that because the same Holy Spirit who wrote the
 Bible lives within us and testifies that it is reliable. Look at 1 John chapter 2 verse
 26. It says this, "I am writing these things to warn you about those who want to lead you
 astray. Guys, not to scare you, there are people who want to lead you astray. They're not indifferent,
 they're not casual, they want to lead you astray. But the confidence here says, "But you have received
 the Holy Spirit and He lives within you. For the Spirit teaches you everything you need to know,
 and what He teaches is true, it is not a lie. So just as He has taught you, remain in fellowship
 with Christ. That is 1 John chapter 2 verse 26 to 27, and I read it from the New Living
 Translation to 2nd edition. 1 John 2, 26 and 27. Here is the ultimate issue. This is what
 it boils down to, is conviction must rest higher than reason. The same theologian,
 that could not believe that Jesus was born of a virgin because it was medically impossible,
 believed that he was going to be raised from the dead, which is also medically impossible.
 You can't have it both ways. So at some point, like,
 we, we, reason will take us so far, as Graham Cook says, "God is much too clever to be an
 intellectual." But conviction must rest higher than reason. By the way, everything we believe
 does not make sense to the rational mind. I mean, we've forgotten about it. The trouble is salvation
 is an offense to the mind. The cross of Jesus is an offense, but until we get to the other side
 of that offense, it's no longer offensive to us. It makes total sense. But it's the same with the
 inerrancy of Scripture. We have to cross that line and actually trust that God is who he says he is,
 Otherwise, we will be unstable in all our ways.
 And here's my encouragement to you.
 If I could encourage you with anything, it is the best way of discovering the Bible's
 reliability is to get to know it and trust it.
 The Bible proves itself as you go along with the Bible.
 So a life lived in accordance to the Bible demonstrates the Bible.
 You will very swiftly get to the point of knowing what is true and what isn't because
 the Holy Spirit will not deceive you.
 Here's the thing, if you have confidence that the Holy Spirit will not deceive you, you have
 confidence that the Bible will not either.
 I grew up in a church that I am so grateful for.
 It had such a high value on the word of God that from an early age we would read it around
 the breakfast table before we go to school.
 I hated it.
 I appreciate it when my parents were doing for me.
 But what that did was just give me this internal barometer
 for deception.
 Like when someone is preaching
 and it is not the word of God, I'm like,
 (squeaking)
 without even knowing why often my intellect
 has to catch up with my spirit.
 The more we immerse ourselves in scripture,
 the more we will realize that what's in it is true
 and what it claims for itself is true.
 So there we go.
 Our conclusion of week one is that biblical inerrancy
 means that whatever the Bible affirms us true is true.
 And whatever the Bible affirms us false is false.
 Now I wanna give you something as a part and gift.
 Please don't confuse what I've just said there
 with interpreting the Bible.
 Interpretation is a completely different issue.
 So you have to have it settled in your heart that the word of God is the word of God before
 you try interpreting.
 What do you mean interpret?
 I mean, try and understand what this verse means.
 I like it said this way.
 Everything in the Bible is literally true, but not everything is true literally.
 Let me say that again.
 Everything in the Bible is literally true.
 not everything is true literally.
 For example, Jesus said, "I am the vine, I am the door."
 But no one looks for doorknobs or hinges
 or leaves or branches coming out of Jesus' ear.
 You understand what I mean?
 So the latter, don't worry about that,
 that's interpretation.
 That's like, hey, is this Old Testament poetry?
 Is this Old Testament prophecy?
 Is this the Gospels?
 Is this the book of Acts?
 Like you read things and you interpret things
 according to how it was written.
 That's a whole topic for another session,
 but people often get confused between the two.
 What I wanna leave you with is the encouragement
 that God's word is a lamp to our feet
 and a light to our path.
 If we are followers of the word,
 it only ever brings us closer to Jesus.
 If you are doubting the word, take stock of your life.
 Has your doubting led you closer to the Lord
 or further away from him?
 If it's the latter, get your lamp and your light out because we're going to use it in
 the next five weeks that we have to get, I can't speak, we're going to use it in the
 next five weeks that we have together to discover more of what God says in theology.
 Let's close in prayer and then I'll dismiss you to the great outdoors.
 Lord Jesus, we just love you.
 We love that you saved us from an empty way of life.
 We love that you rescued us from the pit.
 We love that you've given us a glorious hope.
 We love that you've given us the Holy Spirit.
 And Lord, we love that you've given us the Word.
 And Lord, I ask that for all of us here tonight, Lord, that there would be an unreasonable
 passion for the Word of God, that we would find just because of your grace and your
 mercy, that you would deposit in our heart a supernatural hunger.
 So not just read, but obey your word.
 And what I ask that we would be known amongst other things that Gray Center is a Bible devouring
 church that we love our word and that we're committed to sound doctrine.
 So I ask you Holy Spirit, would you come?
 Would you bless every person and their family that's represented here?
 Would you give us a deep love and a deep conviction for your word in Jesus' name?
 Amen.
