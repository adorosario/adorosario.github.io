<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is Mrs Jones.
 Yes sir.<br/>
 You don't look a day over forty five.<br/>
 Thanks, Dorothy.<br/>
 Today's a j's birthday.<br/>
 It's true.<br/>
 And I'm not a day over forty five.<br/>
 That's right.<br/>
 So you know exactly forty five.<br/>
 And you look amazing.<br/>
 Thanks.<br/>
 I got so many likes on my Instagram post of you looking
 and resplendent and transfer to the Ytukovir.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah, it was a great photo that you posted.
 You should probably just post more pictures
 of me and get more likes.
 I'm pretty sure that's what we learned from today.
  </li><li>That is the lesson.
 So it's your birthday, any wisdom for us youngens?
  </li><li>The Bay Area Elders.
 (laughs)
 I'm like, that would get me the most distance
 for the next couple years.
  </li><li>I said to the kids today, they're trying
 to guess how old I was.
 I was like, well, how old do you think I am?
 And they're like, well, you look younger than you are.
 I said, oh, okay, well, how old do you think I am?
 You're 35.
 I said, you have a mummy and they're like, it's 45.
  </li><li>Which child is that?
 I'm writing them out of the will.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>All through them.
 So you've been away all weekend.
  </li><li>I have. - Parting it up.
  </li><li>I was, yeah, I was at a youth retreat in St. Louis.
 Well, near St. Louis.
 Well, in our south of St. Louis.
 Anyway, it was nowhere near St. Louis.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>That's the thing birthdays are,
 birthday dreams are made of.
 It's true.
 Are you a student?
 Do you have fun?
 I did have fun.
 I missed you.
 Thank you.
 Mostly because I was single-dadding all weekend.
 Yeah, but you rocked the single-dadding it's scenario.
 Well, you know what?
 You can do anything for a couple of days as long as this chocolate involves.
 You just bribe the children a chocolate?
 Honestly, I find that if the kids have one event a day and that event can be as simple
 as we're leaving the house and going to a park.
 Yeah.
 They're more than happy.
 But I learned to make pancakes while you were away.
 You did.
  </li><li>I always make them, there's no need for me to learn.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Did you do them with bananas in them?
  </li><li>No, they just wanted it my way.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>As in what it says in the bag
 without any flourish or finesse.
 (laughs)
 Is that even by your way?
  </li><li>Babe, I know.
  </li><li>Isn't that Pamela's way?
  </li><li>I know that you're feeling sensitive
 that I'm approaching your territory.
 I'd feel the same if you started getting good
 at configuring Wi-Fi networks.
  </li><li>No, I wanna configure this my way.
 You mean how the box tells you to do it?
 Yes.
 That is my way.
 Every day, could you stretch your hands towards age?
 You will pray for me.
 For me, beloved.
 I think the kids like my pancakes more than yours, because I make them,
 quote, man size pancakes.
 You do.
 You make like pancakes the size of their faces.
 And they'd love it.
 OK, I make tiny ones because then I can say, no, you've just had four pancakes.
 Yeah.
 but this way they get three man size pancakes instead of four mediocre size pancakes.
 Okay. Well, I'm trying to save their coolants.
 Welcome to this week's episode of keeping up with the Joneses, wherever things good.
 Let's talk about this week.
 So I was away on weekend. Oh, babe.
 I rode a hoverboard.
 I don't know what that is.
 Well, you stand on it.
 And when you lean forward a little bit, it moves.
 Have you seen them in the mall?
 There's like these guys in the mall that are standing on this thing and it kind of rolls around.
 It's not a hoverboard.
 That's a segue with a handle.
 Yeah, they call them hoverboards.
 Yeah.
 That's what they called it all weekend.
 A hoverboard.
 OK.
 Anyway, I wrote one.
 I was awesome.
 OK, good.
 Yeah, I just wanted you to know that.
 That was obviously the highlight you were.
 We had real skills.
 Don't don't watch the videos.
 I had skills.
 Sorry.
 We went to the we took the kids out to see trolls.
 We did. I quite enjoyed that movie.
 It was cute. There was lots of singing and the Christmas.
 Well, now we've got the soundtrack and that's all we've been singing all week.
 I noticed that in the garden.
 I was like, how does MJ know all the words of these songs?
 Wait, we're supposed to be talking about the week and we're stuck on the weekend.
 The week.
 The week flew by.
 It did. It stopped momentarily in the middle of the week because we had a wait for it,
 a seven hour meeting.
 We did. Like, like no exaggeration.
 we got into the meeting and we didn't leave the meeting, not even for lunch.
 It's worse than it sounds like it was in our finance meeting.
 It was a good meeting, but it was filled with so many acronyms.
 And I felt like the person who missed summer school in accounting and economics, I was always
 going, "Excuse me, I have a question. What does that graph mean?" And either our project was wrong,
 or their colors in Excel were terrible. But when they said the blue line,
 I was like, they're all blue.
 There's a joint.
 -It's a point to the line that you mean.
 -With nine different shades of blue.
 -Yes. And then what chart am I supposed to be looking at to follow that?
 Okay. Thank you so much.
 -But I was very proud of myself.
 This does not often I can do anything for seven hours.
 -You did really well.
 -I should get some sort of prize.
 I don't know why I didn't--
 -You take it a prize. You ate your prize.
 They kept putting the prizes in front of you to keep you in that meeting.
 -That's what they were doing.
 They were like, give the man some snacks. Here, have cashews, have grapes, have this, have that.
 Well, that was Wednesday. Monday and Tuesday, I taught one of the,
 that's a fun week. It's not really a fun week. I taught on sexual wholeness.
 Wow, was that this week?
 That was this week. Were you not there?
 I was, but I just feel like it's been so long since then. I thought it was two weeks ago.
 No, that was this week.
 Okay.
 It's weird because generally speaking in the church, nobody talks about sex.
 Yeah, true.
 And if they do, it's not a helpful.
 And so we devote a whole week to on the school and we just cover everything from dating to marriage to sex,
 to same-sex attraction, to shame, fear, control, sexual demonization, all this colossal sort of stuff.
 And it feels like we just get to a comfort level and talking about it and then that week is over.
 They just get to where they're not twitching at the word sex and then you're like, "And you're done."
 and it's a great week so much freedom.
 I love seeing people get free.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's really good.
  </li><li>And yeah, so that was the week.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Sex, a seven hour meeting.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then you left and went to St. Louis all weekend.
  </li><li>Well, I was here Thursday.
  </li><li>And I was-- - What did we do Thursday?
  </li><li>I was stuck singing troll songs all weekend.
  </li><li>Oh, sorry about that.
  </li><li>But you know what would change the pace of this podcast?
  </li><li>What?
  </li><li>We talked about the election.
  </li><li>Yeah, let's do that.
  </li><li>That's what happened in the middle of the week.
  </li><li>That is what happened.
 We stayed up late.
 on Tuesday night. And eventually I gave up just before midnight. I was like, "Ugh, they're not going
 to call this forever." And well, it was already looking like Trump had won. It was. And I woke up
 at three o'clock in the morning, checked my phone and went, "Oh, he did win." And then I went back to bed.
 So we've not really debated about talking about this. I think we wanted to talk about this.
 Yeah.
 But I'm aware there's so much to cover.
 And neither of us are particularly politically savvy related to US politics.
 Yeah.
 You have a keen interest in politics from a Canadian perspective.
 But for context sake, we can't vote or we couldn't have voted in this
 election. We're not US citizens.
 Right.
 It is.
 We'll probably God willing be able to vote in the next election.
 Yeah.
 But for now, and I've honestly never, ever shown any interest in politics.
 I probably didn't, in fact, I know for a fact, I didn't know the difference between the Democrat and Republican a couple of years ago.
 Yeah.
 So in one sense,
 wiser people than us have gotten beaten up talking about this.
 Yes.
 And so our goal is not so much to talk or to teach about politics.
 We're certainly not qualified to do that.
 Nor are we going to weigh in with our opinions, at least I don't think we are.
 I think rather because we're outsiders and because we're watching this from afar and because
 we're pastors, we do have lots of experience in human behavior. We have lots of experience in
 hurting broken reactions and we've walked with the Lord for a long time in helping people through
 conflict. Yes. So those are some of the things that we can talk about.
 But where do we get started with this, babe?
 You cute little green knight 45-year-old.
 Well, I mean, why don't we start with
 just sort of how we were both processing before the election even started?
 All right.
 Yeah.
 You know, I'm just thinking we were, I mean, again, we couldn't vote.
 And really, I think it would have been very difficult for us to vote.
 Right.
 in that, in, in my opinion, and I don't, granted, I don't know a lot about politics,
 but when we would read, you know, Jeff did a thing on Sunday morning where he talked about just the different platforms.
 What does each platform stand for? And in going through those, that information, I was like,
 well, clearly I would be more Republican. I'd be on the, you know, on the Republican side of the debate.
 Yeah, the vast majority of the values. Yeah. When we read through the various platforms
 papers, it's clear that we would lean more towards Republican values than we would Democrat
 values. I think if we were to set up the context, I would say that the advantage to us commenting
 on this is we didn't vote and we literally don't have a candidate to defend. But even then,
 I've noticed that even though we don't have a candidate to defend, people come out and say,
 "Well, why aren't you attacking this other candidate?" And so we're not here to defend or attack
 anybody's candidate. That's really not what we want to do. We realize that from looking at our stats,
 75% of our audience is American. So 75% of our listeners right now are dealing with a
 shadow 25%. You're either fed up against all probably that your news is talking about,
 or perhaps you're interested in it. I would also like to state that I would imagine that
 the vast majority of our listeners are evangelical Christians. That's the audience that we're talking
 to. It was funny this past week, I asked a bunch of different people that we know.
 Is the amount of trauma around this election normal? Because we were here four years ago
 when Obama was reelected. But we gave birth to our son the very next day. So I don't remember
 that election because all I remember is I was prepping to go in and be induced the next day.
 You know what I mean? So I don't, I know I didn't stay up. I know I didn't probably think much about
 it. Right. And so I couldn't think, is this a normal amount of trauma around an election?
 Or is this more of an extreme amount of trauma, which is what it felt like to me like it.
 And what did people say?
 Well, I mean, most people said, well, there's always a certain amount of the world's going to end
 rhetoric. But it seems like for most people, they said, this is more than usual.
 Well, what was interesting is I would say that before the election actually happened and
 the run up to the election, certainly last month or so, the most common feeling I felt from everyone
 was confusion. Yeah. Like confusion about who to vote for, confusion about why people
 would consider voting for this candidate versus that candidate. Right.
 Confusion about why you wouldn't vote for this candidate as opposed to that candidate.
 Right. Confusion about why people obviously don't think the same way that I think, you
 know, that that was most of the stuff. Like, gosh, these people must be idiots because
 they can't see this. Right. And intolerance for anybody having a different
 Totally, literal, exasperated confusion on a wide range of topics.
 Then the election happened and woke up Wednesday and found out that Donald Trump had won.
 We'll talk about that whole experience in a second, but post-election, the most common
 feeling is way stronger than confusion.
 It feels a bit like shock.
 Well, honestly, I was in shock.
 I honestly did not think he was going to win.
 did most professional pollsters. Is that what it's called? Pollsters people that do polls? I don't know. I mean political analysts. Yeah. I think generally speaking, there's shock that Trump won, but there's also shock about what this means.
 Shock about what it means for our country for our culture shock that people are celebrating shock that people aren't celebrating. I mean, there's this,
 Does this heightened level of confusion that's gone into another level?
 In the midst of the shock, however, it's worth noting that there's a smaller percentage,
 at least of the people I follow that are appearing on my timeline, for example, who have got
 sheer delight and glee in a genuine sense of excitement that Trump has been elected.
 Now I make a comment on those things, not to argue who has the right reaction.
 merely to point out that the people who are in shock don't understand why these other people could
 be so gleeful and happy. And generally speaking, the people who are gleeful and super excited about
 it can't understand why people are in shock. And so this is the part that I want to talk about,
 this disconnect where you've got two very different groups of people with equally as strong feelings
 about the turnout of the election.
 Yeah, and an intolerance towards the way the other is viewing it.
 Let's not use tolerance because that's a hugely inflammatory word.
 But yes.
 But there is. I mean, I would downgrade intolerance to this
 exasperated confusion of like, but can't you see? I mean, that's the basis of every Facebook post.
 And some people are more rude about that. Good God, these people are so stupid that
 that they can't think the way I think.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And it scales from sheer confusion
 to rudeness, I would say.
  </li><li>I think too, if I'm honest,
 in some ways I'm sad/disappointed
 because I think, I was thinking,
 okay, at least once the election is over,
 people can stop with all the nastiness on Facebook
 and it doesn't feel like the nastiness has stopped.
 It's just--
 It's accelerated and I'm just like, oh, guys, like, but I think the nastiness is, is, is woundedness.
 I do too.
 It's people who are genuinely hurt and genuinely afraid.
 Yeah.
 And perhaps I've never been given better tools to cope with them than, than, yeah, I, I, I honestly don't know.
 I'm, I'm sometimes, I'm, I'm stumped when I see things that are posted or written by Christians.
 I'm thinking, what point did it become okay to lose some of our values for?
 Yeah.
 Just, I mean, forget Christ's likeness, but just common decency.
 Yeah.
 Would you speak that way to that person if you were sharing a meal with them?
 Yeah.
 Or is there a level of anonymity that is provided by being in an electronic forum?
 I don't even want to get to that yet.
 Okay.
 So let's backtrack because we have not spoken publicly about our, we haven't really spoken publicly
 about the election. I did a little talk at M&amp;A. I deliberately chose to sidestep a bunch of the
 main topics to try and elevate the conversation a little bit differently. But we've had a few,
 hardly any, private conversations with some friends about a few things. Why don't you make
 are thinking visible about some of the things we felt during the election process.
 Yeah, I mean, I think maybe we got to stay a little bit more, even though we live in America,
 stay a little bit more on the outside because we knew we couldn't vote. So maybe didn't have
 the same level of pressure and processing. Right. And also, we don't know the rules. We don't
 know if it's polite to ask who you voting for or so we just stayed away from that topic.
 And it's funny because I asked a couple of different people, is it polite to ask people who they
 voted for. And some people said, yeah, you can totally do that. And other people said,
 no, you never do that. So I thought that was really funny.
 Yeah. And so it's an opposed card to us, please.
 Right. So I think where we ended up, or where, you know, I'll speak for myself,
 but I think it's both of us really where we ended up getting stuck is we would lean more
 towards the values of the Republican Party. But when you look at the face that's representing
 the Republican Party, i.e. Donald Trump. Wow, he doesn't represent me well at all.
 Right. In terms of a stumbling block, here is somebody, and I think it's important to know,
 we're not talking secondhand reports. Oh, we've read these tabloid reports. We're talking taking him
 at face value, literally reading the words that he writes on his Twitter feed.
 Right. Or the things that he said in the debate, that he manages himself or his face or yeah.
 Yeah. So, so we're just literally talking about the characteristics of the man that he is presenting
 to us. Yeah. Not hearsay, not reports, not history, just present day interactions with Donald Trump.
 where there is a large gap between the values that you are representing and the way you are
 managing yourself. And the messenger is the message. So that's a huge gap.
 So it's scary. It's scary because when you start saying, yeah, I would find myself more
 in line with the Republican Party. Actually, forget Donald Trump for a second, a lot of the
 people speaking on behalf of the Republican Party, I would not want representing me.
 In the way that they're managing themselves and the way that they're communicating, I'm like,
 I'm not sure I want to be tarred with the same brush as these guys.
 Then when Donald Trump starts speaking on behalf of the Republican Party, I'm like,
 I don't see you representing these values that well.
 So that is the Republican Party values.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 So I'm like, yeah, this is causing me some angst.
 Now the gap, that gap between, you're supposed to be representing me in my values.
 That gap grows larger for me at least.
 I don't want to speak for you.
 When I started seeing several of my friends and several leaders in the evangelical and
 charismatic community start endorsing Trump.
 Now, let me say this, I have no problem with people endorsing anybody.
 But what I would have liked to have seen and yet didn't was people saying, Hey,
 here's, I'm voting for Trump and here's why I'm voting for Trump.
 And yes, I understand there's some major character issues.
 This is how I've reconciled those, those very obvious issues for me.
 And yeah, nobody did that.
 Right.
 So then what you start thinking is like, am I out to lunch?
 Right.
 Am I just being judgmental?
 like, this feels like a big issue. Yeah. Like if Donald Trump, if somebody behaved or spoke the way
 Donald Trump did on my staff, I would be having huge conversations with them. Right. To the point
 where I would question whether I made the right decision on hiring them. Right. Never mind the
 President of the United States. And yet nobody who was endorsing Trump in my circle was able to
 not justify with a capital J, but explain. Like I wanted to go to the processing. How do they get
 there? How are you dealing with the misogyny or the racism or this or the dishonor with the way
 he spoke to this person or that person? And in my efforts at finding people to kind of shorten that
 gap. Usually the answer that I was given was one, yeah, but he's not as bad as Clinton or two,
 he's God's vessel, he's God's chosen person. And I would just go, those two answers aren't helpful.
 Right. They might be right. And I'm not here to debate whether they are right. I'm just saying
 that's not helpful because especially when you're a Christian leader, I feel like you then have a
 bunch of people who are following you, who are, if they're like me or going, could you help me
 work out how you got from two plus two equals purple? Right. Like what is the missing ingredient
 that makes all of these values, especially when they're people who have such a high value on Christian
 morals or just managing yourself with power. And this person is lacking that. In my humble
 observation. One of the things I loved was the New York Times, Donald Trump threatened
 to sue New York Times for libel after they posted some articles about some sort of sexual
 assault case. And so his lawyers wrote to him, and the New York Times lawyers wrote back
 and just said, "Well, as you understand being lawyers, the libel has to be a misrepresentation
 of character." But actually, by Donald Trump's own words, these complaints are entirely
 in keeping with his characters. He has displayed publicly for many, many years. And I'm like,
 that's the point, guys. How are you bridging that gap? Now, nobody has to give me an answer.
 I'm not doing an answer. The only place that I could arrive at from talking to,
 let's call them, level-headed believers that are not necessarily excited about Trump,
 but probably going to vote Trump anyway. It seemed like those people and many of them that I talk
 to are actually very politically minded and actually working in local politics and that kind of stuff.
 And they were saying, you know, AJ, it can't be about Trump anymore because he's the face of the
 Republican Party now, but it's got to be about the party and it has to be about the Supreme Court
 justices and the things that actually this next president is going to be able to do,
 it's super important that it's a Republican, not a Democrat, and that's picking the Supreme
 Court justices and you know whatever.
 And so that's how they're arriving at, I'm voting Republican and I'm kind of ignoring
 the face that's on the front of the party because that's all I can do at this point.
 And I can understand that.
 That makes sense.
 to me make sense. And in all likelihood, that might have been where I arrived. You know,
 if we were able to vote, yes, I get that mindset. And I get that that's why you would
 make this decision. And it's a good reason to make that decision. But as you say, what
 didn't make sense to me was the amount of excitement about Trump when to, to what we
 have seen so far, but it doesn't represent the things that I as a Christian would want
 represented my leader. Right. And of course, there's been these reports, the clothes I
 can get to a second hand reports of people knowing that he got led to the Lord a couple
 of weeks ago. But again, I'm going to take that with as much with a pinch of salt in
 the same way that I would take an awful lot of the rumors I heard about Hillary Clinton
 too. I don't want to base my judgments on people by second hand reports.
 And what might happen?
 A lot might happen.
 So you're saying you would speak to some people and just say, "Hey, I get that Trump supports
 X, Y, and Z, which is a big deal. But how are you managing the issue of his language or his
 temperament or the dishonor?" And what did people say remind me of that again?
 Well, and they were just, I mean, basically the feeling was, you know, we can't do anything
 at this point about who is now the head of the Republican Party.
 Would we prefer that somebody else was in that position?
 Yes, absolutely.
 You know, Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, anybody, right?
 But that didn't happen.
 And then now you have to actually look down the next four years and realize the amount
 of pull this person is going to have in terms of being able to bring in new Supreme Court
 justices. And now it becomes important that it's a Republican, even if it's Donald, because
 that's the choice that we have now. Because that's still going to give a better result,
 as far as what these people were saying, than having Clinton elect three liberal Supreme
 Court justices, which would probably see the nation down the river faster.
 Right. It's also important to point out that we are speaking from our perspective as evangelical
 Christians and our values that define what we would like to see America.
 Yes. We're also aware that two million more people voted for Hillary who would obviously
 have a completely different ideology about what would be more appropriate for the shape
 of America to come. And we'll get to that part in a second.
 Two million more.
 the popular vote, Hillary won the popular vote, Donald won the electoral votes. It's a whole
 of the system. I don't understand any of these. No, no, no.
 Do you know what? I asked several people, like several people, explained to me the difference
 between the electoral votes and the popular votes and blah, blah, blah, and none of them
 really could. There's probably a Wikipedia or we could read about it in four years time,
 and I'm sure we will. Yeah. I think the reason I didn't let myself lose that much sleep over
 anything that we've talked about so far was what we were saying earlier because we, along
 with most political commentators, thought there's no real chance he's going to get elected anyway.
 So no bond borrowing trouble, no point getting our knickers in the twist. That's a great British
 expression. And I should also point out that neither of us were thrilled with the thought of
 Hillary Clinton being elected president. I just didn't know where to put anything.
 No.
 So please don't hear us as supporting either candidate. I think honestly what we were thinking are
 What are the chances of Donald Trump, a man with zero political experience, a PR catastrophe,
 at least to my eyes?
 Apparently it was brilliant, not a catastrophe.
 But what are the chances of this man getting elected over someone with the experience and
 professional skill of a highly polished candidate like Hillary Clinton?
 Yeah, I didn't think he had a snowball's chance and a furnace.
 Right. And that all became apparent on Wednesday morning.
 Now, again, let me say as I have repeatedly said, I am fully expecting God to be amazing
 these next four years. There is no sense that I am partnering with fear or dismay or
 oh, we're screwed, nothing like that. I am fully expecting God's plan for the blessing of our
 nation to come in spite of who's in control of the White House. So I am not doing
 regardless at all. I am fully expecting God to astonish us. And that was the stance I had in my
 my heart if Clinton got elected. I just honestly wasn't thinking that Donald Trump was going
 to be the president elect. So I'm not upset that Donald Trump is a president elect. I'm
 happy with the fact that this is how democracy works. The people vote, they choose a leader
 despite the fact I don't understand the difference between popular and electoral votes. But nevertheless,
 I didn't have a vote. I'm happy to have any leader. And I would have happily prayed for
 either candidate and support them. I mean, that's the way I have done. I will pray for
 Donald Trump and believe the best for Donald Trump as I have for President Obama these
 last eight years. I have a deep respect for that office. And I know that God honors the
 position, not just the person, but still, yeah, Donald Trump.
 Yeah, I remember actually coming out in the morning and seeing Abigail and she said, "Mummy,
 did the person you wanted get elected?" And I said, "Oh, baby."
 She just wasn't in the role.
  </li><li>Yeah, I was like, we weren't real excited
 about either candidate, but I said,
 Donald Trump got elected and she said,
 well, mommy, then we start praying for Donald Trump.
 And then she just went and got her stuff ready for school
 and I was like, yeah, baby, that's right.
 But I did have some conversations that morning
 and one of the things that sort of struck my heart
 was one of the people that I talked to said,
 What was sad for them is that as a Christian,
 they felt that the message has now been sent to women
 and minority groups, underprivileged people
 and whatever, that they are not valued
 and that Christians don't value them
 because we're so excited about Trump.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And that is sad because I think to an extent
 that's probably true.
  </li><li>And well, let's talk about that fallout.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Because in speaking to friends,
 And we spoke to a few, the ones we were brave enough to say, who are you voting for?
 We've got friends who voted for both Clinton and for Trump.
 And it's worth me saying I absolutely respect both camps' reasons for doing so.
 I listened to them.
 I thought they had some great reasons for why.
 But of the friends that did vote for Trump, I found that there were three main categories
 of Trump voters.
 Number one were the people who are just 100% on the Trump train.
 No hesitation about the man.
 No, I don't think even awareness of the things that I was cautious about.
 Just all on board.
 This is going to be awesome.
 Let's go for it.
 Make America great again.
 So desperate for change.
 Hashtag left, right and center.
 And honestly, these people are an enigma to me.
 I just don't understand all of that.
 I don't know.
 And I'm going to work hard to bridge that gap.
 I mean, I love them and I love their enthusiasm, but I don't get it.
 But my efforts at understanding their choice or rather why they didn't have the same concerns
 that I had completely evaded me.
 Right.
 But I totally respect their vote.
 So go for it.
 Right.
 The second group were people who didn't like either candidate.
 And honestly, push, come to shove would rather neither of them represented them.
 But given their choice, they thought that voting for a third party was almost a throw away.
 And they basically decided probably mostly related to the issue of abortion that they
 would rather have Republican values represented in Democratic ones.
 And so they reluctantly voted for Trump.
 Right.
 And most of those are also, it's not just abortion, it was the Supreme Court justices
 as well.
 So those two main things, they're voting for the lesser of two evils in the platform that
 they prefer.
 Right.
 And then the third group of people who just don't like, they don't like Clinton more
 than they don't like Trump. And push come to shove would rather have anyone than Clinton.
 And so reluctantly voted Trump. Now, what's interesting is those people, like I said,
 are outweighed by approximately 2 million people. So according to the report I read in
 the independent newspaper, that's a British newspaper because I don't know which newspapers
 to trust in America, about 2 million people voted more for Clinton than they did for Trump.
 Wow.
 And you just have to look around the news to see what's in people's hearts.
 The people who really wanted Hillary Clinton to be the president are absolutely despondent
 and terrified.
 And there's people making really, really reasoned logical arguments for their fear.
 And the big shock I think is that for some people, Trump represents Sheer horror.
 people can't get their heads around how people voted for someone in their
 perspective who is so racist, so misogynistic and so untruthful. And then
 like we said earlier there's people who voted for Trump who can't work out why
 those people are so upset. So you got two groups of people who both don't
 understand the other side. Now that's a gross oversimplification to describe the
 climate at large but it will do for now. I was listening to Stephen Colbert for
 For those of you who are not American, you might know, Stephen Colbert is a very articulate
 and astute political comic.
 I want to play a little sample.
 I'll put a link to this whole video on the show notes.
 I hope the rest of it's appropriate.
 If it isn't, please forgive me.
 It's for late night TV.
 I'm sure they'll bleep out any bad words.
 But let me play this a little bit, which I think sums up brilliantly the point I'm
 trying to talk about.
 By every metric, I mean, we are more divided than ever as a nation.
 Do we still have this graphic from earlier before?
 According to the Pew Research Center, more than four in ten voters say the other party's
 policies are so misguided they pose a threat to the nation.
 But you know what?
 Everybody feels that way.
 And not only that, more than half of Democrats say the Republican Party makes them afraid.
 Well, 49% of, do I have the right?
 Is it 49% of Republicans say the same thing
 about the Democratic Party.
 So both sides are terrified of the other side.
 And I think that's why the voting booth has a curtain.
 So you have some place to hide after the election's over.
 So how did our politics get so poisonous?
 I think it's 'cause we overdosed, especially this year.
 We drank too much of the poison.
 You take a little bit of it so you can hate the other side and it tastes kind of good
 and you like how it feels and there's a gentle high to the condemnation, right?
 And you know you're right, right? You know you're right.
 So, babe, that's crazy. 50% of the nation doesn't trust the other 50%.
 What was it that he said? More than four in ten Democrats and Republicans say the other
 party's policies are so misguided that they pose a threat to the nation. Think about that.
 Forty percent of Democrats and forty percent of Republicans are terrified about the other
 party's policies. Another from Pew Research said that fifty-five percent of Democrats
 say the Republican party makes them afraid while forty-nine percent of Republicans say
 the same about the Democratic Party. So it's not that we're just picking out some random
 streams from Twitter or some polls from Facebook to make a point. This is from research centers
 that's saying 50% of the nation is terrified about the views of the other 50% of the nation.
 Right. And it's producing huge division.
 Well, this is where I want to make a plea to the Christians who are part of that 50%.
 because we have a piece that passes understanding. Most of the stuff on social media, most of the
 stuff in conversation, literally, I've been reading earnest articles written by people. These are
 now non-Christians who are saying, I don't know how to do Thanksgiving with my family who voted for
 Trump. Where they're like, I don't know how to reconcile this situation. I mean, and I understand
 that we are sitting here in, I think, the 13th wealthiest county in America. I recognize that,
 yes, we are immigrants to America, but we're about the most privileged kind of immigrants
 that you can get. We understood the green card process. We had enough money to pay for an immigration
 lawyer to help us through it. So we are sitting here with a certain level of education, a certain
 level of privilege, and let's face facts, a certain level of skin tone, where we are immune
 personally from a lot of the fear that other people are expressing. But here's the thing,
 as Christians, we're supposed to have a higher vantage point. We're supposed to have the peace,
 the past, the understanding. We don't need to understand somebody else's point of view in order
 to have peace. No, or to love them. Or to love them. Good Lord. I think, babe, in it right now,
 It feels like you know, especially when you read those statistics
 From that report
 You have a nation of people that are filled with fear
 Right and the only thing that casts that out is love and the only people that are gonna love well are probably us right
 I think yeah, I haven't seen a great display haven't either and it makes me so sad people are still trying to
 Are you points and drive things home guys it's done he's elected and it's actually time to start loving other people well and trying to meet them where they're at and understand what they're feeling and even where we don't understand and output myself that category i've honestly struggled.
 To understand friends of mine on both sides of the debate when they post things online i'm like are you aware how insensitive that is yes i do you realize that you're creating a large.
 gap in other people's understanding of your behavior. Yes. Yeah. And on top of that, there are,
 and we touched on this a little bit before that there are some genuine concerns that people
 are expressing. Fear about what he's going to do. I read Donald Trump's plan for the first 100
 days in office and I'm thinking, dude, even if you get like a quarter of that stuff done,
 that's going to have huge significant impact on this nation. I'm not commenting about whether
 that's for good or for bad, for better for what. I'm just saying that that is going to cause
 change in some ramifications and people generally speaking are scared of change even when we want it.
 Sure, always. Even good change is scary. So here's the thing. We carry a source of peace
 that isn't dependent on our understanding. We have access to a source of comfort,
 to a prophetic viewpoint, to an inexhaustive supply of love that we're supposed to apply
 to our own hearts, so that we're not troubled by the world, and that we can be a safe resource
 to other people, where we can look at people we don't agree with and still keep our love on,
 where we can modify our behavior to preserve a connection with people that we love,
 even though they voted for a different candidate from us.
 Yeah, I mean, so I'm not trying to be funny, but I'm just thinking.
 Scripture says, blessed be the peacemakers, not the potsters, right?
 So blessed be the peacemakers for they shall be called the huyos of God,
 the fully matured sons of God and us as believers, us as mature believers.
 Really our job is to look people in the eyes and love them well, and especially
 if they're afraid.
 Can I talk about the whole hashtag Cyrus rising?
 Donald Trump is God's Cyrus thing for a second.
 Sure.
 So if you genuinely believe that and I have no comment that I have not talked to the
 Lord about that at all.
 I have not done any research.
 So I am not mocking that perspective at all.
 For all I know, you may be absolutely right in that assumption.
 But what I am asking that you do is that you use wisdom and kind temperament in communicating your view.
 So in Scripture says you always have an answer for the hope that you have, but that hope is centered on Christ, not on another person.
 So if God's given you peace about your decision or about the future, that's fantastic.
 Use that piece to communicate peace.
 Don't use it to inflame or antagonize others.
 Yes, please.
 I think we've already said a lot about inflaming stuff.
 Here's my encouragement.
 Bill Johnson said this brilliant line.
 He said, we're our dumbest when we think we know the motives of other people.
 So that's about the quality of most discourse I see on Twitter or Instagram or Facebook.
 People, assuming they know the motives of other people and then making a comment on that.
 And of course, then other people coming on that and before you know, it's a big pile on of of huge emotion.
 And everybody's hurt and everybody's aggravated and it served no good.
 And I was triggering.
 Yeah.
 I love what Pastor Jeff said this morning.
 He said, could we please up the kindness quilter?
 Yeah.
 I was speaking to friend tonight at dinner about this.
 And I said, it's kind of like if AJ, you and I were in a car accident together.
 Yeah.
 And let's say because of the car accident, you lost both your legs, but I didn't.
 It would be insensitive of me to talk about how happy I am that I didn't lose
 my legs around you.
 Yeah, that would be extremely insensitive.
 Now, is it wrong for me to be happy that I didn't lose my legs?
 No, of course it's not.
 It's entirely appropriate for me to be expressing my joy to the Lord that I
 didn't lose my legs, but it is entirely tactless for me to be reveling in my joy
 while you are in your deep mourning and in your sorrow.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 So, I think what I'm saying is give one another space to be processing.
 I think one of the posts that I read the morning after Trump was elected, the sort of impacted
 me the most was a friend of mine named Krista Wendell.
 And Krista and her husband, Jason, are amazing.
 And they, you know, he's a Harvard grad and they've done stuff, you know, in Nairobi and
 with World Bank and all kinds of crazy stuff.
 They're two of my personal heroes.
 Oh, they're amazing, extremely well educated, very compassionate, you know, you know, they're,
 they have a passion for all people and, you know, all races and all religions that they
 would know Jesus and they're just lovely.
 I mean, they're just amazing.
 You know, if you could bottle them up and sell them and we changed the world in the heartbeat.
 -Which is why I want them to come. I'm going to be scraping or toothbrush and cloning their DNA.
 They don't know about it. They don't even listen to our podcast.
 -We'll just try and get them to come for a visit and then we'll start making clones.
 -Come for a visit. Just bring this.
 -Nothing to worry about. I hope they don't listen to the podcast. They're going to know our sneaky plan.
 -It's a spinal tap. Don't even worry about it.
 -Completely normal. -Just suck it up.
 -Anyway, she posted and she said she'd gone in to get blood drawn and there was a lady
 that was drawing her blood that was a Muslim lady,
 you know, that was in her, like in her sort of full garb.
 And Krista just leaned over to her,
 and I don't remember her exact words,
 but she basically said to her,
 "I want you to know that I am a Christian white woman,
 and I love Jesus, but I love you too,
 and I'm sorry that you're hurting."
 And the woman just started crying.
 And so Krista got to pray with her and say,
 You know, I'm sorry that you're scared. I'm sorry that we sent you this message and
 I think guys that's the thing to do now is to realize that when there's
 People hurting even if you don't get it. It doesn't matter if you get it. And even if you're not hurting right?
 You're you're not called
 To judge you're called to actually love well and so if we could actually
 Start doing that. I think we start to turn the train back around and and obviously pray for Donald Trump
 I mean, he's got quite the thing that he's going to have to manage.
 And yeah, I mean, I'm, I'm hopeful because God's good and he's still on the throne.
 And yeah.
 My encouragement to all of us is that we practice the peace we have.
 We demonstrate the kindness we've been given and we walk in the wisdom that is ours.
 I think the saddest thing that I've noticed is the best explanations I've read for our climate
 has come from non-Christian sources.
 That is sad.
 The most compassionate, well-reasoned articles that I've read in managing ourselves in this climate
 comes from non-Christians.
 Now, it could be that I'm not exposed to better writing.
 So please, by all means, guys, if you're on the internet and you read an article that you think would be in line with the stuff that we've been sharing,
 from a great Christian source, please direct it to me. I really enjoyed both of Bill Johnson's
 posts that he wrote on Facebook and was really appreciative of Bill's wisdom. If you haven't read
 them, I'll put a link to them in the show notes in that Bill didn't say anything until after the
 elections. And the poor man explained, "Hey, this is why I voted for Donald Trump. This is how I
 reconciled my differences." And it was a really, really well-written, brilliant article and I so
 appreciate that Bill took the time to write that and he wrote a follow-up I think maybe a day later
 and apparently the poor man just got beaten on the internet in response to this and you know
 it was a brilliant article that Bill wrote and I appreciate that but like I said the vast majority
 of really helpful stuff I've written is from a non-Christian source so let's up the kindness
 quote, let's tweet words of encouragement, let's refuse to enter into empty and almost harmful
 debate online. And let's raise the love level. Please, why don't we pray for our nation for
 everybody who's listening? I hope we didn't say anything that enraged you. If you did that would
 never be our heart, please, please let us know anything you disagree with. Go to Alan and
 you to come slash feedback. We would love to hear from you if there's things you think
 we missed. Of course, the stuff we missed the whole topic is enormous.
 We fully don't understand a lot of it. But if there's stuff that we said that is wrong
 or short-sighted or hey Alan, I do have you considered this, we would genuinely love to
 hear from you. Reach out to us. We'd appreciate it. And if this was helpful, again, give us
 that feedback. We'd love to know. And if you think this would be helpful for somebody
 who's going through situations, please direct them to this episode. But babe, in wrapping
 this up. Why don't we just pray for our nation, pray for our listeners and pray for peace.
 Father, I thank you that in the midst of any situation and any trouble, you are faithful.
 God, you are always faithful. You are always amazing. And thankfully, you are still on
 the throne. You are still the one that controls the tide, Lord. And Father, I ask that you
 You would come and you would shower this nation of America that we are so thrilled to live
 in with your peace and with your wisdom.
 Lord, I ask that you would give your believers wisdom and grace and peace in dealing with
 other people and that you would help us kind of repair the breach, Lord.
 You would help us be part of how this thing gets better and part of how history writes
 this out is that the Christians stood up and not only, you know, voted and we're expressive
 in that way, but then they loved others well.
 Lord, help us to be people that carry peace wherever we go.
 Amen.
 Amen.
 We have one thing as we wrap up, but you've probably heard us talk about Project Wow.
 At Grace Center, we are planning a huge overhaul of our children's ministry.
 We're currently planning on spending half a million dollars in transforming an area
 of our church into a world-class children's ministry facility because we believe God really,
 really wants to move through this next generation that's coming up.
 Next Sunday, it's going to be Sunday the 20th, it's going to be our big offering that we're
 taking up at Grace Center.
 We're asking all of our Grace Center members, all of our Grace Center friends and family
 to give above and beyond their tithes on this particular Sunday.
 I know some of you don't live in Franklin, can't attend Grace Center, but I know equally
 that some of you watch online and you've been greatly blessed by this ministry.
 I would ask that you would pray about giving towards this incredible initiative that we're
 taking and join with us.
 You can give online if you go to graceinner.us/give.
 You can give online to the building fund and your gift will go toward that half a million
 dollars that we are planning on raising this coming Sunday to build a world-class facility
 so that children can understand God's word, have an encounter with Jesus and get to know
 the Holy Spirit and the Father. You can have fun while they're doing it.
 We pray you have an amazing week. If you would like to give us feedback, like I said, allenonaj.com/feedback.
 If you have a question, like to ask us, go to allenonaj.com/ask. We will see you next week.
