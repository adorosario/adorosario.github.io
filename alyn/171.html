<p> I'll in an age is but got more Monday most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to episode one seventy one of keeping up with the jones is we are joined today by Gary and Sarah Morgan but before we go to that.
 Mr. Jones how is your week you know what it's good to be back is we skipped a week because we had to have the clear conference yes so but I've got so many highlights the jump.
 Okay, go tell me about the heaven declares conference. Oh, it was awesome. It was so good Gary Morgan and David Campbell of course
 We we told anybody who's listening to the podcast for weeks in advance. They were coming. I would highly recommend
 Getting the mp3's. Yep<br/>
 Really really good<br/>
 and David Campbell did one of my favorite
 Sermons that he does on obitatum and it just
 He just reminded me of so much stuff that I was just like,
 yes, Lord, like this is why I want to pursue the presence.
 So it was, it was good.<br/>
 It was really, really good.<br/>
 It was our fastest selling conference.
 Yeah, sold out.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 We were at capacity.<br/>
 Amazing.<br/>
 And our worship was incredible.<br/>
 Oh, it was outstanding.<br/>
 Absolutely wonderful.<br/>
 Really, really good.<br/>
 And it was so fun to be using our own worship teams because we have amazing worship teams.
 Obviously, I love it when we have guest worship teams.
 Yes, of course.<br/>
 We've had amazing guest worship.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 However, it usually takes about a session for the worship leader to
 suss out the audience and the audience to suss out the worship leader.
 Does that make sense? Right.<br/>
 And it takes about the conference just to get them warmed up, whereas with our team,
 they know our culture, we know them. You can just dive straight into the deep end, and it was just
 glorious. Yeah, it was amazing.<br/>
 I loved every bit of it. Yeah.<br/>
 So having the clears, like as you said, really encourage you to get the downloads.
 Then we've had Gary and Sarah to stay. We have.
 All week. Yes, we did.<br/>
 which was great because we got a couple of days off work.
 So we got to hang out with them, which was glorious.
 And we got to do one of our traveling dates again, where we start off in one place
 and we moved to another and to another and to another.
 So that was quite fun.<br/>
 You love that.<br/>
 I do.<br/>
 I guess you just like being at the house.
 I do.<br/>
 I like being out of the house and drinking coffee and eating good food with good friends.
 Yeah.<br/>
 So it was perfect.<br/>
 On top of the conference.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 We also had the best Friday of the year.
 the best Friday of the year.<br/>
 Okay, good Friday, probably takes the best Friday of the year, but the second best Friday of the year.
 What was the second best Friday of the year?
 Super Mario Odyssey launched and the new iPhone.
 Yes.<br/>
 Let's talk about the new iPhone for a second.
 Yes.<br/>
 So Apple releases a new iPhone at 12.01 a.m.
 California time.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 So some people like get it at 8 a.m.<br/>
 If you live in, I think Britain got it at 8 a.m.
 We had to get up at two oh one in the morning. We didn't have to we got up at like one fifty five to kind of get the sleep out of our eyes and be ready to press go
 iPhone and I thought that I had programmed everything. Yeah, I thought I'd you know just I got everything set up the way you should and then realized
 No, they're using a completely different system
 So there's a couple of false starts. They weren't ready to go right or maybe they weren't it just takes a while to propagate around the internet
 But anyway, I got to order my phone.<br/>
 I was so nervous because I was like, I don't know.
 Don't want to pick up.<br/>
 Don't want delivery.<br/>
 It will be better.<br/>
 It will be faster.<br/>
 And so I ended up going to pick it up first thing in the morning.
 I got that.<br/>
 You ordered your phone 30 seconds later.
 If that.<br/>
 Then me.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And there was no availability to pick up.
 No.<br/>
 And you got a shipping date at the end of November.
 Yes.<br/>
 But it's tomorrow.<br/>
 I know it's coming tomorrow.<br/>
 So I'm really excited.<br/>
 But yeah, it was supposed to be coming November 17th to 24th.
 and instead it's coming tomorrow.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah, Friday we got a notification, it's in China.
  </li><li>Perfect.
  </li><li>And then it went to Korea.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>This morning it was in Alaska.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>And then it went to Louisville.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>And now it's a Nashville.
  </li><li>Yep, yep, yep.
  </li><li>And tomorrow I'll be on the truck
 for delivery and Franklin D
 delivery and frankly, right. So I'm imagining you're working from home tomorrow.
 That's right. So I got mine. I got mine Friday morning at nine o'clock.
 I just walked in, picked up, walked back out again.
 So what do you think of the song you like? Do you like he?
 Here was my concern. I'm a plus user and I really like the big screen.
 I really like the shape of it. And I was worried that this was not only going to
 be too small for me, but the aspect ratio of the screen was going to throw me.
 Right.
 None of those concerns valid.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, you have been pretty much inseparable from the phone.
 When I picked it up, it doesn't look like pixels on a screen.
 It looks like somebody's done a high resolution photograph on a piece of glass and handed it
 to me.
 The picture quality is unbelievable.
 Wow.
 In the middle of the night, you got up to, well, not really in the middle of the night.
 I suppose in the middle of the morning, like four in the morning, you got up to help Gary
 and Sarah leave on Saturday morning.
 And I had this whole encounter thing that happened.
 And then I was like, where's Alan?
 And so I picked up my phone.
 I was looking at a Nest Cam to try and find you.
 And I'm watching on the Nest Cam, you looking at your phone.
 And what it looked like was that you were taking
 repeated selfies of yourself.
 And I was like, what is he doing out there?
 That is just him sitting there looking at his phone
 and taking selfies.
 And then when you came in, you were like,
 I wasn't taking selfies.
 Like I texted you something, didn't I?
  </li><li>Yeah, you were like,
 I think you're doing your light therapy wrong.
 I'm like, what are you talking about?
 And then it dawned on me that the Nest Cam,
 when it uses infrared light to be able to see in the dark.
 And the Nest Cam was picking up the infrared spray
 of the 30,000 dots of the Face ID camera
 because every time you're looking at your phone,
 it's scanning your phone to see if you're looking at it.
 And so there's all this invisible light on my face
 that you could see on the camera,
 which I thought was hysterical for me.
  </li><li>It was really funny.
  </li><li>I need to scroll back through the Nest Cam footage
 to find it and make a little of them.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
 What's it like not having the touch ID?
  </li><li>Well, for the first day,
 I kept trying to press a button that isn't there.
 Like there's no home button on this.
 And honestly, for the first day,
 I must have hit it 10, 20 times.
 Yesterday, I hit it maybe once today.
 I haven't hit it at all.
 You honestly don't notice it.
 The only time I notice it is if I'm lying down in bed,
 it won't unlock the screen with my face.
 It does it in the dark if I'm sitting upright,
 no problem, it just must be the angle
 I'm holding my phone and lying in bed
 or my hand is obscuring my face or something like that.
 But it pretty much always unlocks, never problem.
 It's very, very cool when you're using your phone
 and you need to access an app and put it in a password,
 but the developer uses Face ID,
 like one password is the app I use to store all my passwords.
 being able to tap on that never in our password and your face is your password is very cool.
 That is very cool. I'm looking forward to getting mine tomorrow. I'm supposed to be preaching
 and emanate, but I might have to get somebody else to do that so I can play with my phone.
 What do you think? I think you need to preach it because I've heard what you're speaking
 on. I'm excited. It's going to be good. You know, the other thing is I'm going back
 to using a phone without a case. You are? Because it's such a nice looking device. Oh,
 Oh, shit, people, but also it's really nice to hold.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So up until the iPhone 6,
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I never had a case, never ever.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But then the 6 and the 7 were so slippery
 that I thought I'm just gonna drop this,
 but this glass on both sides,
 it feels so good in the hand.
 I love it.
  </li><li>Does the bezel around the camera stick out?
 Or is it like kind of embedded in the glass?
  </li><li>No, it sticks out a little bit.
  </li><li>A little bit, but not as bad as, yeah, okay.
  </li><li>Not horrible at all.
 So yeah, love it.
  </li><li>And what about Super Mario Odyssey?
  </li><li>Everything I ever wanted it to be.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>It's all I've dreamed about and it's come through.
  </li><li>You spent like, what, the first day that you had it?
 10 hours or something?
  </li><li>Well, all the stars aligned.
 I didn't buy it when it came out
 because we had a conference, we had guests,
 I didn't want to be rude.
 But then it was our day off
 and you and Sarah went out for the day
 and Gary's quite like me
 that he's like high influencer on stage,
 but then it's just content to just absolutely unwind
 on his phone or on his laptop, just sitting and so forth.
 So he sat on a sofa and looked at his phone.
 I sat on a sofa and looked at the screen
 and just had almost 10 hours on interrupted gameplay.
  </li><li>Now, when you say we went out for the day,
 actually we went out for about two hours of the day.
  </li><li>Hmm, I don't remember that.
  </li><li>No, that's because you were upstairs playing a game.
 (laughs)
 for the rest of the day, we were very much at home.
 But yes, you got some good playing in there.
 Well, you were very nice to me.
 I finished the game in three days.
 Um, what?
 I finished a game in three days.
 You've already finished the game.
 Yeah.
 But let me explain.
 There's finishing a game and then there's completing a game.
 Oh, dear.
 What does that mean?
 You have to go back and get all the stars and fishes and moons and
 a less for human.
 Wouldn't need to.
 Somebody might just be happy completing the narrative of the story and crossing a low bar that Nintendo said
 And so you you finish the game and you're like oh, that's that's wonderful
 However, you haven't even scratched the servers like I in finishing the game. I ended up with about 200 power moons
 Power mints. Yeah, okay. Yeah, there's a thousand of them. Oh, no, I which is great
 you have eight hundred more to find.
 So I get to go back even though I've finished the game,
 I get to go back and collect every special coin in every
 power moon and unlock all the secret levels that are undoubtedly there because Nintendo
 is just. But here's what I love. The game rewards exploration beautifully.
 Like you'll be wondering, you're like, I wonder, I wonder if I climb that cliff and now that
 I'm up at the top, I wonder if I just kind of look down and let's put the camera.
 Oh, I was right. Okay. Hmm. That rock looks a little different from all the other drugs
 I wonder if I jump on it doesn't do anything. I wonder if I kick it and that doesn't do anything
 I wonder if I drive this thing into that did it. I wonder if I pirouette on top of it while yodeling
 You know the first game I ever played was Mario 64 and I think I don't know how old I would have been
 maybe 18 19 maybe 20 something like that and
 If I remember this correctly
 I think Glenn arranged a bunch of friends to buy this console for me.
 And so my first game was Mario 64 and I completed it.
 Every red coin and every star and it felt wonderful.
 And that means nothing to me, but I'm sure there's people that that are listening
 that understand my point.
 The red coins in the stars.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It was just pivotal in the life cycle of video games.
 It was just this new benchmark.
 Well, in this new game, they have a level that's an homage to that game.
 and no word of a lie. When this level appeared, I did an audible gasp and clutched my chest.
 I was like, "Oh, no." It was so nostalgic and wonderful. Anyway, I have to say, what was the one,
 the last Mario game that was like that that you played that made me a 3D world?
 -Super Mario 3D world. -Mario Widow.
 -Yeah. -You've done better. I mean, it doesn't sound like it because 10 hours of first day,
 but it was fine. But you've done way better so far even with this game when I've been like,
 "Hey babe, I need your help." That I don't have to negotiate with the terrorists who are just like,
 "Okay." And you paused it and just came and how old that is.
 Well, the difference with that game is once you start a level,
 it pretty much, a lot of them will just run themselves and you have to keep up with it.
 And in that game, the Super Mario 3D World, there was a start of the level, there was a clear end
 of the level, and there was a very linear path and some objectives to do. This one's just an open
 world where you can just wander around. And so it doesn't matter if you pause. So that's
 why that is. Plus I'm trying to make sure that you don't end up a Mario video.
 Thank you. So anyway, it's been a tremendous two weeks. Filled, love tank filled with friends,
 with Holy Spirit at the conference, with new iPhones, with a Mario game that's just made me
 Giggle like a little school girl and to top all that off.
 Yeah, go on.
 We were given the new Nike Series 3 Apple watches.
 That what you call them or no.
 You're just a Nike edition, but yes, the Series 3 Apple watches with LTE.
 It's the proper name.
 You have the Nike edition.
 I do.
 I have a non Nike edition, but there really isn't that much difference between the two.
 Oh, well, it's amazing.
 It's legit. So I went for a run yesterday. Just my watch and my AirPods.
 No phone. No phone. No housekeeping.
 But if I needed to, I could still call you and say help, I've fallen and I can't get up.
 Yeah, because your watch doubles as a cell phone.
 That's right. We're all up to date in the Apple ecosystem.
 We are. I'm so excited. So I'm loving the new watch. So having caught you up from the last two
 Two weeks, Gary and Sarah.
  </li><li>Guys, welcome back.
 Your third time on the podcast, Gary's third time.
 Sarah's second time.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>You had Mother's Day off last time, you were here.
  </li><li>We're good to you like that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 You were ministering at the school this week,
 just wrecking our first and second year students
 with revelation, and then Gary,
 you were having declared the week before busy, busy, busy,
 and before that a crazy schedule.
 So if you don't know who these guys are,
 if you haven't heard of Gary or Sarah Morgan,
 You haven't heard the story.
 Do yourself a favor.
 Just stop listening to this and go and listen to episode 90 and then episode 151.
 You get to hear who they are, their story.
 But to say people who have ignored that and haven't paused, tell us where you're from,
 where you live and what you do.
 Well, I'm from Wales.
 And I'm from New Zealand.
 Currently living in Australia.
 Neither are you from Australia.
 Some people think you're from Australia, but that's because you're from New Zealand and
 people think, oh, New Zealand, Australia, it's that part of the world.
 It's because they play too much risk as a child.
 It was like Canada and America.
 People think that's one country, correct.
 Or I'm from Scotland and people like, oh, so you're the same as Ireland.
 Nobody thinks that Canada and American one country.
 You'd be amazed.
 No, they get the accents mixed up, but they're very different.
 Thank you.
 So Wales, New Zealand briefly tells how you end up in Australia.
 A God thing.
 That's about as brief as we can.
 Wow, that was impressive.
 I just thought we were real everywhere.
 I nailed it.
 We thought we were actually moving to New Zealand from the US,
 and God totally intervened.
 And we found ourselves being offered a church in Melbourne,
 Australia, which we thought we would never, ever, ever do,
 never say never to God.
 And we started leading a church in Melbourne, Australia.
 And you have just recently stopped leading a church.
 And now you're stepping out into a different facet of ministry.
 What exactly are you guys doing again?
 Well, about two years ago,
 there was a dream in our heart
 of what we know now as School of Prophets
 and a dear couple, Ting and Sam,
 when they came out to be with us in Australia,
 realized the dream in our heart and walk us up to it.
 And so we have been on this journey
 of just seeing this amazing unfolding of something we never thought was possible, but
 as in the last two years, it's just been a dream come true of seeing people trained,
 equipped and released in the prophetic Sioux School of Prophets.
 We're going to get into school of prophets in a second. But before we talk about that,
 I want to know how did you both learn to prophesy because you both prophesy for a living kind of sounds like a funny thing to say, but
 what was your journey into the profession pretty sure we've covered that, but I can't remember in a nutshell, like Sarah, how did you
 because I can remember being taught how to prophesy like it was a mystery to me that people could prophesy and then I was taught by some prophets
 and then what we call activated, which sounds terrifyingly scary, but basically they just taught me from the Bible. Hey, this is available for everybody and then give me some access
 sizes and we all learn. What was your process?
 My mum actually saw a lady prophesy at a women's camp. My parents were brethren.
 Go brethren.
 And so they didn't know that this existed until she went to a charismatic women's camp,
 came home. She said, this lady does it so we can do it. So she would make me prophesy
 most nights of the week. And then she would do pastoral counseling and I'd come in
 from school or whatever. And she'd like, you've got a word for this person.
 like mama just walked in she goes no you've got a word for this person so I'd have to
 prophesy and then go do my homework so that's how I grew up in the prophetic we I had no
 biblical paradigm for it so I learnt that later.
 So you learned the practice first?
 Correct.
 And then the paradigm later?
 Yes.
 Okay.
 And then I got introduced to a prophet the first time I ever saw a prophet was when I
 was 13 and a half years old and when I saw him in action it's all I wanted to do.
 Isn't that funny that we we can say the sentences and it doesn't sound weird
 Like I just remember a time when I didn't know a profit if it came up and punch me in the face
 I I didn't think props were real. I'm not supposed to do that. I thought there was all Old Testament
 But here we are just have like a casual conversation about the first time in my profit Gary
 What about you? Where did you learn to prophesy? So for me in?
 1997 when I got baptized in the Holy Spirit, it was more of a sovereign
 part for me, but my desire to learn from that ability to be able to see, perceive and understand,
 I really went into this sort of training of where I would take pictures of people and put them on my
 mirror and then just practice prophesying. And then would grab my sisters dolls or puddly toys and
 and then begin to practice prophesying over them.
 And so it's be funny to begin with,
 but yeah, we all start somewhere.
 So you guys--
  </li><li>So we should start lining up all of our cuddly toys
 and see what kind of words you have for them, okay?
  </li><li>Exactly, Abigail and T, you're gonna love that.
 (laughing)
 So you guys were largely self-taught
 and then learned as you went along.
 So what a joy to now actually have some
 deliberate, intentional framework
 that you can teach other people.
 'Cause let's face it, I don't mean to sound cavalier here,
 but sitting at the table, the prophetic ministry
 is not an unknown quantity to us,
 but certainly there's a time in my life
 when I just didn't even know,
 A, I didn't know existed,
 and then you move to Holy Mother of Pearl, it exists,
 but how do they do that?
 Then you begin to learn how you do,
 and you're like, no, it can't be like that.
 And then you grow in wisdom.
 So I was thinking, you know,
 as you and I were talking,
 we could cover so many different things this week.
 We could talk about the prophetic,
 We could talk about favor or blessings or signs and want to blah, blah, blah, blah.
 But what we really wanted to do this week was talk to you about the School of Prophets.
 So first of all, pretend I know nothing about School of Prophets.
 What is the School of Prophets?
 Because it sounds intimidating.
 Yeah, concerning Tim and Dylan.
 I guess School of Prophets is a ministry that we've set up and burst from our hearts to see people moving,
 greater dimensions than we're moving in when it comes to the prophetic, but not just moving it, but have the foundation in their lives that has maybe taken us 15 years,
 that we can really bring down into a year or nine month course where we're cultivating them environments and foundations in their life so that maybe God can expedite something in and through them,
 through them so that we can see not just a Gary and Sarah impact the world,
 but we can see hundreds and thousands of people through school of
 profits, just bless, encourage and change the world to love.
 I love that answer. Sarah, I'm looking for a really practical answer.
 What is the school of profits?
 Like what is it like?
 That was the part.
 Here's the practical.
 Such a good Gary answer.
 That is a perfect Gary.
 And I'm thinking, well, like, the who, what, where, why, when, like, like, is it a building
 that people go to?
 Is it, you know, explain it to me like I'm a five-year-old.
 Okay.
 School of Prophets.
 Gary and I run a school of prophets.
 What happens is on previously on a Thursday night, but this coming year, we're actually
 switching to a Wednesday night, we come together.
 There are two sessions every week.
 We start with worship and then we move into teaching and practical activations.
 And the course is split up into two semesters and we have a mid-term break, which most people
 don't like because it's two weeks off school.
 We have about 35, 36 sessions in total.
 I mean, nights, I should say, plus an encounter weekend where we get to dive deep into heart
 stuff for God to really just heal our hearts.
 the heart journey is a really big component of the school.
 Literally it's a school that people come to sit down and you teach them about prophetic
 ministry.
 Correct.
 And it's a safe environment where they get to practice that.
 Yes.
 Let me just ask you some silly questions.
 Do you have to be able to prophesy in order to be able to come do the school?
 No.
 So you don't need any background in understanding?
 You don't.
 It does make it easier for you if you have some form of a paradigm of prophetic ministry.
 Like you've seen it.
 You believe in it.
 Correct.
 Otherwise you've got quite a long learning curve to do,
 but we've had a couple of people.
 We actually, the first year we did it,
 we had three people that even up to the second semester
 said they couldn't hear God.
 And so at that point, we'd already done our surveys
 and checked in with our students,
 and they really were struggling to hear God.
 They just could not grasp that they could hear God for themselves.
 And we were able to sit with them and pass them through that.
 And babe, why don't you tell the testimony of one of them?
 I was just watching them by the end of the year.
 It was absolutely amazing.
 Tell the--
 So this lady comes, signs up for the school.
 And really, there was a reluctance in--
 I think she had an evangelical background.
 And so there was a reluctance in her to even step out in this.
 And so we get to halfway through the year.
 And she came to us quite distressing
 that she wanted to drop out of the school,
 that she felt that she wasn't making any contribution,
 that really she was finding it a real stretch.
 And so we just encouraged her and said,
 hey, you're in this far,
 why don't you just complete the year?
 And so one of the things in the first half of the year,
 our first semester,
 we look at more of the in-depth part of what the prophetic is
 and the heart journey.
 And then the second half is more the practical application.
 And so we came to September and we had one of our press Patries.
 And this is live press retreat, not a close press
 retreat, but a live press retreat.
 Explain what that is for people who don't stand.
 And so that's when people who are in the school
 stand up at the front of a meeting or a church and will pick people
 as they're led to who they want to encourage our
 profits over either through just selecting them or through words of knowledge.
 So this is like where the rubber hits the road.
 This is where the rubber hits the road.
 This is them testing what they've learned live.
 And so we threw it open to the school.
 It's a requirement for them to come to at least one
 pressatory.
 They can come to a closed one, which means people in a room,
 usually in groups of two and a person comes and receives,
 or a live pressatory, which is in a meeting.
 And so she rocks up to a live pressatory.
 So I see you walk in and so I walked up and I said,
 "Hey, do you realize what's happening today?"
 She said, yeah, I do.
 And I said, no, no, this is a live press retreat.
 You're in front of the whole church.
 Yeah, I know.
 And so I'm like, wow, okay, let's see what happens here.
 And so the press retreat starts.
 We hand it to the first person they prophesied,
 then she takes the mic,
 quite boldly takes the mic
 and points this person out, asks them to stand,
 reads they may, like tells them details about their life,
 like only they could have known and blesses them and God just hits them in the meeting.
 Like impacts left, my mouth is hit, my mouth has hit the floor because I'm like, wow,
 where's this woman come from?
 And so we just saw such a transformation from when she came in to seeing her minister in
 such boldness and authority.
 It was just amazing.
 What do you think the difference was from i want to quit i can't do this to look at somebody in red the secrets of the heart i think one of the aspects i think of that island is that.
 One is identity was secured within her life and the second one that she.
 trusted us that she could step out. I think one of the environments of the so key in the prophetic is that people not only receiving prophetic ministry but giving prophetic ministry feel safe.
 Wow.
 And that's the greatest environment leaders can give.
 So the other thing that was really key for her was actually learning how she heard God and not comparing the way she thought she should hear God.
 Wow, that's key, isn't it?
 And because you see people from the front prophesying and they say, oh, I see where I hear,
 and we can get locked into those two things instead of understanding that God can speak
 many different ways to us. Right. That's amazing.
 So this is a school that people show up for, like it's limited to Australia.
 No, the actual school is available online. Oh, wow.
 And so this was a component that we launched right at the beginning and just saw amazing results from.
 And so along the way we've been tweaking and improving. And so we really wanting to give our
 online classroom or our online students the same feeling and experience as the in-house students have.
 So you have, you have both schools in Australia because there's more than one spot in Australia
 where they meet, right? The actual school consists of sort of three components. One is the in-house
 where all the teaching and recording is done through multi-camera, high definition, and...
 And that happens in Melbourne. That happens in Melbourne.
 Right. And so that content then is uploaded for our online students through an online portal.
 where they do activations and also assignments.
 But then this past year,
 a second year of the school,
 we actually launched something called the Hub,
 where instead of people watching the online content
 at home by themselves and having to do the activations,
 they get to come together in a local church
 and are able to watch the teaching on a big screen
 and then a facilitator,
 then within the hub facilitates the activations and also the assignments within a group context.
 And so there's accountability and also as well, everyone loves to do everything together.
 And so yeah. Right. And there's community. Yeah, which is key.
 Right. For sure. So last year, you had a hub in Perth. Is that right?
 No, last year, this past year, we've had a hub in Brisbane and next year, we're actually launching
 the hub in Perth. Oh, that's exciting. So as this thing grows, you could have hubs all over the world
 and you just decided hubs presumably where there's a large contingent of people all
 wanted to do the school. Yeah, that's probably the bigger vision. I guess one of the things we
 really are trying to look at is these hubs, the one in Brisbane and also the one in Perth though,
 is we want to be able to fly into them places at least five times to teach live.
 Oh, you guys.
 Yes.
 So that makes sense.
 Some of the pillar or some of the main sort of topics.
 So they have that live sort of experience.
 But as things grow out, and I can imagine all over the world,
 there's people, we can establish hubs and plant facilitators who carry our hearts.
 And we also, and also the churches that we choose to plant hubs out, we are also building
 with them in the prophetic. So we were also wanting to help them facilitate a prophetic team
 and what that looks like in their context. So it's not even though that church is helping us serve
 the community and not just their own church, we really want to partner with them and help them
 in a building sense as well.
 So anybody listening to this could apply to school of profits and could have a school
 experience anywhere in the world remotely, learn from you guys and they're allocated
 to small group leaders so they get some sort of personal... it's not just them watching
 YouTube videos of you guys' teachers, them watching the live session from the night before
 they're connected with people all over the world, they've got a small group leader.
 That's an amazing vision.
 One of that if we talk about the online component, Alan, is that we want to create as much of
 an in-house, personable environment online as we can.
 And so to help us do that, one of the things we've done is what we call online coaching.
 And so we'll have a Skype or a Zoom time where a lot of the online students come together
 in an online sort of component.
 And I or one of the other facilitators
 will actually coach them in the prophetic.
 And so we'll have a sort of online prespiratory.
 I'll encourage them to prophesy over each other.
 And then I give them feedback on their prophetic ministry.
 And so they don't feel like they're being shamed
 or they feel like they're being corrected,
 but they're actually being coached.
 And that has been the greatest feedback we've had this year.
 All the online students like,
 Thank you so much for coaching us.
  </li><li>So in saying that it's online,
 where have you had students from then
 that are tuning in online?
  </li><li>We've had them from multiple countries.
 So we've had them from Taiwan, United Arab Emirates,
 UK, US, Europe, Australia, South Africa.
  </li><li>Whoa.
  </li><li>Did you say Qatar as well?
  </li><li>Yeah, Qatar.
  </li><li>That's amazing.
  </li><li>Yeah, we've had, actually this past year,
 we had quite a few from Qatar.
 And last year we had quite a number from Sri Lanka.
  </li><li>Wow, that's amazing.
  </li><li>So Gary, you started off, I loved your answer
 to my question, what is the school of profits?
 You just went straight into vision,
 but feel like flash out some of that.
 Like why did you guys start that?
 You're busy people, you've got your own,
 at the time you were leading your own church,
 now you've got your own itinerant ministry.
 Why did you start a school of profits?
 That's a huge undertaking.
 I guess for us, it came out of that, the realization, the greatness is when you start something that doesn't stop with you.
 And so for me is I, you know, yeah, I say that all the time.
 That's an Alan Jones statement.
 I just borrowed.
 And so we didn't want to just, you know, bless.
 we just didn't want to be Gary and Sarah and be the gifts that God has called us to
 be to the body of Christ.
 But we wanted to multiply and steward.
 And so, you know, Proverbs says, a wise man doesn't just leave an inheritance for his
 children, but his children's children.
 Right.
 That's not just monetary.
 That's, you know, legacy.
 What can we leave our children's children in the earth?
 you know, using a Baptist term if the Lord carries.
 But for me, it's seeing multiple generations
 equipped and released because we can't go everywhere
 and we can't be everything to everyone.
 And so for us, it's multiplying ourselves.
  </li><li>I remember Graham Cook saying,
 often he's invited into churches
 and say, you know, before he comes to say,
 "What we found we were doing?"
 They're like, "Oh, we want you to prophesy."
 And he's like, is that it?
 You know, yeah, yeah, could you just come and prophesy?
 And he's like, I mean, I can do that.
 But if I come in and prophesy and I leave,
 I take my prophetic words with me.
 I could come in and I could teach all of you to prophesy.
 And then when I leave, you've got prophetic ministry.
 And I think one of the, you know,
 we've been talking a lot of grace in her
 about the fivefold ministry.
 And one of the things that prophets do
 is they raise up other prophets.
 They are the gift to the church,
 to give the church eyes and ears to hear.
 And you guys are phenomenal at breaking down the really seemingly complex parts of the supernatural
 and putting it in really, really practical terms and then modeling it like few other
 people I know it's amazing to watch.
 So, tell us some testimonies from the students that have been on the school.
 So, one guy signed up for the school first year and again, halfway through he wanted
 to drop out. And so I went to visit him and his house, older, older gentleman, engineering
 background. And so I went to sit down with him and he said, Gary, he said, I've, you
 need to know something. I have spent decades going to every prophetic school, every prophetic
 conference. He said, I've, I've been with the who's who in the prophetic zoo. And he
 He said, "I still cannot you, God."
 He said, "I've had impartation after impartation.
 I've lined up for hours for people to pray for me."
 And he said, "I still cannot you, God."
 And so I'm sitting with him,
 and all of a sudden I'm attracted to this device
 that's on a shelf.
 And I said, "Jim, tell me what's that on the shelf?"
 He said, "Oh, that's a, and he uses this long word."
 And I said, "Well, what is it?"
 He said, "Oh, it's used to measure depth within the earth."
 I said, "Where did you get it from?"
 He said, "I invented it."
 I said, "What?"
 I said, "How did you invent it?"
 He said, "Well, quite simple.
 "I saw a need and I invented it."
 I said, "Well, Jim, that's kind of like the prophetic.
 "We see a need in someone's life
 "and we ask the Lord to give us something for them."
 I said, "Where did you get that from?"
 He said, "Well, I saw it."
 I said, "So how did you see it?"
 And all of a sudden it just clicked.
 He had cursed or he had said, "I can't see because I'm an engineer."
 And so he had taken that part of his life that he sees and boxed it as the
 engineer and was trying to be a prophet.
 I said, "Jim, in the next class, why don't you come as Jim, the engineer,
 and see what happens?"
 And from there, it unlocked the prophetic in his life to where he was just
 able to prophesy because he saw it as a, as a, as a need or something that,
 needed fixing or something that needed his attention as an engineer.
 And so every time he saw someone he's like, okay, what do they need?
 And he accessed that part of his imagination the same place as invention came from.
 Now invitation came for him to impact people's lives.
 Change his life.
 I'm believable.
 Oh, I love it.
 One of the things that test in many ways that is reoccurring is the students come expecting
 to hear God's voice and to learn how to prophesy. But the transformation that actually happens
 in their own hearts through the whole journey, we've had multiple marriages restored, families
 totally impacted because they've gone through this personal journey with the Father and
 experienced his heart for themselves. And their whole life is completely different.
 I said at the conference I was introducing Gary and I said that line, it was Larry Randolph
 who said the fundamental problem prophetic ministry today is you have people speaking
 on behalf of God who do not know the heart of God.
 And the thing I love about you guys like your ministry is marked by the father like when
 you guys prophesy you feel the affection of God.
 And one of the things I so love is that your whole heart is not to teach people the mechanics
 of prophetic ministry, but to get people connected to the father so they hear his voice as a
 father speaking to them as children to bless his other children.
 That's going to be one of the unique parts of your school.
 Yeah.
 And like we say to the students, you know, you, you might think you've come here
 for the content, but it's actually we're going to teach you the intent that it's,
 it's about the intent of your heart, not the content of your mouth.
 I have to ask, where do you get all that stuff from?
 Like, where do you get all the rhyme rhymes?
 How does that work?
 not the intent.
 -It's just a million of them.
 -But Welsh heritage, I think.
 -I have a Welsh heritage and I don't rhyme.
 [laughter]
 -That makes sense.
 Welsh heritage.
 They do.
 They're all kind of rhyming, aren't they?
 -Yeah, they are.
 -You're thinking of cocking rhyming slang.
 -No, I sure you would.
 -I need to grow up in Wales, which she didn't.
 -That's true, but I know lots of Welsh people
 who don't flow in Revelation that rhyme.
 [laughter]
 -Have you always--
 As long as I've known him, he's done that.
 It's just something I think it's I think it's the spirit of wisdom and revelation as well in that sort of, you know, if I see it, I'll say it.
 And so it just makes sense to me.
 In your brain also works and patterns.
 Yeah, I work in patterns.
 Sorry, Gary.
 I interrupted you.
 You were saying it's not content is intent.
 Yeah.
 In that it's the posture of the heart.
 It's about the launchpad.
 You know, Matthew 1234 says, "Out of the overflow, the heart, the mouth speaks."
 And so for me, you've got to find that space where we want to focus on people's ground
 zero of their heart, not the content that's coming out of their mouth.
 And so when they prophesy, people are not just receiving a ministry, but they're receiving
 an encounter.
 Give me some practical details like when does it starter when our applications open so applications open now
 you can go to school of profits dot org dot au and
 Applications close at the end of January school starts on the 21st of March. So let's say I sign up for I live in
 Nashville, Tennessee. I sign up for your school and I get accepted
 what like
 Can I set my hours of when I do it like or I mean how does it work for me?
 Like do I have to check in every week? Do I have to watch stuff? Do I like talk to me about the my commitment as an online student?
 So what happens is Wednesday night will be having the session
 Thursday or Friday the teaching will be uploaded and then you have a week from the time that it's uploaded to watch and do your homework and then you upload your homework to the
 classroom. So it's a weekly commitment. I watch it. I submit my homework and I upload it.
 Correct. Yep. And so the commitment we have an amazing homework resource by Aj Jones.
 I've heard of her. Yes. She's a cute Canadian that lives in Franklin, Tennessee.
 She is indeed. She wears librarian classes that drives her husband.
 Yeah, so AJ's book is actually a really key component in our school.
 So that's one part of the homework.
 And then the other part of the homework for online students is they get weekly questions
 so that we can see that you are actually watching it and understanding the content.
 And then there's activations as we progress throughout the year.
 And when do I meet with my small group leader?
 You meet with your small group leader once a month, but you have...
 Again, electronically over Skype.
 through Skype at this stage, but we also use Zoom as another portal, just depending on
 people's ability and access to internet.
 So Skype works sometimes better than Zoom.
 And the other aspect as well is you don't just get a small group leader, you also get
 that online coaching, usually for myself or Sarah or one of other other school staff.
 And also as well then, there's also an encounter weekend that you get to be part of online.
 And so that's one of the feedbacks we're getting from particularly the encounter weekend, coupled
 with A.J.'s book "Finding Father," just sets people up for the win every time.
 That they come to the end of the school, and this is the testimony, is we truly thought
 we came to learn to prophesy.
 But we've not just discovered our heart, we've discovered his heart.
 We haven't just discovered his voice, but we've discovered ours.
 Oh, I love it.
 And I was looking at your website earlier.
 You've kind of got the who's who of charismatic Christianity endorsing your school.
 I mean, that's amazing.
 I just watched a video by Bill Johnson saying, you guys are the bomb.
 I'm like, hey, Bill, step back.
 I knew them first.
 OK, they are the bomb.
 Yeah, we're going to have to have a discussion with Bill about that.
 Exactly.
 Yeah, for sure.
 I just think it's such an amazing resource.
 And if you're listening to this, if you're a regular podcast listener, you're already
 doing what you need to do. You're listening to some sort of revelation via the internet
 and you're growing. I would encourage you to take it a step further, commit to, how long
 was your school? Eight months? Eight, nine months? Yeah, commit to doing a weekly tuition
 with these guys. I honestly don't know anybody better to teach you in the prophetic ministry
 than these guys. It's something I've been passionate about. I wish I'd found you guys
 when I was learning in the prophetic. Babe, we should do their school. We could exchange
 schools.
 We can take these schools.
 Look at that.
 AJ, you have to do your book though and hand it an all on time.
 All the assignments.
 Okay.
 I'll try.
 Isn't that cheating?
 Like I think she knows the answers.
 All right.
 Let's wrap this bad boy up.
 We did want to let you know that heaven declares was an amazing conference.
 We loved it.
 If you would like the MP3s, you can head on over to greycenter.us/heavendeclares and
 you can download the MP3s there.
 There was a killer conference featuring Gary Morgan and David Campbell from Scotland.
 Well, he's from England, but he has a Scottish accent.
 So we'll see from Scotland.
 Yeah.
 Amazing conference.
 He's a missionary to England.
 That's right.
 He's trying to get the people back to the promise land.
 That's right.
 Yeah.
