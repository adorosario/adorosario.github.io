<p> I live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Mrs. Jones?<br/>
 Yes, sir.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 I'm good. How are you?<br/>
 I have a very full belly.<br/>
 You do?<br/>
 Filled with brisket.<br/>
 It's true.<br/>
 We just came back from having dinner with a friend,
 and we ate at the Butcher Town Hall.<br/>
 We did.<br/>
 Which is a great restaurant up in Germantown, in Nashville.
 It is.<br/>
 And it's very, it's very, um, uh, meet friendly.
 If you like meat, it's a good place to go.
 Yeah.<br/>
 You basically just go and, and order slabs of pounds of meat.
 Yes.<br/>
 And then vegetables.<br/>
 Well, yeah, if you want to easy on the vegetables.
 Well, I had a fair amount of Brussels sprouts because they, they do pretty mean
 Brussels sprout.<br/>
 It's been great to be back at work.<br/>
 It has been.<br/>
 After a couple of weeks vacation, gorgeous.
 What an amazing team we have.<br/>
 We have an incredible team.<br/>
 It's fun to like your job so much that you look forward to going back to work after vacation
 as opposed to dreading it or something.
 That's right.<br/>
 Yeah, I wonder how unique we are in that situation.
 I do know.<br/>
 I feel very blessed.<br/>
 Me too.<br/>
 How are you doing with unpacking our house?
 Not that that's your job.<br/>
 The way I said that, as if I've delegated that task to you.
 I feel like I've slowed down in the last day or two.
 My shoulder is killing me, but I did get the whole kitchen unpacked.
 you got a fridge delivered today?<br/>
 And oh, it's such a pretty fridge.<br/>
 So do you get excited about fridges like I get excited about new Apple products?
 Could be.<br/>
 But I get excited about new Apple products too because I'm married to you.
 But yeah, the new fridge is so weird and I haven't moved anything from the secondary
 fridge into the primary fridge yet because I want to really think about how I'm going
 to organize it before I move anything.
 It's not a good time to confess that I just dumped the leftovers from the rest of the
 night.<br/>
 I saw them.<br/>
 I can't believe you did that, but I did see them.
 I love that you have a redundant array of fridges.
 Well, I love that, like for example, our ice cream maker can be kept now in the secondary
 freezer.<br/>
 So if we want to make ice cream, we can.
 We've never made ice cream in the last five years.
 We have not made ice cream.<br/>
 No, you're probably right.<br/>
 But if we want to, it's there.<br/>
 Well, I used to have a spot.<br/>
 Praise God for backup fridge.<br/>
 Well, in the previous house, before this last one, I had a spot I could fit it in that
 freezer.<br/>
 And so it was always in the freezer.<br/>
 So if you wanted to make ice cream, you could.
 But in this, in the last house, I couldn't fit it in and fit in like chickens and stuff.
 And so...<br/>
 Let's keep talking about this.<br/>
 law like I'm happy. We are slowly but surely unpacking our house.
 Yes.<br/>
 And I've loved having people come to stay already. We've already got people who are staying.
 It's true.<br/>
 Which I love.<br/>
 I genuinely.<br/>
 We had a friend whose air conditioning went out that stayed with us this week too.
 Yeah, that was great.<br/>
 It was very fun.<br/>
 I think I like it more when there's not boxes literally everywhere.
 Yeah. It's a little stressful. Like I consider today just moving every box I can see down into
 the basement and then we can pick one up and bring it up and unpack it.
 No, because you know who will be implementing that plan because right now you have that
 vision of I will move everything down to the basement.
 But that means is I will move.<br/>
 No, no, I mean, I was literally looking at it thinking, does just like three or four
 boxes right here, I could move this into the basement that clears up the way that's blocked
 into the dining room.<br/>
 Nope.<br/>
 Not going to happen.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 Otherwise, we'll end up with boxes in our basement for 48 years.
 That will never open.<br/>
 Literally, we have boxes in our basement right now that came with us from Canada.
 Yes, but they have been opened.<br/>
 I opened and sorted through all of those boxes when I organized the garage last year.
 I'm remaining silent.<br/>
 You should.<br/>
 Let's talk about going to an optician with three small children.
 I don't want everyone to do that again.
 I thought it was wise to bring all three together and just get it done.
 And they thought it would take about 45 minutes.
 Two hours later, we're still in the office.
 And I'm maxed on the amount of joy I can possibly muster.
 I like the determination of the staff that they thought they were going to get to use
 highly complex equipment with MJ, who is three and a half, that required huge levels of user
 interaction.<br/>
 So it's not like they needed to do all the technical tasks.
 He needed to do all the technical tasks.
 They're like, "Okay, look at it.<br/>
 "Okay, make your pupil there.<br/>
 "Okay, lean in really wide.<br/>
 "Okay, now stare at it.<br/>
 "Okay, lock on your iris."<br/>
 And I'm like, "He's three.<br/>
 "He literally doesn't understand anything you're saying."
</p><ul>
  <li>And don't play.
  </li><li>You're like, "Oh, yeah, that's not gonna happen."
  </li><li>So I just had a quiet word,
 but then I was like, "He only has a limited amount
 "of patience for this,
 "and you're getting dangerously close to using it."
 (laughing)
 And that goes for his father too.
 So if there's other tests that need to be run,
 let's abandon this one.
  </li><li>Right, and go for the ones that small children can do.
 At least his vision is good.
 He's apparently gotten my vision.
 He's good to go.
 I don't like what you're instillulating.
 Well, you may not like what I'm instillulating, but the facts are your blind is
 about without your glasses and it turns out our girls aren't much better.
 Abby's vision got worse and well, because she hasn't been wearing her glasses,
 but her glasses when we got her glasses, they were for distance and she was only
 supposed to wear them if she was looking at a chalkboard.
 And now she's supposed to wear glasses all the time.
 Yeah, it's pretty worrying at church this morning.
 Our kids were in for worship.
 Let's revisit that idea.
 But our kids were in for worship and we sat in the front row and the big screen had our
 declarations and Abigail couldn't read the declaration.
 Yeah, that's terrifying.
 Mm-hmm.
 Because I can read it from the very back.
 Yeah, but you're some sort of grateful that you can see the future.
 It's not right.
 Yeah.
 And your mom's arrived.
 She has.
 She drove 14 hours from Canada.
 So she did it over a two day span.
 She just stayed somewhere near Cincinnati or something, and she arrived this evening.
 So she's 80, and she drives here from Canada.
 That's pretty impressive.
 She's something else.
 She's amazing.
 Yeah.
 And then there was this handsome Scottish gorgeous man who spoke at church this morning.
 I think he had an athletic build.
 Definitely a chilly handsome.
 That's the one.
 Incredibly humble.
 Very humble.
 I missed him.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yep.
 Yeah.
 No, you were great this morning.
 It was really, really good.
 Speaking on the kindness of God.
 Say that again, but louder.
 Speaking of the kindness I've got.
 I know the very good part.
 It was great.
 I seriously, I highly recommend that you can you can watch it on grace.
 And can you put a link in the show?
 I can put a link.
 If you're going to watch one of them, watch the second session.
 Yeah, it was funnier.
 Oh, thanks.
 Yeah, apparently don't watch the first one.
 No giggles, no laughs.
 Well, there was a couple of giggles and laughs, but I think by the time you get to
 second service, those people have had more espresso.
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Our topic for this week. I mean, thinking about wisdom a lot,
 actually spoke about it at Ammonate on Monday night. And if you were there, what we're doing
 tonight is we're launching something very, very cool. But before we do that, I want to do a little
 bit of a recap of what we talked about on Monday night at Ammonate. But being thinking about wisdom,
 being thinking about the book of Proverbs, so enjoying Proverbs, I've been reading it and
 just digging out all this treasure. I think Proverbs was written to be tweeted.
 It's very tweet-worthy or it's easy to tweet, isn't it? It really is. So we have a cunning plan
 of what we want to do, but we're going to tell you about that in a second. Let's recap what we
 talked about Monday night. Okay. One of the first things that you mentioned was that the fear of
 the Lord is the foundation of wisdom, and that's from Proverbs 9, 10. But I think that word fear
 fear there is more awe, isn't it, than like terror?
 Yeah, it's an interesting phrase, isn't it, "fear of the Lord"?
 What brings to mind when you hear that?
 I think because my paradigm isn't that God is scary, but that God is loving and kind.
 Fear there, to me, is more our reverence of the Lord rather than a terror of the Lord,
 or constantly being afraid.
 But I know people that read that verse like that.
 In a moment, we're going to be talking about some videos we highly recommend you watch
 on the book of Proverbs, and they do a great job of explaining that phrase.
 But basically that whole thing of the fear of the Lord is the foundation of wisdom.
 It's really rooted in the idea that you find wisdom in listening and obeying God's word.
 That a healthy respect to prioritize God's ways over our ways, even when we don't understand
 his ways, is the foundation of wisdom.
 And I think that's borne out when you see world leaders make decisions that are rooted
 in God's word.
 You see the fruit of that in a global scale.
 And we see that in our own lives.
 When we, time and time again, when we are doing counseling with people, the areas where
 people went off the rails in their life is when they stopped following the way God designed
 life.
 And we see that in our society.
 see stuff crumbling in the areas that we ignore God's ways and flourishing in the areas that
 we see God's ways.
 Right. And typically in those areas we're not teachable either.
 Yeah. Oh my gosh. The whole topic of teachability. You know that, well, we're going to come to
 that in a second, but that whole notion of people who are teachable become wise and people
 who aren't stay fools. Yeah.
 I've really been gripped with the thought of I don't want to be foolish.
 No, me neither.
 I mean, really you get this healthy,
 I don't wanna say fear as in I'm frightened,
 but this healthy, all-in-revernance reading scriptures
 that you've got two choices, either be wise or be a fool.
 And I'm like, Lord, I don't wanna be a fool.
  </li><li>Yeah, and I guess I think sometimes,
 I'm pretty sure that most fools don't realize
 they're being fools, they probably think they're being wise.
  </li><li>Well, it talks about like if you take stock
 and you're in wisdom, you're a fool.
 I'm like,
 (laughing)
 Oh, Lord, help me.
 The second thing I pointed out was,
 and this was super encouraging,
 is that wisdom is available to everyone.
 It's actually really easy to find.
 And that's a relief because I think sometimes
 it's a danger that we think that we're destined to be
 a fool or destined to be wise.
 Or we look at people in our own lives that we think,
 oh man, they're really wise, I wish I was like them,
 not realizing we could become like them
 if we would just do what they do.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
 Your third point was that you can acquire wisdom
 listening. So one of the best things that can happen to you is actually to get rebuked
 or corrected. If your heart's actually willing to listen, you can acquire wisdom.
 But how genius is that of God to wrap up wisdom in a rebuke? One of the easiest means
 of communication to dismiss. Yeah. Where it would actually require humility to be able
 to engage with God on that level.
 But great rewards from receiving.
 You know, even I remember many times I would have, you know, especially at the beginning
 of the renewal and stuff like that.
 And there was a lot to be rebuked for.
 You know, there was a lot, there's a lot of need of correction as I was learning to lead
 and all that kind of stuff.
 But I felt like I got corrected a lot.
  </li><li>Like what do you mean?
  </li><li>Well, I mean, I joke around about don't punch people
 at church 'cause I did and of course got corrected for that.
 But just, you know, learning to love other people well,
 being more patient with people, that kind of stuff.
 And I remember sort of determining in my heart, okay,
 even if I don't agree with the feedback that I'm getting
 or the rebuke that I'm getting from someone,
 I'm still going to take it before the Lord and ask him to talk to me about it because
 I don't actually want to miss something just because I don't view myself in that way.
 I want to actually, I want to grow.
 And I figured the only way you grow is by actually including other people's perspectives.
 Well, that was one of the things the Lord spoke to me a couple of weeks ago.
 We were on vacation, weren't we?
 And we had this heated interchange one night.
 I think we're getting ready to pack up and leave.
 And we had this heated interchange.
 I thought it went one way and you thought it went a completely different way.
 Yeah.
 And we were getting nowhere going, no, that's not what I said.
 That's not what I meant.
 And the Holy Spirit said to me, Alan, there's only two eyewitnesses in the room.
 And you're not taking the report of the other eyewitness seriously.
 And I was like, you know what, Lord, you're absolutely right.
 And I began thinking, why would my wife lie to me?
 Like you were so earnestly trying to communicate something to me.
 I wasn't listening because I, in my head, I was like, I was there.
 I know what happened.
 And I just felt the alerts and just shut up and listen to your wife, just like
 be quiet and actually listen to what she's saying.
 And I was a stoner.
 It's going to sound terrible.
 I was astonished that when I actually listened, I heard something so
 contrary to my view of how things went down, but I just thought she's not going to lie to me.
 Yeah.
 Like if I want to grow, I need to listen to what she's saying.
 This was before we ever did the teaching on wisdom, but I'd been reading Proverbs.
 So I guess something had sunk in.
 Yeah.
 And, uh, yeah, what did you, what did you, did you notice I did that?
 Yeah.
 And I actually thought it was unusual.
 I mean, I mean, thankfully we don't argue that often, but it, uh, you sort of
 this, uh, what's the word I'm looking for?
 Just qualify.
 No, no, no, you, you like, you turned on a dime and just sort of went, well, hang on a second.
 I, well, okay, let me, I want to hear you because, you know, and you said that you're the, you're
 the other person in the room. And so, you know, and I was sort of like, like, I didn't know to begin
 with why you were taking that tack. If I was trying to trap you. Yeah. And I was like, uh,
 okay. Well, it's the Holy Spirit. It's a genius. I remember Jeff Dallar, our beloved pastor in
 leader said, I have a bald spot that I can't see. Like other people can tell me if a ball
 swap. But if I take the stance that, well, I can't see it there, if I don't have one,
 I'm going to miss out on valuable feedback. Yeah.
 Danny Silks said this brilliant thing. He said, you know, we all have a nose right above where
 our breath comes out. But none of us can tell if we have good or bad breath. We need other people
 to give us valuable feedback about what's going on. And so this whole premise that we acquire
 wisdom by listening to other people. I mean, there's something to that.
 Yeah.
 This week I was having lunch with a friend and I was there for maybe like an hour.
 And as we were leaving, in passing, he just happened to say something.
 Literally we're getting out of the booth to walk out of the restaurant and he said
 something. And I was so struck by it.
 I think I'd just been meditating on this whole listening thing that I felt like he
 was giving me a rebuke in a gentle way.
 And so I stopped and said, can we sit back down again?
 Tell me what you're trying to tell me because I want to hear what you have to say.
 I think this whole revelation that you hear wisdom from God through other people
 is is is blowing away.
 And sometimes it's disguised in the voices of people.
 You might not choose to look for wisdom from.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, for sure.
 All right.
 The last thing I mentioned is really, really simple, but it's found all the way through
 scripture and it's that the wise get wise by listening, the foolish ignore wisdom at their peril.
 Which again, when you read the Proven, Proven is going to be one of the most accessible books
 in the Bible. So utterly profound yet so easy to read and understand and actually apply.
 Yeah, I think this, you know, that point, number four is probably the most painful thing to watch
 as a pastor is like, oh, you're ignoring wisdom and you're making a decision that I know you're
 going to pay for.
 Right.
 And I so want to help you not make that decision, but you're actually not looking for counsel.
 You're only looking for agreement and I can't give you that, you know, and then you just
 watch, you know, destruction, and it's, it's the thing I weep the most over is watch
 watching people that I love make decisions that I know are going to cost them.
 And just like, why can't you hear?
 What is it that can't hear that this isn't a good decision?
 I think we have to get to a place where we want wisdom more than our own way.
 Yeah.
 I think that's right, babe.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Anyway, this is getting really deep, really late.
 Yeah.
 It wasn't supposed to be deep and late.
 No.
 Here's what we're going to do.
 It's I want to do this in July, but apparently we moved out and couldn't do it at the same time.
 I know.
 I don't know what we're thinking.
 We want to do something we're calling wisdom 31.
 It's 31 days of a social media wisdom journey.
 The idea behind it is that we are all going to read a chapter of proverbs every day for 31 days.
 Yeah.
 Starting with the 1st of August.
 Now, if you have to listen to this and it's the 5th of August or the 10th of August, just jump straight in.
 The ideas we're going to read at chapter of Proverbs for the date that it is.
 So it's the 13th of August, read chapter 13 of Proverbs all the way through August 31st.
 Anything that jumps out to you from that day's reading, we want you to share on social media
 using the hashtag wisdom 31.
 That's the word wisdom and the number three and the number one.
 And the idea is that as we're all reading it together, we're all having people share what's jumping out to them.
 and we get to listen to other people's perspectives of what impacted them.
 Now, I think I'm so excited about this.
 I think this is going to be awesome.
 Are we posting on Instagram or on Twitter or both anywhere?
 Anywhere, just hashtag wisdom 31.
 Yeah, I checked Twitter, Instagram and Facebook and nobody has yet used that hashtag.
 So it's all going to be ours.
 Perfect.
 Here's what I'm going to encourage you to do before even starting that.
 But there is an amazing website called the Bible project dot com, which I can't recommend
 highly enough to you.
 The idea is that they're creating video introductions for all of the books of the Bible and all
 the major themes of the Bible.
 I mean, the quality in these videos is astonishing.
 The production quality is unbelievable.
 They really are so good.
 And the scholarly work behind it is super accessible, super brilliant.
 There's two videos I want to encourage you to watch.
 The first video, and I put a link to this in the show notes, is it's an introduction
 to the wisdom literature in scripture.
 So there's three main books of the Bible that we talk about as being the wisdom literature,
 the book of Job, the book of Proverbs, and the book of Ecclesiastics.
 This five and a half minute video gives you an overview of all three books, including
 the book of Proverbs.
 It's going to be really helpful for you to read that.
 Then, and again, this link is going to be in the show notes.
 I want you to watch the introduction to the book of Proverbs.
 It's also, it's about eight minutes.
 I guarantee you it's the best 14 minutes that you can spend on the internet.
 Yeah, that sounds awesome.
 I, uh, I've really enjoyed all the Bible project videos.
 I think they're super helpful with laying a foundation for how to read whatever book it is.
 I mean, they've, they've done so many of the different books in the Bible.
 They're amazing work.
 Yeah.
 And they're interesting.
 Like they're not boring at all.
 I've, I, every single one that I've watched, I've walked more than once just because they're so well done.
 So what we're going to do, just to recap, is we're going to read a chapter of
 Proverbs every day, whatever chapter is of the day of the month that we're on.
 And then post to Instagram, Twitter or Facebook, any of the verses that actually
 stand out to you.
 So you can just straight tweet it or you can get super creative, but just
 hashtag it wisdom 31 so that everybody else can see the posts and be encouraged
 by one another as we're reading through Proverbs together.
 I think it'll be super fun.
 And if you don't need to follow us on social media, we're just @allen and AJ on all channels.
 A-L-Y-N-A-N-D-A-J.
 Yeah, and we can't wait to read what wisdom you guys receive.
 All right, well, that's it for this week.
