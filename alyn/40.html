<p> How was your week, darling?<br/>
 It was a very interesting week.<br/>
 Full of not a lot of sleep and being stuck in the house because of the ice
 apocalypse that has happened in Frank.
 And do you know what else is weird?<br/>
 What is because we're jet lagged?<br/>
 Well, throw in a pinch of jet lag.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And throw in a pinch of our schedule, be completely disorganized because
 school was canceled for the kids.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Church was canceled for us.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And because our days have largely been spent trying to wake up and work out where we are,
 I've felt like this week has gone by really, really slowly.
 It has felt very, so it's nice to have had time to recover in terms of the jet lag
 that the kids didn't have to go right back to school or whatever.
 Poor sweet Tia keeps falling asleep on the couch after dinner and she's like, "I'm so tired.
 I just wanna sleep."<br/>
 big brown eyes. But yeah, I mean, it was, but I think, um, was that five days? We've been in the
 house for five days, basically. And that's because natural scene unprecedented weather.
 Yes, very, very unusual weather. So they got snow and then they got ice. And it's legit.
 Normally use a couple of times. You mock the snowpocalypse. I do normally. But this time
 time it's been pretty legit. Legit-a-man ice, yeah. And they don't have the equipment
 to get rid of it. So three inches of ice. Right. And you can't buy salt anywhere. I tried
 to buy salt a bunch of different places. They're like, "Oh, there might be some of the
 tractor supply plates." And I was like, "Okay." Where, you know, Canada, you can buy it anywhere.
 Whole Foods has sell salt. Not that kind of salt. Just not the quantities you need.
 He might out there with a little shaker.
 Our kids are really gotten to Nintendo.
 We, especially this week, what we've been inside, which is made for
 interesting conversations.<br/>
 It has because if you don't actually watch the game, our conversations sound
 like stay near bubble.<br/>
 Don't jump off the side.<br/>
 Become a cat.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 We're just going to kill ourselves and start over.
 But they're really into it, which is great for me because being into it mostly means
 them watching me play and helping me figure out the puzzles.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Which they're really good at.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And they like live and die with you.<br/>
 They yell when things go well and they scream when you die.
 Well, it helps that every time I finish a level, I give them chocolate.
 Did you know that was happening?<br/>
 No.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Well, that was happening.<br/>
 So they're very motivated for me to finish a level.
 Oh my gosh.<br/>
 It's all starting to make sense.<br/>
 Even muggins, you gave muggins chocolate?
 Yeah, of course.<br/>
 I think that's why he wants to play yeah yeah you gave him a controller today that wasn't working didn't you see the good pretend he was playing so cute.
 Do you know my favorite thing about playing Mario was this week.
 What driving your wife insane no was to you so there's a point in the game where when we're playing multiplayer and they often play with me which is actually more stress than it's worth.
 Actually it's worth their joy so it's anyway they get very excited they get very excited about it.
</p><ul>
  <li>It's very useless, completely useless.
  </li><li>It's not like a team sport,
 you're dragging them through the level.
  </li><li>But so we play in this point
 where we all have to hit something at the same time.
 And Zadiyya says, "Okay, daddy,
 "on three with me."
 I was like, "Okay."
 She says, "Three."
 And she jumps.
 (laughing)
 She didn't understand what she did, that was so funny.
 And then just in time, the nusses in Germany,
 thank you so much.
  </li><li>Thank you.
 a gigantic care package filled with richer German chocolate, most of which is gone.
 Yeah, and you ate all the milk. You didn't share any of it with me.
 Here's the rules. When chocolate arrives in the house, it is every man for himself.
 I'm given I'm the only man in the house.
 Oh, it's that out works. I'm going to need to buy my own gun safe.
 You know, being home alone has been pretty nice simply because I think I spent five days
 in pajamas.
 And when I get bored, I cook.
 And when you get bored, you cook and you come up with some pretty delightful things.
 You've been on a Thai train recently.
 I just love Thai flavors.
 Like I love...
 You made a Tomcat guy soup today.
 Mm-hmm.
 And I might not be pronouncing that right.
 I think that's how you pronounce it.
 How did you come up with that recipe?
  </li><li>That was a, I was driving home from having checked out
 the parking lot at church to see if we could have school.
 And as I was driving, I just tasted that.
 Okay, it was just like, oh, I want that.
 And I thought, oh, it's gotta be, I don't know,
 chicken stock, coconut milk, red.
 So I just started thinking and I stopped at Whole Foods
 and got some chicken stock and just came home
 and started making it.
 And then I just kept tasting it until it tasted
 like what I wanted it to taste like.
 So I just kept throwing things in it until it was like,
 oh, that's what I want.
  </li><li>I have no wing of that.
  </li><li>That sort of thing, yep.
  </li><li>And then last night--
  </li><li>I keep the noots and the bats and the garage there.
  </li><li>Well, they're all organic, you know, from my first aisle 13.
  </li><li>Mm, mm, mm.
  </li><li>That's amazing.
 (laughing)
 And then didn't last night you make some Thai curry as well?
 A green curry.
  </li><li>I did a made of green curry.
 I don't usually make green curry, but I did last night.
  </li><li>That was delicious.
  </li><li>It was really good.
  </li><li>What else did you make this week that I liked?
  </li><li>Well, hopefully, darling, you liked all of it.
  </li><li>No, I did, but there was something else
 that I was like, that was delicious.
  </li><li>I made you some interesting breakfast things
 like sweet potato hash with beef bacon,
 which we've just found.
  </li><li>Mm, you made the kids' porridge this morning.
  </li><li>They did not like porridge.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>No, they're poor little faces.
 Tea is big brown eyes looking at me and she's like,
 Mummy. I do not like this. And I was like, honey, it's so good because I put wild blueberries
 and maple syrup and cinnamon into the porridge. That's where you went wrong. The only thing you
 should put in porridge is milk and syrup. There's not a chance they would eat it. It looks like
 gruel or something you'd serve to a prison inmate. Again, apologies to the nation of Scotland.
 That's my wife just the texture.
 I couldn't get him to eat it.
 I made, I got him to have about six spoonfuls, but because I did different
 vehicles, he would open his mouth.
 So I was like, okay, I'm going to do a car, beep, beep, burn for him.
 And then I go open your mouth and I'll do another vehicle.
 So he'd eat it, but then he'd frown at me the whole time he was chewing it.
 And then I did a car, I did a car, a bus.
 No, no, please continue.
 This is fascinating.
 I did plane.
 I do my deck.
 I'm stuck.
 You might notice it's not a vehicle, but.
 And my mom, I'm sure everybody wants to know how my mom is doing.
 My mom has contained to confuse the doctors as her.
 What is it called?
 Platelets.
 Platelets went from 6 to 20.
 I mean, they should be 150.
 But they went to 20, which was amazing.
 No faction, no pain, no broken bones.
 She says, "Chirpies can be spooked her today.
 You know, it's remarkable."
 It is remarkable.
 So keep praying for my mom.
 Everybody keeps coming up to me when I see them.
 So we're praying for a moment.
 I'm like, "Thank you so much."
 Baby, do you know what our main topic is today?
 What is our main topic today?
 Absolutely nothing.
 We are topicless.
 I'd like to see more of you topicless.
 Oh, dear.
 Ooh, Jan, I want to cut that out, keep that in.
 I'm keeping it in.
 It's too good.
 We're married I get to see topic list okay moving on.
 No there's more I can look for more.
 Well I thought we do some listeners questions I also couldn't think of a topic and I thought I'm not going to make up a topic for the sake of making up a topic.
 We haven't seen anybody this week so we can't talk about anybody.
 It's been sad actually it's sad when you go away for you know whatever 10 13 days we were away something like that.
 And I haven't seen people like I haven't seen my friends or I'm living vicariously through Instagram.
 I know and I just about cried when church was cancelled.
 Me too. I was like, no, what is everyone? Yeah.
 But we get to see everybody tomorrow. Yes.
 And we're super excited that David Wagner. Yeah, come on.
 So if you listen to this, you live in Nashville or if you listen to this, you don't live in Nashville.
 If you stream emanate tomorrow night, you'll be able to watch David Wagner.
 Yep.
 Which is going to be awesome.
 Um, I've got two list of questions for you.
 Both are amazing.
 Okay.
 The first one is from OSA.
<strong>OSA?</strong>
 Yep.
 Okay.
 And OSA says this, I am listening to Roland Baker right now.
 And he mentioned dropping or giving everything to Jesus.
 And if you're going to do this Christian thing, you have to be willing to give it all dreams, ambition, family, all of it.
 I'm currently in college pursuing a career in medicine.
 My heart keeps going back to this one need to be a physician.
 It's a lot of hard work and I've been told how much it will take over my life,
 but I cannot see myself doing anything else.
 However, I want to go after God and know him and understand when he moves and how he moves.
 Can I walk in the spirit and pursue something as demanding as medicine at the same time?
 Yes.
 Yes, you can.
 I just I wasn't laughing at the question.
 I was laughing at your simplistic answer.
 Yes.
 We should probably explain that we don't see any dividing line between the spiritual and the secular.
 So I got called into full-time ministry the day the Lord asked me to be a teacher and he meant a school teacher.
 And the reason I was in full-time ministry was because I didn't want to be a teacher and the only reason I was doing it is because the Lord said I'd like you to do that.
 And I think that whatever you're in, whatever the Lord put before you, do it really, really well.
 Yeah, as a Christian, no matter where you are or what you do as a profession, you're in full-time ministry.
 Right. And God needs Christian doctors. He needs Christian architects and Christian school teachers.
 Christian models. It sounds like it's something also that you have long to do.
 You know, this isn't like a flash in the pan thing. This is something that's been
 written on your heart that you're pursuing as a result of that. And so I think often God speaks
 to us through the desires of our hearts as well. You know, Matthew 10, Jesus calls us disciples
 and he gives them five simple things to do, to go and preach a good news, to heal a sick,
 to cleanse a leper, to raise the dead and cast out demons.
 And I think so long as you're doing those things, no matter where you are, you're fulfilling
 the mandate of the kingdom of heaven.
 So...
 And being in a hospital, you'll be able to see many of those things whenever you want.
 It's amazing.
 But it took me a long time to realize that often when you're looking for God's will,
 He's often asking you what would you like his will to be?
 If that makes sense, if that doesn't sound ridiculous.
 What I mean by that is Bill Johnson is a great way.
 He says, "God wants your mind renewed so your will could be done."
 Because I think if you delight yourself in the Lord, he gives you the desires of your
 heart.
 So if you're following, if you're simultaneously seeking first his kingdom, then everything
 else gets added to you.
 And so I think as long as your heart is to see God's kingdom built, then whatever you're
 doing do and of God tells you to do something different, do something different. But I don't
 think that you are in contrast. And I think when Rollins is talking about dropping everything,
 of course, if God comes to you and says, I don't want you to do this, give up this and do that,
 then that's great. But sometimes he calls people to give up something else and become doctors.
 And so, yes, I think you're doing a great thing and you absolutely can walk in the spirit and
 pursue something as demanding as medicine at the same time.
 Yeah.
 Next question is from Chris.
 Hi, Chris.
 Brilliant question.
 How does someone who wants full deep healing, but who has missed the time and the attention and flexibility of youth get more?
 How do I go deep into Jesus in the middle of having to function at a higher level?
 I am married.
 I have kids.
 I'm an executive.
 I want to dive into the resources I see around me like schools and training, but my time and my emotional capacity are limited to do the things.
 I see others do. So for fun, I will ask, what would you tell President Obama to do if he said to you?
 I want to get really deep with Jesus, but after praying over, he wants me to do that while being president.
 That's a good question, Chris.
 I mean, I think at its, at its most basic answer would be this.
 Talk to the Lord about it.
 Like talk to the Lord about your desire for healing and your desire for training and ask him to open
 doors and then be quick to run through what he opens for you.
 Be quick to respond when he brings up issues that he wants to deal with and he wants to
 heal your heart.
 Go after the things that you can go after that are within the time that you have available
 to do it.
 And then there's probably going to be times where the Lord says, "Hey, I want you to choose
 to do this and ask and see if you can."
 I don't think because you're busy and because you're a professional, it means you therefore
 forfeit the ability to have the training or the healing that you want.
 I think it's more the creativity of listening to God and just saying, "Lord, this is really
 my desire."
 In addition to that, you've called me to work and provide for my family and whatever.
 you show me how to make this work? Would you open up opportunities for me? And would you help me
 to be quick to respond? Right. I have a friend back in Scotland who's an executive and the volume
 of teaching he gets through is amazing because he drives a lot or maybe you fly a lot and he
 just listens to podcasts or teaching CDs, teaching material and he gets fed that way. When you ask
 me that question, I thought of the verse Psalm 16 verse 7 says, "I will praise the Lord who
 counsels me even at night my heart instructs me. And I remember a season of my life. It's
 slightly different from what you're describing. But basically I wanted to grow in the prophetic,
 but I didn't know any prophets. And I didn't know anybody who teach me in the prophetic.
 And so your thing is I'm short on time. My thing was I was short on teachers. I didn't
 know any prophets or where to get teaching. And so the Lord would actually send me prophets
 in my dreams who would teach me. So, you know, you're asleep for maybe seven, eight hours
 a night. That verse says that the Lord can instruct you and cancel your heart at night.
 So the amount of revelation I got through my dreams was incredible. And certainly, you
 know, the prophets that came and taught me I've never met in real life. I would pay, you
 know, large sums of money to go to their conferences and hear them. But I never could
 have lived in Scotland. They all lived in America. And God has kind of sent them to me and they
 taught me a ton of stuff that even today I teach out of. So I think if you just present
 your waking hours and your sleeping hours to the Lord, he's so good at doing things.
 And also be encouraged when you look at a lot of heroes of the faith, the two that
 spring of mine, for example, Joseph and Daniel, both of them were high, high level executives.
 Joseph was the second most powerful person in all of Egypt, and yet he had a rich, vibrant
 relationship with the Lord and you think of Daniel as well and you know similar sort of thing and I
 think if you just say Lord would you redeem my time then he's just so good and you get to practice
 things like words of knowledge and ministering the power of the Holy Spirit in a unique context so
 the other thing I would say is in your relationships, cultivate relationships with people who are a
 little further along the line than you want to be because some of that stuff rubs off you know I
 I forget who it was that said that you become the lowest common denominator of the people
 who you hang around with, but hang around with people you want to be like.
 And some of the stuff you want is caught rather than taught.
 I'm done.
 I have nothing else to say.
 That was it.
 That's it.
 That's all I've got.
 That was like the depth of your well of wisdom right there.
 It's, you know, I haven't seen anybody.
 I need to hang around other people.
 So it all rubs off for me.
 We need people folks.
 It's too introvert sitting here saying we need people.
 You know it's desperate then.
  </li><li>What's happening this week?
  </li><li>David Wagner's coming to teach on the school
 and emanate.
  </li><li>Love David Wagner.
  </li><li>Which is fantastic.
 The kiddies are going back to school.
  </li><li>On Tuesday.
  </li><li>On Tuesday.
  </li><li>There's Mondays, it's a snow day.
  </li><li>Tomorrow is a ice day or something.
 Yes, the schools are closed not because of the roads
 but because the parking lots of the schools
 are filled with ice and the buses can't get in and out.
 So there you go.
 Strange things happen here in Nashville, Tennessee.
 What time is it in Edinburgh, Scotland?
 In Edinburgh, Scotland, it's 3.22 AM.
 Oh, that's why I feel tired.
 Ladies and gentlemen, that's why this week is the shortest podcast ever.
 I'm sorry.
 I hope it wasn't like horrible, but it is what it is because I'm so tired.
 We will see you next week for a better podcast.
 We love you.
