<p> I live in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is a j jones episode 91 how the heck are you so good are you you look amazing do you know that.
 Thank you yeah and you've only got eyeshadow on.
 I should I should.<br/>
 I should say close.<br/>
 I shadow no way this conversation can get better I'm buying out you look very pretty tonight.
 Thank you.<br/>
 You're seeing one end of our podcast table.
 I'm single the end of the other.<br/>
 It feels lonely without Gary and Sarah here.
 I know.<br/>
 It's very quiet as well.<br/>
 Poor MJ woke up the next morning and he's like, "Where's Tobias?"
 We're like, "Baby, they've gone back to Australia."
 Why?<br/>
 Yeah, our friends Gary and Sarah who were with us last week on our podcast flew back to
 Australia this weekend.<br/>
 What an incredible week we've had.<br/>
 Seriously, this whole podcast could just be a review of the week we had.
 For certain.<br/>
 an amazing week. You know what I want to start off with? I want to give a bit of feedback to the
 tail end of last week's podcast. If you haven't listened to last week's podcast, dear Lord,
 stop what you're doing right now. Go to allenaj.com/90 and listen to last week's podcast because it
 was amazing. During last week's podcast, we were just recording like we are now, no retouched
 anything and everything stopped. It's not that the power went out, it's just that everything cut out,
 Yeah, which was so odd. What was odd or was Gary was like, man, that was crazy. And I was like, yeah, it's so weird that it just stopped working.
 It's like, no, no, when it stopped working, I just saw the name Heather.
 And I was like, oh, that's weird. And so if you listen to last week's podcast, you'll hear that by supernatural means Gary heard a name.
 He got a date of birth, a profession and a country.
 Yes. So we were like, oh, this is fun. Put it on tape, see what happens.
 Yes.<br/>
 And what happens is we got feedback from the person.
 So she says, "This week I saw God break into my ordinary everyday life in a very extraordinary way.
 While going about a normal working day, I got a message from Nashville,
 from folks that I met while visiting Gray Center Church with the following incredible story.
 When they were recording their weekly podcast, interviewing two friends who were visiting from Australia,
 suddenly all of the recording equipment cut out and stopped working.
 When the recording weirdly stopped, Gary Morgan weirdly received a word of
 knowledge, prophetic word from God.<br/>
 Details he received were Heather, November 10th, which is her birthday,
 and involved in some sort of social work, which is her profession and Scotland,
 which is where she lives.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 So he went on to share what he felt like God wanted him to say to that person
 and shared an encouraging message relating to work, every detail was totally accurate.
 It totally blows my mind that God would shut down the recording equipment, give a complete
 stranger on the other side of the world such accurate information, and give him an encouraging
 message for me.<br/>
 I am totally undone by both the greatness and the goodness of God.
 An ordinary day became an extraordinary day when God showed me the lengths he is willing
 to go to remind me that I am seen, known and loved by him.
 It's one of the most consistent feedback we had this week from people who had heard
 Gary and Sarah minister, either Grace and her or M&amp;A or the school.
 And of course, everybody was impacted by the accuracy of the prophetic revelation.
 But more than that, people were touched by the kindness of God.
 And for me, every time they would minister, Gary and Sarah would minister, I would just
 start weeping because the tangible presence of the kindness of God came into the room,
 that he would care about people. Like Heather just said, that he would care enough to interrupt
 your podcast, to give somebody who is born in Wales, who lives in Australia, who I've never met,
 random information about me to call me out and then prophesy all these details into my life.
 It's just incredible.<br/>
 Yeah. It was super fun to watch them both on the school together, tag teaming and everything and
 and profsang over people and calling people out there as well.
 Like it was just, it was really in depth.
</p><ul>
  <li>And if all of this sounds a little bit weird to you,
 first Corinthians 12 verse eight describes what's going on.
 It's called a word of knowledge.
 And the NASB it says this,
 "For to one is given the word of wisdom through the spirit
 and to another the word of knowledge
 according to the same spirit."
 I think it's funny how, you know,
 we're, because some of the feedback I had from people was like,
 this is so weird.
 Like some people were uncomfortable.
 And it's funny how we want God to move,
 but when God does move, we're suddenly uncomfortable with it.
 Or according to that verse,
 we're fine when people give us wisdom.
 Like we really love listening to wise people thinking,
 "Ah, it's amazing."
 But we get suddenly uncomfortable when we move from wisdom
 to word of knowledge.
 The NIV says it like this.
 It says, "To one there is given through the spirit,
 a message of wisdom, to another, a message of knowledge
 by means of the same spirit."
 So basically, it's just a message from the Holy Spirit
 about something.
 And I think this is one of the reasons I love our school.
 I mean, I loved that our church got to experience
 Gary and Sarah for a Sunday morning.
 But what I love more is that on Monday and Tuesday
 our students get another six and a half hours of them.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I think it's amazing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I also thought it was interesting
 how many school students got picked out
 on the Sunday morning as well.
  </li><li>Right.
 Either students or graduates.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 which I mean, I don't want to draw any principles from that, but it was alarming that the percentage
 of, and I don't know what that means. I don't know if that has something to do with what
 we're going to be talking about later or not, but it was certainly interesting.
 Yeah, I don't know.
 And on Monday morning, man, that was crazy. First thing, Monday morning at a school,
 it's worship. And so Gary says that often in worship, all these words of knowledge just
 come to him. He writes him down on a piece of paper or in this case, on an iPad and just
 calls them out. And he called it a bunch of people's names and dates. But the most outlandish
 one, I think for me, was when he stood up and he said, "Hey, I've got a seven digit number,"
 which I think must be a phone number. If we add the area code that's a 10 digit number,
 is this anyone's phone number? Stands up, reads out a 10 digit number, and our friend,
 Alison Hendrickson, that you may remember from episode 76 and 77, she stood up and she said,
 That's my phone number.
 Yeah.
 So then Gary calls her out, gives her an amazingly detailed word, and then Alison
 Hendrickson turned the tables on us, babe.
 Tell us what happened.
 Well, it was crazy.
 Okay.
 So Alison Hendrickson had a dream a week before that he called her out.
 And she was calling him according to her caller ID, but she didn't know why in the dream.
 And he didn't answer.
 And when it switched to voicemail, the Holy Spirit said there was no need to leave a message
 that Gary has your number and he has a message for you.
 I spoke to Alison this afternoon because I wanted to make sure the story was right.
 And she said, "So seven days before she gets called out by her telephone number, she has that dream."
 And she said, "I was so ready for the Lord to speak to me that I had my phone out,
 set to a voice record, set to record whatever prophetic word he was going to be."
 Never did I think he'd been calling out by my phone number.
 That's awesome. Yeah, it was so cool. And of course they did more prophetic ministry again.
 on Monday night at M&amp;A, which was fantastic.
 I think really he was 100% in terms of the word of knowledge.
 Well, that's the crazy thing.
 Between Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday,
 he came in and ministered to our staff.
 There must have been close to 50 words of knowledge,
 be it names, addresses, phone numbers, dates, anniversaries.
 And to my recollection, to my counting, 100% accuracy.
 accuracy. So I'd never seen that level of accuracy or that level of consistency.
 And then the other thing is, there's a whole of stuff that was off the cuff, off the
 microphone. You know, we'd just be sitting in a restaurant with him or we'd be at church
 or we'd be driving around. And he would just lean over and say, Hey, I think that person's
 name is. And of course, we would know the person would like, yeah, it didn't happen
 this trip. But one of my funny stories was last time over here, two years ago, we were
 driving around and Gary wanted to use my cell phone to tether his phone to, you know, to
 access data. So we're in the car and he says, "Hey, Al, can I, can I tether off your phone?"
 I'm like, "Sure." But I was driving so I didn't want to unlock my phone. So I just handed him
 my phone and he just turned on tethering. And it was only after about five minutes I realized,
 I have a passcode on my phone that he didn't ask for. And when I was like, "Hey," I think
 it's like, I just thought it'd be easier than asking you.
 I remember, this is a number of years ago now, probably 10 years ago or so. But we had just
 checked into a hotel and he and Sarah were coming to the hotel to pick us up.
 And he just showed up at our room.
 And so we were like, Hey, uh, you know,
 could you stop by the front desk?
 Yeah.
 Cause we hadn't sent him the room number or anything like we said, we would.
 Cause we just got there and he said, no, I just have to Holy Spirit and came to the room.
 So I was like, okay.
 So we just had a great time with them.
 Gary and Sarah, thank you for coming over and blessing all our peeps and
 blessing us. It was amazing. Totally amazing. And then of course they flew home and got
 home in time for church on Sunday. I cannot imagine how jet lag they feel. Oh my gosh.
 Yeah. Yeah. So if you haven't listened to their podcast yet, listen to it's Alan and
 aj.com/90. It will be one of the craziest podcasts you've listened to. I can guarantee
 it. So you're right, baby. On Thursday, we dropped them off at the airport, but in doing
 So we stumbled upon a little gem.
 We did.
 We sort of did a moving date day on Thursday, didn't we?
 As our final day.
 So we took them to crema because they hadn't been there yet.
 And they'd heard about crema, which they loved.
 And of course we started off the day with five daughters, donuts and Franklin
 Jews. So, you know, we were already doing well.
 We're hitting the highlights.
 Yeah.
 And then our friend, Deb Borde, told us about this place in 12 South
 called Bartaco.
 Yes.
 And any restaurant in the service tacos, I have to go to.
 It's a good decision.
 If there's tacos on the menu, I'm going to order it.
 But this is a whole restaurant devoted to tacos.
 Tell us about your experience.
 It's so good.
 Everything from the atmosphere and the way that the restaurant is decorated
 and what the servers are wearing and everything, it's all very, very consistent.
 Everybody's smiling.
 They feel like they want to be there.
 It's just a great place and then add to that the food is awesome.
 Yeah, I was astonished by the consistency in their branding.
 Yeah, it was really good.
 I didn't realize they have many locations.
 They're not a chain per se.
 They're privately owned, but they have multiple locations in the United States.
 But the level of detail just in the restaurant layout, in the menus, in the way they order,
 which is quite unique.
 But they're, you know, every, it's like somebody is obsessively caring about tiny details and it
 Totally shows. Yeah, even the bathrooms are really lovely. Yeah, but then the food like the food had the three F's. It was fast. It was fresh. It was delicious. That's not right. Yeah, you mean, foolish.
 What are the three F's? Fast, fresh, fantastic.
 friendly i don't know anyway was delicious and the tacos start at two dollars fifty each are you getting me yeah here i'm going to spend all the kids college savings fund right there no no no it was so good it was very good i love that you could buy each taco allocart so you can really tailor it to what you feel like eating what are we go through.
 I had the sesame ribeye.
 I had one of those two.
 I had the baja fish.
 Yes, I had one of those.
 I had the chicken.
 Yeah, Gary had the pork.
 Yeah, pork, pork pastor or something.
 Every one of them was delicious.
 So really good.
 I had a shrimp one that was really good.
 Yeah, we need to go back.
 It was so good.
 It was very good.
 So yeah, if you're in 12 South, you fancy tacos head to Bartaco.
 It was in the corn.
 Baby, you didn't talk about the corn.
 I did not talk about the corn.
 They have this corn and you can get it on the cob or they'll cut it off the
 coffee, which is my preference.
 Cause I don't like picking corn out of my teeth or having all
 smashed in your beard, which isn't a problem for you, but it was
 the least going to say, like, well, I don't have a beard, but thank you
 for that visual.
 Um, oh, it's so good that corn.
 I don't know what they do to it, but it's good.
 You know what's, it's interesting because the night before we ate a very
 well respected chain restaurant that are known for quality, known for
 excellent service known for great food. We had an utterly disappointing experience. It was
 death by a thousand tiny paper cut through. It was so refreshing to go to this privately-owned
 restaurant where just everything was top-notch. I couldn't fault them on anything. I loved it.
 I can't wait to go back. It was so good. Then we came over from church today.
 And we found some... Oh, I forgot to mention gifts and surprises.
 Gifts and surprises. I've given a new Apple TV. Yes, you did. What do you think of the new Apple
 TV, baby. I really like it. I haven't had a chance to play with it very much because you've
 been playing with it. I resemble that statement. But it seems very cool.
 Yeah, it's super fast. A series on it is amazing. I wanted to update it to the beta software,
 but I'm going to wait until I release it. No, no. Well, as all those of new features,
 you're going to love. I don't care. All right, fine. And so, yeah, we got a new Apple TV,
 but we came over from church today and found something else in the doorstep, baby. What
 am I so excited about?
 Well, we found our Amazon things that we just bought.
 Well, I've discovered that every day can feel like a birthday at Amazon.com.
 Yes, we got Monbento lunch boxes.
 Now, these are lunch boxes for grown-ups.
 Yes.
 And yet, why am I so excited about lunch boxes for grown-ups?
 Because the packaging was lovely and they're just beautiful boxes.
 Again, somebody's just decided, I'm going to give my life to making
 lunchboxes. And it's thoughtfully designed, wonderfully crafted. I mean, you've taken out the box,
 they're so tactile, they're a delight to disassemble and assemble.
 Yes. If Apple made lunchboxes, they would be monumental lunchboxes.
 Yes, that's what I was thinking exactly.
 But I had this kind of revelation that they weren't cheap. I mean, they weren't horrendously
 expensive, but they were more than I would have liked to have paid. But when I got them,
 them, suddenly I didn't regret paying for them at all. I just thought I would sooner
 have one set of these than five nasty ones that you could have got a Walmart for the same
 price. The truth is, three or four days of the week, we can't be eating at home because
 we're at work. We spend a lot of money eating out or picking up takeout and whatever, which
 we can save by bringing our lunches, but we just have never gone and gotten the containers
 to be able to do that. It's always been a frustrating event.
 I'm so excited.
 Yeah.
 I know I have already prepped our lunch for tomorrow.
 You're amazing.
 It is ready to go downstairs.
 How are you liking the bed, by the way?
 I love the bed.
 I so good.
 I have grown to love it.
 It's taken me a good week.
 Yeah.
 I couldn't sleep for the first couple nights.
 It was so stinking hard.
 Yeah, but it's great now, isn't it?
 It really is.
 And I don't think it's hard per se.
 I think it was just hard compared to the marshmallow of a mattress
 that kept before her previous mattress was so dismal.
 But you don't wake up in back pain anymore.
 and I sleep through the night.
 That's two bonuses right there.
 Ching, ching.
 But we did find that we needed new pillows, didn't we?
 Because our pillows didn't really go with a nice hard bed.
 They were too thin.
 We found them at Costco.
 We did.
 They're called bamboo pillows, but there's no bamboo in them.
 Yeah, I don't know why they call them bamboo pillows.
 They're quite nice.
 They're fantastic.
 Oh, you've upgraded them from nice to fantastic.
 I love the pillow.
 It's my happy thought.
 You have to understand.
 I've been loyal to the same pillow for about eight years now.
 You just said about like a Canadian and it was adorable.
 All right, our topic for this week is partly Gary and Sarah Morgan's fault.
 Yes.
 We want to talk about being hungry for God.
 Sounds good.
 Because one of the net effects of being around people who are in a different
 realm from you is they suddenly set a new bar of normal for you.
 Yeah.
 And so, you know, being around them and just seeing the ease with which they move
 and the revelation the fathers loves that they carry and the kindness of God that
 that accompanies them. It stirs up something and he doesn't it.
 Yeah, it really does. I was, uh,
 I was, I was bombed on Monday night because I felt like I got a name and a
 number and I didn't give it because I was chicken.
 Out of girl. Yeah. And I was talking to Gary about it. And I was like, Gary,
 I got Carol in 71.
 And he's like, yeah, the tricky things with numbers is that can either be July 1st
 or January 7th. And I was like, yeah,
 well,
 I never really had to encounter the tricky part of that because I didn't open my mouth.
 Oh, well.
 That's awesome, babe.
 Well, maybe.
 Yeah, next time in our ministry, let's go for names and numbers.
 Although here's the thing I appreciate right, Gary, when he was teaching on the school,
 he said, guys, it would be a tragedy if your experience of us being here is that the goal
 of prophetic ministries to reveal names and numbers.
 He said it really isn't the goal of prophetic ministries to reveal the father's heart,
 to reveal the kindness of God, to introduce people to Jesus.
 And I so appreciated him saying that.
  </li><li>Yeah, when we, Gary and I had a chat in the office
 for a while worth while Sarah was preaching to the school,
 and we were talking a little bit about that,
 and he was just sort of encouraging me that,
 you know, we each have our part,
 and if we're all trying to do the other person's part,
 then there's parts that aren't done.
 And I was like, right, that makes sense.
 And he's like, just be free to operate how you operate,
 and God's gonna grow you in it,
 but don't feel like it has to look like how I do it.
 He said, he was talking about when he was ministering
 with David Wagner.
 And he's like, you know, David Wagner does the room.
 Like he finishes the room.
 And if he's there till two or three in the morning,
 he finishes the room, you know, he prophesies over everybody.
 And he said, so I decided I was gonna start doing that.
 And he said, and I made it like, I forgot what he said,
 but it was like, I made it like two hours and I was like,
 yeah, I'm done.
 I don't have the grace for that.
 And he's like, and I had to arrive at,
 I'm not David Wagner.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know, and we're all gifted in different ways
 and that's totally fine.
 So-- - And that's encouraging
 'cause I think I'm gifted in eating tacos
 and playing video games for Jesus.
  </li><li>You are, baby.
 You really are.
  </li><li>And if I stop doing that,
 who else is gonna pick up that mantle?
  </li><li>Yes, that would be tragic.
 It's true.
 Yeah, I just, I guess I feel,
 after spending the week with Gary and Sarah,
 just I feel filled up again and I feel encouraged to be me and probably push in more than I
 typically do.
 You know, like if I'm tired, I don't typically prophesy over people or whatever.
 Do you know what I mean?
 Like I, and instead of asking Lord, hey, do you want to say something?
 I just don't unless he invades my space, which he does sometimes, you know?
 So I just want to change some things, you know, with the Lord's help with how I, how
 I operate on a regular basis.
 I think the fun thing for me is obviously Gary was prophesying over a lot of people
 that we know because we pass to them. And it was just amazing to hear God's perspective on
 situations that we've prayed about for months and be reminded that God's resources are limitless,
 that we haven't exhausted God's potential, is what I'm trying to say. And it was just lovely to have
 a fresh perspective on circumstances and situations from somebody who didn't even know about them.
 Yeah. And it's fun to watch people you know and you love be loved on by God like that.
 Like you know that they're leaving encouraged and you know, and they know that God sees
 them, which you can tell them that all day long, but an experience like getting picked
 out or whatever that that changes it doesn't it. Because you now know, a God really does
 have Holy Spirit GPS on me.
 Right.
 Yeah, I loved it. I just love the whole week. It was so fun. I love to that Gary and Sarah,
 the same people at home as they are at the front of a meeting or whatever, which I mean,
 most of the people that we've had on the podcast or, you know, that we hang out with
 that. That could be said about them, but I just, I love that. I love the reality of
 who they are. So talk to me about seasons of hunger in your life and what it looked
 like for God to answer them.
 Well, I think it's funny because the hunger and the filling come in two
 different seasons.
 And I think especially in our lives today, we've forgotten that there's two
 different seasons because we're in a microwave culture where if I'm hungry,
 I can just go and get something to eat whenever I want.
 I don't really know what it's like to be hungry.
 Yeah.
 I can just, you know, graze all day or ovary.
 And I've really forgotten what it's like to be hungry.
 And I think spiritually when God deposits something in your heart for hunger, it's not to tease you.
 It's because he wants to, you know, get in serious, the reason God stretches you is to fit more of him in you.
 Yeah.
 And I love that.
 And it's funny that we're talking about hunger because this morning I was in church and I was thinking about
 many, many, many years ago when I lived in Edinburgh as a school teacher, had a very normal life.
 And it wouldn't be unusual for me to drive through to Glasgow.
 It's another city about an hour or so away from Edinburgh.
 to just to attend church on a Saturday night. There's a church and there is a church called Glasgow
 Elam and they used to do Saturday night revival nights and I would just drive through just to be
 in worship and just to be in the presence of God. It's funny I was thinking about this because I
 was drinking a large bottle of water this morning and I remember one time going through I'd been
 fasting because I really wanted God to break through and I had a large two-liter bottle of water
 and I didn't tell anybody I was fasting but my friend Andrew said, "Well, that's a sure sign
 of somebody who's fasting and he thought it was funny. I thought it was funny.
 But I remember being hungry for God and fasting for a touch. I remember, obviously, I kept
 going through to Glasgow, because I kept being touched by God. But how, like God, some 10,
 15 years later to fill me now, what I'm living in now is what I couldn't have imagined to
 be hungry for back then. What I was hungry for was a touch from God.
 Now I live in that permanent place of God's abundance.
 Like my norm is so beyond what I could have asked or imagined back then.
 Well, I think that's the thing of, you know, when kids ask you for a gift and they're like,
 hey, can I have this little thing over here?
 And you can sit down with them and go, well, you could.
 Have you thought about this and shown them all the other stuff?
 And then they're like, I had no idea that was available.
 You know?
 Yeah, I feel the same.
 I was thinking about, I remember being super, super hungry,
 when I went away to YWAM and really the first many years
 of the renewal just constantly being like,
 there's got to be more, there's got to be more, you know.
  </li><li>Really in the midst of renewal?
  </li><li>Yeah, because it made me hungry.
  </li><li>So hang on, let me get this straight.
 You're living in one of the greatest outpourings
 in the history of church.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And you're not feeling satisfied,
 you're thinking there must be more?
 No, I mean, not in an ungrateful way, but I was like,
 "Lord, if this is available, what else?
 Like, what's more?"
 You know, like, I had no idea this was available.
 So, gosh, there must be more.
 And I think the presence of God builds hunger in you.
  </li><li>Right. - You know?
 So the more time that you're spending
 in the presence of God, you know, for me,
 this sort of the hungry are God.
 And I don't think my mind ever arrived at doing what we're doing now,
 seeing the kind of stuff we see now.
 hearing God the way I do now.
 Like, I don't think I ever arrived at this as the thought.
 You know what I mean?
 Like I was sort of like, gosh,
 I'd really like to know that he talks and, you know,
 I don't know.
 And I'd love to do something in ministry.
 You know, it was just, so I don't know.
 I think hunger also makes room for God to grow vision.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 There comes a time in life
 where you have a holy dissatisfaction.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And it's a little bit like what you were saying.
 I remember being in a season like that where I was just saying, "God, I'm grateful for
 everything I have.
 I truly am."
 But the reason you surround yourself by people who are further in than you is to be provoked
 to jealousy, to have what they have.
 So I've been thinking a lot about the anointing.
 I've been thinking a lot about the anointing that rested on Jesus, for example, that he
 was anointed by God and went around to strong works of the enemy.
 And I was just thinking, Lord, to what degree am I walking in the
 anointing that's available for me?
 And so I've been, you know, I've been stirring up hunger thinking,
 Lord, actually, this is what I want.
 I wonder, and this isn't a fully baked thought, but I wonder if in the
 natural, you know, when you're hungry, you can persuade yourself that you're
 not hungry by eating Skittles and Doritos.
 And, you know, you're, you're pushing off hunger with frivolous, nonnutritious 
 things. I wonder if in life that there are things that are sweet and nice
 and everything but are not nutritious. Like video games? Certainly not video games,
 no, other things. No, but seriously, things that are fine, but are just actually stopping
 you experiencing the hunger that God's built you for. And again, God doesn't make you hungry
 to tease you. He doesn't hide himself from us. He hides himself for us, you know, to
 go looking and to discover a new facet of him. So that's hunger. I was just thinking
 for people who are who are hungry right now. Perhaps you're provoked to jealousy, even
 listening to some of the stories by the people we've had on the podcast. You know, that hunger
 is unto something and follow that hunger. That would be my encouragement for you because
 God causes hunger because he's a good daddy wants to satisfy you with rich things.
 And my testimony is somebody that God plucked from obscurity and satisfied me.
 I feel like the wealthiest man in the world.
 I feel so full of God's kindness towards me.
 And if you'll do it for me, he'll absolutely do it for you.
 Yeah.
 But the thing with hunger too, is that you have to feed hunger.
 Because eventually, if you just think in the natural, eventually, if you stop eating,
 Eventually your body stops asking for food and you die, but you can shrink your stomach
 down to no capacity whatsoever.
 So you don't even know you should be hungry.
 And it's the same thing spiritually.
 You need to feed hunger.
 One of our students, Tiffany Zias, posted this week on Facebook, something completely unsolicited
 from our point.
 But it fits in neatly with what we're talking with regard to hunger.
 She said, "Going to grace in our school of supernatural life has honestly been one of
 best decisions I've ever made. The school is designed to change your life and for me
 it's done just that. Before I saw a cell I was hurting, believing lies that had been
 spoken over me and weary of constantly striving for perfection, acceptance and value. In the
 past six months since starting the school I have experienced the presence of God like
 never before, come into a full realization of the Father's unconditional love for me,
 and are now walking in a new level of healing and identity in Christ. When I first heard
 about the school I thought, that sounds amazing. I would really love to do that, but I'm a mom
 and I stay at home with my kids and insert a bunch of other excuses here. But before I knew it,
 God provided for each of the needs those excuses stem from, and I'm forever grateful. Not only was
 Esso sell the best decision I could have made for myself, but it's all the best decision I could
 have made for my family. I cannot recommend this school enough, it will truly transform your life.
 I wish that everyone I know could experience this. If even just a small part of you are saying,
 Yes, I'd love to do that.
 But then you have reasons pop up of why you can't,
 such as distance or kids or resources, age or job, et cetera.
 I encourage you to bring it before God
 and see what he can do.
 And I love that story for a couple of reasons.
 One, of course, it's very complimentary
 but the school that we run in,
 two, it's great to hear positive feedback
 from our students.
 But third of all, I think it's interesting
 that she had a hunger and a desire for more of God.
 But was sad she couldn't meet that hunger on her own.
 But that's the point of hunger.
 induced by God is that he's saying the hunger itself is a doorway into something.
 Yeah, it makes you look for something, doesn't it?
 Yeah, our response is to head towards it and say, please Papa.
 Yeah, would you answer the hunger?
 So, I don't know how hungry you are. If you're not hungry, get hungry. If you are hungry,
 be filled.
 Stay hungry.
 Yeah, that's best piece of advice I've ever heard is get hungry, stay hungry.
 Yeah.
