<p> I live in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the chances.
 Do you want to tell everybody what MJ said as we put into bed tonight?
 Oh my gosh, it's so funny.<br/>
 So I'm putting him to bed and he's sleeping in our bed right now because he said he heard a loud noise upstairs.
 So every once in a while he'll fall asleep in our bed, then Alan carries him off and puts him in his.
 And so he says, "Mommy, what are you and daddy doing this bed?"
 I was like, "Ah, we sleep."<br/>
 He's like, "What else do you do?"<br/>
 Because sometimes it sounds like daddy is working and you're resting.
 [laughter]<br/>
 I was like, "What?"<br/>
 That is going to be the strangest word of knowledge a child could have.
 [laughter]<br/>
 Well, let's get this podcast done so I can do some work if you can rest.
 [laughter]<br/>
 Thanks, darling.<br/>
 I've been away all weekend. So you've been holding four with three children on your own.
 I have. Yep. How was it? It was good. It was good. They were awesome.
 They look like you had snow while I was away. We did for not very long.
 Right. So it's snowed in the morning, but we had already made plans to take the kids to this
 jumping place. And then when we came out, the snow was melting and MJ was not happy with me,
 because he apparently thinks I control the snow. Oh, pretty chicken.
 Well, I was away this weekend in St. Louis. All weekend for a men retreat with the men
 of Southgate Church. Thank you, gentlemen, for your hospitality and your warm welcome.
 I took a bunch of our guys from the school with us who they just absolutely killed it.
 One of my highlights, babe, on the way home is I stopped at a restaurant called Lambert's.
 Now, if you've never been to Lambert's, the only way I can describe it is if Cracker
 barrel got drunk and hooked up with a state fair and they had a baby. This is what Lambert's
 looks like. So John Reed is like, "Oh, would you tell you a Lambert's lunch?" I'm like, "Sure."
 And so we put a lid on him like, "Good Lord, what have you brought me to?" And it was packed.
 And so my hopes are not high. It really looks like what cracker barrel might have been modeled after.
 And so we sit down and all of a sudden, this guy's showing hot rolls and I notice hands go up all
 all over this room.<br/>
 And in rooms massive, the restaurant seats 500 people.
 And this server starts hurling bread rolls of people.
 (laughing)
</p><ul>
  <li>You're kidding.
  </li><li>No.
 Do people get hit in the head?
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>It's surreal. - Right, oh.
  </li><li>So you just put up your hand.
 And the guy's awesome.
 He just throws at your hand and you know, you--
  </li><li>Is that like his only job?
  </li><li>That's his only job.
 One's run hot rolls and then just throws them.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
  </li><li>You catch him now.
 That was endless fun.
 And the rolls were delicious.
 They were apps that apparently I didn't have any of this.
  </li><li>Ah hah.
  </li><li>Confession is good soul.
  </li><li>But then I ordered food, we all ordered food.
 And the food was fantastic.
 I was utterly repentant.
 I thought, oh my gosh, I'd come back here in a heartbeat.
  </li><li>Okay, so next time I go, I wanna go to Lambert's.
  </li><li>You wanna go Lambert's and you wanna be prepared
 for people throwing things at you.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Quite the experience. - Okay.
  </li><li>That had a great time.
 All right, recap the week.
 Wait, did I miss anything while I was away?
 No, everything's fine, there was snow.
 everything's fine. There is snow. We had lots of fun. We watched our family movie, which we watched
 sing. Is it good? It's cute. All right. I'll rewatch it with the girls. Yeah. And that's better. We just
 had lots of fun time. So they did great. Of course, none of nobody enjoyed this bringing forward
 this morning. No, well, I'm surprised that that was not a fun experience for anybody. Our son
 particularly needs his 12 hours. Yeah, I was not happy with that. So he this morning came halfway
 down the stairs and then announced I can't do it anymore.
 And I think he met the stairs.
 And so I went and grabbed him and I brought him down and he's like,
 "Mummy, I feel so emotional."
 That was his words.
 Yeah.
 And then I said, "Buddy, can I put you down at the table?"
 'Cause then I can get you some pancakes.
 And so I put him down at the table and he rested his head on the table
 until the pancakes got there.
 It was very sad.
 He is his father's son.
 Yes.
 Indeed.
 Highly emotional need food.
 Yeah.
 This week, we had a great week.
 David Wagner was with us at the school at Emmonay, a Grey Center.
 D-Wags.
 D-Wags in the house.
 If you haven't heard of David Wagner, you probably want to stop what you're doing right
 now and go download the David Wagner episode.
 It's episode 86.
 You can find that at <a href="mailto:allen@ag.com">allen@ag.com</a>/86.
 You need to hear this guy's testimony.
 It's unbelievable.
 David's a good friend of ours, a prophet, and you're always in for some amazing stories.
 So he was in ministering to our first year students.
 He was in ministering at Grace Center.
 I'll put a link in the show notes
 to the two services at Grace Center
 and he was ministering at M&amp;A really powerfully.
 So it was just great to see him, wasn't it?
  </li><li>So cool.
 Yeah, it was really, really good.
 All our students left an outreach.
  </li><li>Yeah, where are they?
  </li><li>They are in Iceland, South Africa, Romania, Georgia,
 and Nashville.
  </li><li>Guys, I want you to know that every morning,
 we wake up and we pray for you.
 and we're following all your adventures on Instagram.
 If you wanna follow along with them,
 look in the show notes, I'll put a link to the hashtags
 to follow them on Instagram.
  </li><li>And there's also a school blog.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, there's a school blog too,
 where you can see curated things
 if you want the kind of real time as it's happening,
 follow them all on Instagram.
 But super proud of you,
 students wherever you are in the world,
 ministering, representing Grace Center, we love you.
  </li><li>I actually met two people this morning
 from Lexington, Kentucky that came to Visigrae Center
 and they came up to say hi
 'cause they listened to our podcast.
  </li><li>Well, while I was away on the weekend,
 I met one of the guys,
 I bumped into a lot of people this weekend who said,
 oh, we listened to your podcast,
 which is always fun to hear.
 But one of them said,
 oh yeah, we made a trip down to Franklin
 to visit all our restaurants that you talked about.
  </li><li>You're kidding, that's so funny.
  </li><li>I really do need to put a visit Franklin page on our site
 so that people don't have to hunt through.
 Yeah, we get some free time, we'll do that.
 Yeah, that'll be in like when?
  </li><li>Oh, I think July.
  </li><li>Yeah, sure.
 Also babe, this morning while you were not there,
 we welcomed Raimi Wayland, who's our new children's pastor.
  </li><li>Come on Raimi, welcome to Grace and Wahoo.
  </li><li>So Raimi and Brian and their three kids
 moved here on Wednesday and they're getting settled
 and yeah, it's really exciting.
  </li><li>Yeah, we're so excited for these guys to be here
 and to spearhead our new children's ministry.
 We're super excited about that.
 All right, our main topic for this week.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>It's somewhat depressing.
 I'm trying to put a positive spin on it.
 You know, I'm a
 I wonder if there's a better word than backsliding.
 Backsliding is such good Christian ease, isn't it?
 Yeah.
 Um,
 falling away, reversing out of relationship with the Lord.
 I'm sorry.
 I need to start a new competition on a better word than backsliding.
 This this weekend, I thought it was funny.
 Somebody asked me over lunch or dinner.
 They said, Hey, it's pastoring hard.
 And I kind of chuckled because that really the pace of pastoring and the preparation, the planning, the preaching, you know, all that sort of stuff.
 That's fairly easy.
 Yeah.
 That's not difficult at all.
 It does get tiring in seasons for sure.
 But I think any job you go through busy seasons, you know, you've got to get stuff done.
 So that's not a problem.
 But when it comes to things being hard, I think easily the hardest thing that I've experienced is watching people I love fall away from.
 loving Jesus. Oh, by far. That is harder than doing funerals, harder than saying goodbye to loved ones.
 Yep. Watching people that we've been in relationship with say they no longer want to follow Jesus.
 Yeah. Yeah, it's super sad. So we thought we'd share the sadness on this podcast episode.
 Welcome. Yeah. Well, the thing is, I started thinking about it. And backsliding, it kind of
 comes in all shapes and sizes, doesn't it? I mean, there's a continuum, isn't there?
 In the same way, there's a continuum of being in love with Jesus. And I think there's varying
 degrees of it. But throughout my life, I've watched people who at one point have been absolutely
 devoted to Jesus. And then I've watched them make decisions that prioritize other things in Jesus
 and inevitably, unless there's interjection, unless that course gets corrected, their love
 love for Jesus ends up growing cold and they end up in various places, either disinterest
 or worse, absolutely denying Jesus. And I have such a hard time with that. And I realize
 I'm going to have such a hard time articulating this because it's something I've never experienced.
 And I'm trying to be sensitive to the whole issue because not that I think any backsliders
 going to be listened to a Christian podcast like this. It sounds like they, yeah.
 But if they are, I don't want them to feel anything negative for me.
 I'm just a loss for how it happened.
 So do you have any thoughts on any of the stuff?
 Well, I think the other thing that makes me sad that sort of is in that continuum is the whole
 thing of the people that would say, "Oh, no, my relationship with Jesus is fine."
 But if you were to look at their Instagram feed or their Facebook post, it's mostly about
 drinking or partying or, you know, whatever. And I'm thinking, well, okay. But what's your
 definition of fire? Yeah. And, you know, maybe you need to return to what it was before, you know,
 like it just, it makes me so sad. Because I'm like, if that's what you're willing to post,
 what else is happening that you're not posting? Right. You know what I mean? Like, and, and if
 you think that's fine, then actually you're not going to be teachable when the Lord's trying to
 get your attention.
 Right.
 And I think we've told stories in the past of people who've been in relationship with
 when we've gone to talk to them about, "Hey, they're life choices."
 And I remember one person saying, "No, I mean, Jesus are totally fine."
 And I might buy who standards.
 Right.
 I remember David Campbell, our friend saying he was confronting a friend who was making
 some really grave mistakes.
 Yes.
 And this is what this friend said.
 This friend was just like, "No, David, I'm good.
 I'm fine." And David said, "Well, by whose definition? Because the reason that we have
 the Bible is brilliant. God wrote down how he feels about being fine. So we don't actually
 have to go by our feelings. We can actually go by what's written in the Word of God."
 Right.
 And so the Word of God is there when we feel like it's right and the Word of God is there
 when we feel like it's wrong. So we have this like concrete benchmark.
 Right.
 And based on these passages, you're not fine. Right.
 And I was like, oh my gosh, that's genius.
 But I think part of the problem is I remember
 when I was in high school,
 I remember my senior year of high school,
 I had a really good friend, went to different high school.
 And I remember one day we'd been at skateboarding together
 and we were driving home and he looked at me
 and he just said, isn't being a Christian amazing?
 I said, it is.
 And he said, man, if I ever fall away from Jesus,
 would you please slap me?
 Now the thing is, you know, we went to different universities
 and we kept in touch, but I remember a couple of years later
 intersecting with him and his love for Jesus
 had gone absolutely cold.
 You know, he had no relationship with Jesus
 by his own admission, hand being on the church.
 And I was thinking, I don't even recognize you
 as the same person to have that conversation with.
 It's like I went looking for the friend
 who asked me to slap him and I didn't find him.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And that's what's weird.
 And the times that I've sat down with friends
 who have left their faith, who've backslid,
 and again, in varying degrees of digression
 away from Christianity, I don't recognize them.
 It's like it's a different person
 and with a different set of memories
 because when I start talking about the things before,
 they don't remember the things the way I remember them.
 And I'm like, dude, it was like a year ago.
 Like, I remember it really, really clearly.
 And then deception comes in
 and it becomes really hard to kind of break through that shell.
 That's if they'll even take my calls.
 I've got some people that I've, you know,
 when I reach out to won't want to hear from me,
 and that makes me sad.
 And, but I also understand that I probably represent,
 well, here's the thing I'm left guessing.
 I'm guessing that I represent everything
 they don't want to know about, but I don't know.
 So one of the things I was thinking of is if by chance
 you happen to be listening to this
 and you would feel that you were in the category
 of backsliding and you feel like I could benefit
 from your perspective.
 I would love to hear from you.
 If you can reach out to me via Twitter or via email,
 you know, anything like that.
 I would love to hear from you.
 Not, but I'm not gonna try and fight you or argue with you.
 I'm just fascinated how somebody goes from
 an intimate relationship with Jesus to, again,
 varying degrees of disconnect.
 to some people denying, and Paul says,
 they deny him by the way they live their lives.
  </li><li>Right, and that's the tricky bit,
 'cause I do know many people who would say,
 "Well, I still believe in him, I'm not denying him,"
 but the way that they're choosing to make decisions,
 the way they're choosing to live,
 would say something different, and that's what's sad.
 It's just like, "Oh, that can't be life for you."
  </li><li>Right, and I think absolutely as pastors,
 it is the hardest thing of watching that.
 And I want to be sensitive to the process
 and the journey that people are on,
 because I want to help people in the process.
  </li><li>So what do you think are some of the roots then
 of the departure, like?
  </li><li>That's a great question, babe.
 I don't know.
 I really don't know.
 And there probably aren't,
 there probably isn't a specific route.
 I would guess just from the conversations
 I have had with some people,
 or the conversations I've had with people
 who were away from the Lord and came back to him,
 and have been asking and, you know,
 journey with them.
 The reason I'm passionate about this topic, babe,
 is I feel like I'm called to reach Christians for Christ.
 I remember hearing Graham Cook say that.
 He said, you know, he doesn't feel like
 he's an evangelist necessarily.
 He feels like he's called to reach Christians for Christ.
 And I'm like, that's what I feel like.
 I feel like I want to reach and encourage Christians
 at all stages of their walk.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so, but back to your question, I...
 See, the thing is, here's some things on the top of my head, but the difficulties when
 I've tried to broach these topics with people who are talking to me, falling away, they
 don't like me bringing up these topics because it feels like, I mean, I don't know.
 I think we might be on the money with it and that's why it feels aoey to them, but who
 knows again.
 Right.
 Well, what if we look at it from a perspective of if you notice your heart going to any
 of these things just sort of be where because it might actually lead towards, you know,
 turning away from the Lord, which wouldn't be anybody's intention.
 Right. Oh, that's good. Okay.
 One of the chief things I've noticed in conversations I've had with people is a whole issue of offense.
 Yeah.
 It's very easy for our hearts to get offended either at people or churches. I mean, all
 you need to do is browse through some Facebook pages and you see people offended at church,
 offended at church leaders, offended at Christians, offended at people.
 And I remember Jeff teaching that amazing message, not being offended at God.
 Remember Jesus said, blessed is the person who's not offended at me.
 Yeah.
 And that's a big thing.
 Sure.
 If fence will rob you, it will totally rob you.
 And then it makes you think you're right.
 Right.
 But also offense.
 I mean, offense is real and probably maybe offense and hurt are the same thing.
 But I've also seen people hurt disappointed, let down genuinely hurt.
 And maybe we could put offended in that category.
 Yeah, I don't know.
 I think I think they're a little different.
 Like I don't think I've ever had the Lord say, you can choose whether you're going to be hurt or not.
 But I have had him say, hey, you get to choose right now if you're going to pick a fence.
 Her feels like something that's maybe a little bit more personal.
 You know, like a, I don't know, a little bit more direct or something.
 Well, offenses are always taken never given.
 Right.
 hurt can happen on an involuntary basis of fence is a voluntary basis.
 As in, I'm choosing to be offended. Yes. Yes. And while I can choose to be hurt,
 I can be hurt without, you know, I could just be an innocent bystander and be hurt.
 Yes. Yeah. And I think that always makes me sad. Like if, if for whatever reason, we don't have
 the either the tools or the track record of knowing what to do with hurt and how to navigate that
 and how to forgive and stuff like that, then it has a landing strip and it just builds a house.
 Well, think about the times that we've had healthy confrontation where maybe people we've been
 leading or people we've been pastoring have come and told us, "Hey, I've been hurt by these things
 that you've said." And it's so wonderful when they do that because you're like, "Oh my gosh,
 I am so sorry." That would have never, ever been my intent. And we get to walk through,
 How did we end up causing you pain?
 And we're going to dialogue with it.
 Was it insensitivity on our behalf?
 Was it pre-existing wounds in your own heart?
 They got re-triggered?
 Was it a bit of both?
 But it's fascinating having these conversations for people and realizing, oh,
 my gosh, this must be happening all the time.
 Right.
 But again, without proper tools, I see a lot of times people just
 recoiling, obviously, because they don't want to be continually subjected to pain.
 Yeah.
 I also think what's great about those conversations is it means we all get
 to grow, right?
 Like we get to grow because somebody's given us new
 information on how they're experiencing us.
 So we get to process that, talk to the Lord about that,
 ask them to help us with that, that kind of stuff.
 And whoever's actually bringing us that information,
 they get to grow too, 'cause they've just risked it.
 And you know, so I actually really like those conversations
 even if they're hard, 'cause at the end, it's like,
 oh, we actually, we can invite the Holy Spirit
 in to help us fix this.
 Well, here's the thing most of us are myself,
 and I presume yourself included,
 we are very typically unaware of how we're being experienced.
  </li><li>Sure, yeah.
  </li><li>Like at lunch today, I mean, the boys were,
 we were commenting on things we notice about one another,
 and we all had a good giggle 'cause we didn't know we did them.
  </li><li>Ever?
  </li><li>I had no idea I'd do that,
 and everyone was like, yeah, you totally do that.
  </li><li>What did they notice about you?
  </li><li>Apparently I have a, I have a,
 oh, noise when I'm showing sympathy.
  </li><li>You do, yeah.
 I mean, I didn't know that I did that.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>Yeah, one of our other team,
 we pointed out that when they're inquiring of something,
 they pitch shift their vocal up and octave,
 and they sound way more southern.
 And they were like, I do not do that,
 and the rest of us were just going,
 oh, you told me to do that.
 So, I mean, those are humorous examples,
 but I've had our students come and being very brave
 and just say, hey, you need to know
 that last week's interchange,
 this is how my heart fell when that happened.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And it's so amazing to be able to go,
 oh, I am so proud of you for being so brave.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I am so sorry, that was not the intent
 of my heart at all.
 And I'm gonna absolutely try and modify my behavior
 to preserve our connection.
 And I'm really sorry for the things I've done.
 And it's useful feedback for me.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Oh, that joke I just made, you don't find that funny.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Oh, I didn't realize that that was offending you.
 I can absolutely change my behavior.
 But if we don't have that experience or if we're in churches with unhealed leaders,
 I can see how people are ending up being hurt.
 Sure.
 But I can't think that the solution that Jesus had in mind was to disengage from the body.
 Here's a big Aoi.
 Okay.
 I'm ready.
 One of the things I've noticed, because, but let me backtrack for a second, because falling
 away is a deception, right?
 moving away from truth by very definition, its deception. One of the big open doors to being
 deceived is a refusal to submit to God's Word. Sure.
 Become super fashionable to move away from the Word of God as an authority in our lives.
 So when that happens, we end up following God on our terms, not his.
 And we begin prioritizing what's important to us over what's important to God.
 Right. What was the thing that David Campbell said last week or two weeks ago?
 I had this brilliant line. He said, if you don't believe the parts of the Bible that you don't like,
 but you do believe the parts of the Bible that you do like, you don't believe the Bible, you believe yourself.
 Right.
 And that's honestly where I see a lot of people. I remember speaking to a friend. She was a new believer.
 And she told me this in retrospect, which is, you know, I was a new believer and everything was going really well so far as a Christian, but I knew that as a new believer, I knew that Christians quote unquote had a perspective on gay and lesbian lifestyles.
 Right.
 And she said, I knew this because I've heard about it in the media, I've seen it on Twitter and, and she said I was smart enough to realize there isn't one view and I realized that what I've been hearing is a spectrum of.
 of people's views, but I knew that you had a view and I was interested to hear your teaching.
 And there was a sadness in her heart like, "Oh, how is my heart going to navigate this
 if you have a view that doesn't sound like a Christ-like view of this?"
 And it's not that she was saying she was going to disconnect or unplug, but I have seen
 some people disconnect or unplug.
 Yeah.
 Where you're like, "Oh, well, if that's God's view of homosexuals and I don't want to
 do with it. And my point isn't so much about homosexuality and God's view on that. My point
 is we have a standard and a view that's really important to us. And if we find that our churches
 or our peers or God himself doesn't hold to our standards, somewhere along the line we forget that
 we are the clay and he is the poder and we yield to him. And so I've seen that happen time and
 time again, like the classic example that I've used before is the guy that I confronted
 a number of years ago because he'd moved in with his girlfriend.
 Right.
 And I went to him and just said, "Hey, I heard a rumor that you guys have moved in together.
 Is that true?"
 I don't do gossip.
 I just thought it'd come straight to you and he's like, "Yeah, yeah, it's true."
 I said, "Well, you know what my conversation is going to be next.
 Like, what are you thinking?
 You guys are both committed Christians.
 This is a terrible witness.
 It is not wise.
 Are you guys sleeping together?
 Well, yeah.
 Okay.
 So now there's sin involved.
 Like you're not honoring God.
 Like nothing good is going to come from this relationship unless you're a pen.
 And so we had a bunch of conversations and a bunch of meetings.
 And but after several meetings, I went through the Bible with him.
 You remember the four of us sat down?
 I do.
 And at one point he just said to me, well, look, here's the thing.
 if Jesus Christ himself showed up, Alan, and told me that what I was doing was wrong,
 I wouldn't believe him. And I was like, Oh, so the issue isn't you're in sexual immorality.
 The issue is that you're not saved. And if you can't question my salvation, I was like,
 sure I can. You just said that you wouldn't submit to the man that you claim to follow.
 How can you be a follower of Christ if you're going to refuse to follow him?
 Now, that's an extreme example, but I've noticed that usually there's a breaking point for
 Christians and and
 I it's such a dangerous position when we exalt our own thinking over the word of God. Now,
 I am leaving huge amounts of room for people to explore different views of of scriptural
 interpretation and biblical exit. Jesus, I'm leaving huge amounts of room for that,
 But I'm saying if at some point we begin to have more trust in our ability to discern what God means
 then God has an ability to communicate what he means. That's the beginning of major deception.
 Right. And there is plenty of places where there's actually no gray area in Scripture
 for, you know, to say, well, I interpret it this way. Well, that requires a rewriting, not interpretation.
 babe what about the parable of the sewer like in thinking about reasons that people fall away
 right i'm just thinking you have immaturity you know people that are safe with joy but they have
 no root like there's no discipleship there's no maturity so when persecution comes or trouble
 comes they they fall away right that that is a an amazing parable because basically jesus is saying
 when it comes to christianity one in four people make it isn't that shocking it's heartbreaking
 It's totally heartbreaking. So in this case, he's saying there's people who get saved with joy.
 They receive the message at first. They're like, "Yeah, Christianity, I love Jesus. Jesus is my
 co-pilot. Jesus might be a f/f." And for a season, they're Instagram posts and they're Facebook posts
 for all about just God and majesty and amazing, but they never get discipleship. They never get
 connected to church. They never grow. There's never any mentoring. There's never any maturity.
 And then as Jesus said, when persecution or when trouble comes, they fall away, which is not the
 look we're going for this season. No, it's so not in. What were the other things that he said that
 the seed was on thorny ground, where the worries of life and the deceitfulness of wealth would grow
 up? Yeah. So what would you put that under wrong focus? So we're going along, we love Jesus, but
 but then another focus takes priority,
 whether that's our family or our career or money or--
  </li><li>Boyfriend, girlfriend, whatever, yeah.
  </li><li>And that's basically idolatry.
 We allow something to give us more comfort than God.
 The trouble is a lot of this stuff starts
 not necessarily with bad things.
 Like, it's not wrong to have questions
 about things you misunderstand in scripture.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Nothing wrong with that.
 Is that wrong to desire relationships
 or things or any of those things.
 I know that's wrong, but if it becomes our focus,
 if it becomes in place of Jesus,
 then we've got a problem.
  </li><li>Yeah, and I think partially something
 that concerns me recently or some messages
 that I've heard recently are things like,
 basically Jesus just wants you to have whatever it is
 that you wanna have and he wants you to be happy.
 And so just go after whatever it is that you want
 and that's what he wants you to have.
 And I think that's super dangerous.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Because again, it takes,
 then you're not focused on Jesus at all.
  </li><li>Right.
 I, again, don't know if this is true.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>But it's my observation.
 That when people are either offended or hurt or immature,
 or you know, when they've began to fall away,
 what happens is they tend to isolate themselves.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I've noticed that they usually start feeding themselves
 food from other people in the same camp.
 Right.
 So if they're disgruntled, they'll eat disgruntled podcasts and hang with disgruntled people
 who...
 Yeah.
 And I get that because there is comfort in knowing you're not the only person going through
 that.
 Right.
 But again, if those things are the expense of like, "Layer in Scripture talks about
 pure spiritual milk, then you're going to end up again. It's like the whole thing of birds of a
 feather flock together. If we're not careful, we end up finding resources to solidify our root cause,
 which is wounding or offense or whatever. And before we know it, we're justifying our
 our frustration at God.
  </li><li>Right.
 That's just super sad.
  </li><li>Well, yeah.
 I'm not even sure if I'm writing that assessment.
 That's my observation from the outside.
 And like I said, I'm trying to get
 a better understanding of that.
 And again, if you're listening to this
 and you've experienced what we're talking about,
 I would love to dialogue with you about that.
 I really would.
 If you go to alanagio.com/feedback,
 you can leave us feedback.
 You can send it anonymously if you want.
 I would just love to hear from people's experiences
 because my goal is to seek first to understand
 and then be understood.
 You know, recognize I'm on the outside looking in
 and I'm just trying to observe behavior
 that I'm witnessing.
 And so, you know, forgive me if I'm missing something,
 if I'm wrong on here.
  </li><li>Okay, babe, why don't we shift gears?
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And instead of talking about backsliding,
 why don't we talk about how do you sort of
 backslide proof your life. How do you make sure you don't head in that direction?
 All right. Well, I was reading. I don't know why I ended up. Actually, I was teaching this
 this morning. I was teaching something in first Peter. I wasn't teaching about backsliding,
 but I was teaching from a verse in first Peter and I was started reading it and I knew that
 we were going to be talking about backsliding tonight. So I read a little bit more on the
 journey home this afternoon. And I've got a couple of verses that are found in first
 Peter. Okay. Are you ready for them? I am. All right. So I'm going to read from first
 Peter chapter 1, verse 3, verses 13 to 15, and first Peter chapter 2, 1 to 3, up at all
 the references in the show notes.
 Again, I'm reading from the New Living Translation.
 He says, "All praise to God, it is by His great mercy that we've been born again because
 God raised Jesus Christ from the dead.
 So think clearly and exercise self-control.
 Look forward to the gracious salvation that will come to you when Jesus Christ is revealed
 to the world.
 So you must live as God's obedient children.
 Don't slip back into your old ways of living to satisfy your own desires.
 You didn't know any better then.
 But now you must be holy in everything you do, just as God who chose you is holy.
 So get rid of all evil behavior.
 Be done with all deceit, hypocrisy, jealousy, and all unkind speech.
 Like newborn babies, you must crave pure spiritual milk so that you will grow into a
 a full experience of salvation. Cry out for this nourishment now that you have had a taste
 of the Lord's kindness. There's a ton in there. What do you say? Don't slip back into your
 old ways of living. That's a nice phrase. Anyway, I don't think we can make that work
 like just across the board. We'll start calling it slipping back or back slipping or slip backing.
 A couple of things. Throw this out for free. Whenever you're reading the New Testament
 And you see verbs highlight them in your Bible because they're usually instructions of things to do or not do.
 Oh, that's great.
 Yeah.
 No, so I've highlighted some of them.
 I've got six things that we can do to prevent us from backsliding.
 You ready?
 Yeah, hit me.
 Well, he says a couple of times it will start by saying all praise to God.
 And then he says, look forward to salvation.
 And those things, that's basically cultivating worship in your life.
 It's so important to keep the main thing, the main thing.
 Right.
 So when we have a priority of worship of Jesus, everything else, our questions, our frustrations,
 our wounding becomes less important. Right. It's subject to, isn't it? Absolutely. You keep Jesus,
 and I think that gives us the proper perspective. Sure. Because the danger is when we're
 wounded, we dethrone Jesus and make our pain the most important thing.
 You don't want pain leading you in life. You want Jesus, the king king. So that's the first thing.
 worship. Number two, he says, because you're saved, think clearly. One of the reasons I see people slip away is that often people are getting carried away by strange doctrine.
 Yeah.
 So all the time, like, you know, often people say, Hey, you know, have you read this book or have you watched this YouTube clip? And like I watch a bit or read a bit.
 And I'm just like, no, you don't want to be watching that reading like, like these people are confused at best, deceived at worst.
 Right. And I get it. Like, I get it. If you've grown up in the church, there's a temptation that
 we can know more than we're living and then boredom settles in. What does a bill says? If
 you're bored, you might want to check the distance between you and the master. If your Christian
 experience has been reduced to an intellectual hobby, you are going to get bored and you're
 going to go looking for teaching that's going to tickle your ears, as it says in scripture.
 And you're going to spend time with empty philosophy and you're no longer going to be able to think
 clearly. Your thinking will be muddied. Are you ready for number three?
 Yes.
 All right. Number three, exercise self control. Now, we think self control is doing sit-ups
 in that seven minute workout app that we downloaded and try twice.
 Oh, okay.
 And then never did again.
 How is plank an exercise?
 It's not. It's definitely not. It's drafting in a very horrible position.
 There's no rest. It will be a next waterboard yourself.
 True. So the Greek words used in that phrase can literally be translated and in some versions,
 like the NSB or the NIV literally means be sober.
 Right. Here's the craziest thing. I can't believe I'm actually going to say this sentence next.
 Okay. Now I'm worried.
 But a big door to deception is drunkenness and getting high.
 Yeah.
 Now, why on earth would Christians be getting drunk and getting high?
 Well, I mean, sometimes I think it's probably because they've probably listened to somebody with
 faulty theology that's like, "Well, if that's what you like, God likes what you like."
 That kind of stuff.
 Right.
 And yeah, so you listen to bad teaching or you're hanging around people who are not doing
 well either and you're making foolish decisions.
 Together.
 And then, or if you've wrestled with abuse of alcohol or drugs in your past, of course,
 it's going to be an area you're going to be tempted in.
 Right.
 watching people be unable to manage what they drink or watching people who think it's okay
 to smoke weed as Christians is like watching somebody trip at the top of the stairs. You
 know what's going to happen next. They're just going to fall all the way down to the
 bottom. Like you are literally opening yourself up to demonic oppression. If you're not sober,
 you're outsourcing your consciousness to demonic spirits.
 Yeah, super dangerous.
 I thought we were turning around this to achieve your thing.
 Let's turn it around. What's number four?
 All right, number four.
 Yeah.
 He writes, "Don't slip back into your old ways of living."
 Well, that just covers a multitude of behaviors, doesn't it?
 Sure it does. Absolutely.
 It's anything that would have previously robbed life from you that you were saved from.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 And here's the great thing about New Testament living,
 is we don't need to provide you with a list of things you can and can't do.
 Right.
 That's what the Holy Spirit said.
 The Holy Spirit is so good at leading you into all truth.
 Yeah.
 So you walk with the Holy Spirit.
 You know, one of the biggest areas I slept back into?
 The big temptation for me is debate.
 Sure.
 Like, because my upbringing was one of, oh, I can now argue you.
 I will, I will absolutely take you to the man I'll argue you.
 And that's just what I grew up in.
 That was the culture I grew up in.
 Oh, you want to go toe to toe theology?
 Here we go.
 Right.
 So when I'm on Facebook, like, oh my, I just, I just have to turn it off because I'll see
 conversate and they're not conversations. I'll see
 flame war starting. And I'm thinking, oh, I could be the sheriff. I could just jump in and clean up
 this town. But nobody's on there because they want to learn something. They're on there because
 they want to vent. Right. Right. I totally agree. Yeah. And I think so far, I think that my history
 spoken for myself and I haven't engaged in any of those conversations.
 Yeah.
 But it's like a red flag to Bull.
 I just have to watch myself.
 Oh, same, babe.
 I've had to unfollow people, like just because typically the kind of stuff that they post,
 I know that they don't actually want truth.
 They just want to, you know, say stuff and I'm just like, Oh gosh, like I'm going to
 have a hard time not commenting or trying to straighten it out when I know you don't
 want to be straightened out.
 So here's what I've learned is we actually have a platform that we can strain things
 out.
 Like we can talk about it on our podcast and people, if they are interested, can listen
 to it.
 And but I'm not going to hijack somebody else's thread and get into a fight with random strangers.
 Yeah, there's no problem.
 Sometimes, you know, if I promise myself, I'm going to be good.
 Just and this is mean.
 I just kind of few what's happening.
 Like somebody I know will post something and it's not bad, you know, but I'm thinking,
 Oh, wait for the store.
 Let's get some popcorn.
 And then people that this person doesn't even know,
 but it's a cousin of somebody else who does know,
 jump saying and you're just like,
 "Oh my gosh, did you really write that out loud?"
 Right. I mean, calling and all kinds of stuff.
 And it just, you know,
 and what's crazy is these people are Christians.
 Yeah.
 Which leads me to number five.
 Be holy and get rid of all evil behavior.
 He goes on and says be done with deceit hypocrisy jealousy and all unkind speech.
 All unkind speech covers a lot.
 Imagine if you're an all unkind speech filter on Facebook.
 Yeah, that'd make Facebook so much better.
 All right. And then last thing, number six, it says crave and cry out for pure spiritual milk.
 Look at the language that's being used there.
 It's as far from passive as you could possibly get.
 Right. It's like pursue with all energy.
 Like there's a hunger there for a full salvation experience.
 Yeah.
 I'm not sure what's meant by that, but it sounds amazing.
 Yeah.
 So our encouragement to you is if you are backsliding and you are listening to this,
 thank you for listening to it.
 I don't know if we've pushed buttons or annoyed you intensely, forgive us if we have.
 If we've been ignorant or insensitive, we would love your feedback.
 We would genuinely love to know a better way of communicating to people who are
 further away from Jesus than they used to be, because our goal is to help reach Christians for Christ.
 If you're not backsliding, we don't want you to. These are some things we can actively be doing
 to prevent ourselves arriving in a situation that could start the downward descent into backsliding.
 Yeah. And again, I mean, going back to your original question, it's really the only thing I find
 difficult about pastoring is watching people derail their lives. Sometimes it's a really slow process
 where we're meeting with a number of times on their way down and they can't see their on their way down and by the time they're down there,
 they're just it's too much effort to come back up or something you know and it's so painful it's like i'm not even emotional person is but that's the stuff i cry about.
 I did that was supposed to be encouraging i hope it was just for double measure the encourages a tell something encouraging how about this Jesus is still on the throne yes.
 and he's way bigger than the devil.
 We're not fighting a losing battle or anything like that.
 And so it's it is all good.
 God is good.
 And there's also prayer going on.
 I met people this weekend who get up at three o'clock
 so that they can pray between four and five for the prodigals to come home.
 Oh, that's lovely.
 Well, it is lovely.
 But like one person I met, his name is Chris.
 He got up at three forty five that morning, prayed from four AM to five AM.
 and then ran from five a.m. to seven thirty a.m.
 Wow. I was feeling good about the fact that I'd go out bed and pull pants on.
 Well, I'm very proud of you darling. Well done for wearing pants.
 I did not feel like an overachiever that day, but my point is,
 you know, we're not in despair. We don't just throw up our hands and go, "Oh, no."
 But we can actually pray. Yeah. And just powerful. Yeah. All right.
 Well, hopefully that was helpful. I'm too tired to do any list of questions because I've told we can,
 and I've sat in a car for six hours and now I want to go to bed.
 I see you winking over there.
 Yeah, I know that was my subtle wing wing.
 Yeah, that was very subtle.
 All right, so in wrapping up, you can follow us on Instagram and Twitter at Allen and AJ
