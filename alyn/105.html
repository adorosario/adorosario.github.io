<p> I live in a j's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 I didn't.<br/>
 Joan.<br/>
 How are you my baby?<br/>
 I'm good.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 I am doing fantastic.<br/>
 Welcome to keeping up with the Joneses episode 105.
 Wow.<br/>
 Thanks.<br/>
 Thanks for welcoming me.<br/>
 Welcome right back to you.<br/>
 I sent you a feeling a little bit sassy this evening.
 I might be.<br/>
 I'm a little punchy.<br/>
 I'm very tired.<br/>
 It was a crazy week.<br/>
 So well, now to be fair, we say that every week, man, we've had a crazy week, man.
 It's been a busy week, but of any weeks that we've had this year, I would say this
 week is a little busy as a normal.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 It was a crazy week for those that missed it last week, we bought a house.
 We did.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 We put an offer on a house conditional on selling this one.
 And this week we sold this house.<br/>
 We had a whole bunch of amazing friends that came over and helped us declutter and get the
 house clean and ready to put on the market this week.
 And so we had people here Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
 It was like a SWAT team just swooped in.
 It's seriously.<br/>
 There was people packing.<br/>
 There was people cleaning.<br/>
 There was people like in baseboards.<br/>
 There was like four or five people here at almost all times.
 And worked tirelessly.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Amazing.<br/>
 Absolutely amazing.<br/>
 Thank you so much.<br/>
 Those of you that came.<br/>
 Oh, astonishing.<br/>
 Oh, amazing.<br/>
 And so I'm sure it was the first in the Bible about how two are better than one.
 Because if one falls in the pit, the other can get them out of the pit or something
 like that, I might be paraphrasing.<br/>
 It's true.<br/>
 And that one time when one of them fell in the pit, we were all able to get them out.
 So no, my point is, especially when I was loading and unloading stuff from the car.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Just having another person there instantly cut that in half.
 Yeah.<br/>
 and then scale up when you have five, six, seven, eight people.
 Oh, it was just amazing.<br/>
 Amazing.<br/>
 So the pictures were taken on Thursday?
 So, well, there was a couple of stages that we had to do.
 Yeah.<br/>
 We had to get the house ready to have photographs taken.
 Yes.<br/>
 And our realtor was like,<br/>
 you probably want to remove the vast majority
 of your furniture.<br/>
 And we're like, are you serious?<br/>
 But what are we going to sit on?<br/>
 What are each other going to play with?
 She's like, roll up your rugs and blind me.
 You could tell that she does that for a living.
 Yes.<br/>
 we did exactly what she told us to. Our house looked giant.
 Yeah, it looked much bigger. We're like, "Oh, you're such a smart cookie."
 You're clever.<br/>
 So we had to move a lot of our furniture out, a lot of our...
 What we thought was life, but it was turned out to be clutter.
 We moved out and we had to get that ready for Thursday when it started.
 It's not all clutter. I now have to figure out how to work without many of my kitchen
 gadgetry until we move. Oh, you'll be absolutely fine. There's plenty of kitchen gadgetry in the
 cupboards. Yeah. But yeah, so our mingle was get it ready to be documented in photographs.
 Yeah. And then the next stage was go another level deeper because we're going to have people
 coming to visit. Looking through your cupboards and stuff. So we were like, gosh, we need to actually
 clean, organize. Like we understand what's going on with our cupboards and we know where things are.
 but it doesn't look organized so we did that too.
 Well, it's like that when you tidy to have guests over.
 It's basically shove everything in that one cupboard that nobody looks in.
 Right.<br/>
 But then when you're selling a house and people are going to look through cupboards
 to see how much cupboard space you need to look in there and see what precious thing
 that you haven't been able to find for the last three months that's sitting in there.
 We still haven't found our car keys.<br/>
 By the way, if anybody stayed at our house and borrowed a garage door opener,
 could you check in your belongings to see if you still have it?
 Because we're down one garage door opener.
 and we need it back and we need to set up and the sand leaf keys.
 So if you borrowed our car as well, could you let us know that we perfect?
 Okay, thank you.<br/>
 Thanks so much.<br/>
 But anyway, so we had to tidy for Thursday.
 We had an open house on Sunday, but that didn't matter because on our first day on the market.
 Yep.<br/>
 Well, I got listed Friday afternoon, but our first full day on the market.
 We got an offer.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 And it was an amazing offer.<br/>
 It was.<br/>
 So we said, OK, yes, and we sold our house.
 It's gone.<br/>
 That was fast. So it's sort of the same thing on the front end. We saw that other house.
 Yeah, last week went and then decided, yes, we want it, put an offer in it.
 And, you know, I've been thinking all this week about, I was very Canadian of me.
 About. I've been thinking this week about the whole process of buying and selling a house.
 And I was thinking about how it's kind of like a microcosm of walking with God in life anyway.
 Okay.<br/>
 Here's what I mean by that is, let's start at the beginning and tell the story of how we
 started on this crazy process.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Do you want me to start and you'll interject like all my couples tell stories?
 Well, I think you're going to start with the stairs and my thought would start before that.
 Well, why don't you start before that?
 So I had been thinking since last summer that we needed to move, which was weird because
 We'd only moved in here two years before that, and it seemed very
 um, soon, but I just thought, Oh yeah, I, I don't know.
 Like I just really felt like it, but you were like, it's okay.
 You know, let's not whenever I was like, okay.
 I think I was going mad because, uh, how much work it is.
 How much work is right?<br/>
 Exactly.<br/>
 How much work is right?<br/>
 So I totally got that, but I still really felt like this was something we needed to do.
 But to be fair in our marriage, you're usually previous.
 Yes.<br/>
 Like by the time I think I've heard from the Lord, it's like old news to you.
 And you're very patient.<br/>
 And I'm not sure that you you never ever communicate.
 I felt like the Lord has said this.<br/>
 You just say, I feel this.<br/>
 And then by the time I hear from the Lord on it.
 Well, I just wait.<br/>
 Yeah, but why don't you just tell me pray?
 I think I felt the Lord said this because I think we both need to hear something
 because we're making a decision together.
 Well, that's true.<br/>
 Because even if you said the Lord told me this, I'd be like, oh, okay.
 Well, I'll wait for him to tell me.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Good point.<br/>
 Well, mate.<br/>
 So anyway, I had just sort of, I mean, not praying a lot, but every once in a while, I'd be like, okay, Lord, if we're supposed to move.
 Chat with Alan about it.<br/>
 So I was quite excited when this one day you walked upstairs and said, well, I want to be careful and tell him the story because what I've realized is that we often tell a story with one perspective.
 told we've lived out the end of it and then we changed the telling of the story.
 OK, so here's what happens about 11 p.m. at night.
 I'm going to bed.<br/>
 I'm climbing up the stairs of total Lexa to turn off all the house lights.
 And as I'm walking upstairs,<br/>
 Lexa is our electronic slave.<br/>
 Alexa, turn off the downstairs lights.
 I apologize to anybody who's listening this and you have an Amazon echo and it
 maybe just turned off all your lights.
 I apologize to that.<br/>
 So anyway, walking up the stairs is about 11 p.m. at night.
 And as I go upstairs, my, my own business, I thought passes through my head and it says this,
 now would be a good time to sell your house.
 And I wouldn't say it was a Lord.<br/>
 I wouldn't say it was me.<br/>
 The way I've described it is a little louder than my own thoughts and a little
 quieter than the way I normally hear the Lord.
 OK.<br/>
 But nevertheless, it had unusual content.
 It popped in out of nowhere.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 And I certainly wasn't wanting to move house, but I had been thinking of Jamie
 Galloway gave us a word. Last time he was here, he gave us a prophetic word about God giving us a
 house and it was coming out of left field. And I had been pondering, I had been talking with the
 Lord maybe in the previous couple of weeks about this whole thing of Lord, do we wait for you to
 move or can, will you respond to our faith or I was just mulling over anyway. And I got a bed
 and I wake up in the morning and I said, babe, I was going to bed last night and I heard this
 thought and that would be a good time to start your house. What do you think? And what did you think?
 Well, I said, why don't we talk to Bill?
 Okay.<br/>
 At this point, we need to introduce Bill Butler.
 Bill Butler, the man, the legend.<br/>
 The man, the myth, the legend.<br/>
 So Bill and Noni are very dear friends of ours who live in Franklin, Tennessee.
 We met them when we moved here to Gray Center.
 It's a long story.<br/>
 We really need to have Bill on the podcast.
 That'd be fun.<br/>
 I've asked them to come on, but I don't know whether I can persuade him to or not.
 Anyway, Bill is a very good friend of ours.
 He's he has got tons of wisdom and we often pick his brain about lots of stuff.
 He's yeah, he's got tons of experience, tons of wisdom.
 And for many people in our community, he's one of those people that people go to and say, Hey, you know, what do you think about this?
 What do you think about that?<br/>
 And so I just said, Bill, you know, this is what has gone up the stairs.
 I'm not sure it was the Lord.<br/>
 I'm not sure it was me.<br/>
 I just heard now would be good time to sell your house and he said, well, it would be a good time to sell a house.
 That's a great market.<br/>
 But usually people who want to sell their house know where they're going to first.
 And he encouraged me, just go push on some doors.
 Let's just just see how far that thought takes you.
 Yeah.<br/>
 So in an uncharacteristic fashion, it's what we did.
 Yes.<br/>
 I say uncharacteristic because the way we're both wired is we tend to like to have
 tons of research done and then make decisions out of analysis.
 Yes.<br/>
 Whereas this was, what can I hurt?<br/>
 We'll go and meet with somebody.<br/>
 Let's just explore it.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 So we went and spoke to a friend of bills.
 And we've quickly learned the bill knows everybody.
 And everybody's a friend of bill.<br/>
 He seems to know everyone.<br/>
 And so she sat down and ran some back of the envelope numbers for us
 and was like, yeah, yeah, you could.<br/>
 But you probably want to meet with a realtor just to see how much
 your house is worth.<br/>
 And again, I did some back of the paper calculations
 on how much I thought our house was worth.
 But I'm not trained realtor.<br/>
 I don't have a clue.<br/>
 So we kicked around some numbers and just thought,
 "Well, there's a couple of ways this could go."
 And invited a realtor over, and she was amazing,
 and she kind of confirmed our math a little bit.
 And so we thought, "Well, that's just, you know,
 it couldn't hurt to go out and look."<br/>
 So we went out and looked,<br/>
 and on the first day we looked,<br/>
 we found a house that had come on the market that day.
 First of all, day it was on the market.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And...
  </li><li>It has amazing potential.
  </li><li>It has amazing potential,
 but here's where the rubber hits the road.
 We've now gone from a theory in kicking tires to,
  </li><li>Oh my goodness.
  </li><li>What are we about to do?
  </li><li>We need to make a decision.
  </li><li>This could be insane.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>And so I sat down, first things first,
 to just be with the Lord.
 And just say, 'cause the way we went about it
 was uncharacteristic.
 Normally I don't move until I've heard the Lord.
 And I wasn't sure that now would be good time
 to say how it was the Lord.
 I wasn't even sure if it was my thought.
 And we were just kind of exploring.
 And so I sat down and just said, Lord, what do you think?
 And he was like, well, what do you think?
 And I was like, well, that's not a very helpful answer.
 And he's like, yeah, what I've learned about you, Alan, is you want specific answers to
 specific questions.
 And I'm like, yes.
 And he's like, but what I found is it doesn't actually help you.
 It doesn't bring any clarity to you because once you've heard my answer, you then want
 to know the how and the why and the when.
 And it's not wrong, but all your questioning does is lead you to more questions.
 And so the Lord pointed out, "Well, let's take off whether this is my will or not."
 And just let me ask you a couple of questions.
 I was like, "Okay, Lord."
 So he's like, "Haven't you enjoyed the process?
 Haven't you just enjoyed dreaming and exploring and having enjoyed browsing and pondering and
 wondering and having enjoyed the bubbling up of possibilities and having you loved all
 of this stuff. And I was like, actually, I have, yeah, I really love that. And so I just felt like
 the Lord for the, for one, not the first times in my life, but for one of the times in my life, I
 felt this joy exploring the landscape of possibilities without really considering whether this was right
 or wrong, whether this is what God has dreaming with God. Yeah, just kind of dreaming. I just felt
 the Lord said, actually, there's, as your dad, I'm happy to help you with whatever you would like
 to do. If you want to stay here, I'll make sure you're blessed here. If you'd like to move, I'll
 bless you in that too. But actually, it's important to me that you cultivate peace. And I'll give you,
 I'll give you the land that you choose to settle in and you'll have peace.
 Yeah.
 So I was strangely content with that answer. What did you think about that answer?
 Did that do anything in your heart or where was your heart in the whole process?
 I mean, my heart was excited or maybe excitedly cautious or cautiously excited or something.
 So I was sort of like, oh, I felt really peaceful about everything. And it felt like,
 okay, God, it feels like you're on this. And so I'm happy to keep walking forward until
 it feels like you're not, you know, right.
 You know, well soon there's a green light until you show us a red. Yeah, I think that was my comfort as well
 I called my dad and had a good hour conversation with my dad in Scotland and it was great conversation
 My dad is really prudent really wise
 Doesn't rush into things and I remember the last time we called him about buying this house
 I just thought you know my my dad will just give it to me straight
 and I was just really encouraged talking to my dad. I just got a verbally processed stuff and
 I just loved
 the
 the way we could just talk about things. And I said, that, you know, can you just listen to my
 thinking and poke holes in it? And he's a scientist. So he loves doing that. That's what he loves doing,
 collecting data and, and testing other people's theories. So I was like, Oh, I'm thinking about
 this. I'm thinking about this. And he's like, have you considered that? And I'm like, I have,
 and he's like, have you considered this? I was like, Oh, no, good. When I haven't. And it was
 just really good to have friends to bounce this off of. And we called our, our, our good friends,
 Josh and Ginger Hallmark who in my opinion know probably more about real estate than most people.
 And just ask them, like, is this why? Because here's what was happening. The whole time I'm enjoying
 this process with the Lord about exploring things and potential and dreaming. On the other side,
 I'm listening to another voice that sounds like reason but it's actually fear.
 and i realize that what's happening is all this fear that i'm going to be put to shame is going to pop up that somehow something's going to fall through.
 That i don't know maybe the loans are going to go through or there's going to be a problem or i'm going to be caught with my proverbial pants down where they're like oh and you need this you're like no we don't need this and this could be in large amount of money or.
 some paperwork or you don't qualify and having got my hopes up it was all going to come crashing down and the Holy Spirit was so kind he was like Alan,
 shame and fear are terrible counselors right and this is a bit I thought about the all this whole process is like walking with God in,
 in faith is that trusting is testing what do you mean,
 I don't mean pass or fail testing but more proving i remember and this probably the only thing i remember from high school chemistry.
 Are one of the things our teacher used to love to do in high school chemistry was do that thing were you show potassium and water.
 What happens when you show potassium and water doctor jones bubbles explosion explosion i don't suppose i've ever shoved potassium and water and that would be the day.
 the difference. Had I just had to read a book about the chemical reaction that happens when
 potassium interacts with two parts of hydrogen, one part of oxygen, probably just been lost
 in my mind palace. But what our chemistry teacher did was made us always safe to go.
 It's a drafty place that mind palace.
 No, but I'm serious. What I did was that he made us all our safety goggles and then with tongs
 dropped it in and ran away. And we remember the huge explosion. I remember actually some windows
 being broken. And in doing that, we proved that a chemical reaction took place.
 Right. Okay.
 Now, here's the thing with that proving is even if we didn't do the test, the fact still remains
 that potassium has a reaction when it comes into water. We didn't do the test because we
 questioned the nature of those two chemicals. He did it for us to reinforce our learning of
 the truth we supposedly already knew. Right.
 Are you still with me sort of but i'm wondering why when you take a potassium pellet and put it under your tongue you don't have an explosion in your mouth.
 I don't think it's a thing you think of magnesium.
 Oh yes.
 We should start podcast called science one one.
 Really let me tie together.
 Hey, so I'm thinking about with God that that God leads us into things or gives us the opportunity to walk with him that requires faith to prove himself so that we move from knowledge to knowing.
 Yeah, like from a tacit nod to a living experience, right?
 I think and I'm just sidebar here.
 I think that's why tithing is so awesome.
 Yeah, because everybody believes that God is good and that he's our provider and that he's going to take care of us.
 But he actually asks us to test that theory.
 And I think there's a grave danger that we would go through life merely acquainted with
 stories about God rather than with our own living testimonies of his nature.
 And I felt like this whole experience of risking, of being put to shame or the fear or like
 at one point, I just heard this, me, me, me, me, me.
 You know, the noise that big trucks make when they're backing up.
 And the Lord was like, Alan, you're backing up trucks of borrowed trouble.
 Like, you're sitting here and you're like, "You put Lord, what if this doesn't work?
 What if this doesn't work?"
 And the Lord was like, Alan, why have you dipped your ladle in the pool of worry?
 As Gary Morgan says, worry is a misuse of imagination.
 Yeah.
 like, why don't you apply that same mental energy to faith about how awesome it could
 be?
 Right.
 So once I kind of spent the morning with the Lord realizing, okay, I think that you're
 good with this.
 I think I'm wrestling with like, Oh God, I hope this all works out.
 What if we're, you know, what if we're idiots?
 What if we're making a financial mistake here?
 What if we're going to all this effort and we can't sell our house?
 What if?
 What if?
 What if?
 "Gosh Lord, how much of that do I do in my normal everyday life?"
 So I hope those of you who are not in the process of buying a house right now
 or getting something from this.
 My point is in life, everything that you're going to do with God requires trust.
 And whenever you step out in trust, there's a whole blanket of thoughts
 that will attack that thought.
 Don't listen to them.
 They're negative monsters.
 Yeah.
 Strangle them at birth.
 Meanwhile, I wasn't struggling with any of those thoughts, particularly.
 I was just cruising Pinterest.
 and looking for new home ideas.
  </li><li>So tell me, why did you not have any of this?
 Why did I have all that fear and anxiety?
  </li><li>I mean, I had moments of like,
 because it's quite a large house that we bought
 and I mean, granted, it's a great deal,
 but it's still like there was part of me that was like,
 but we're pastors.
 You know, should we have a large house?
 And then I'm like, wait a minute, I don't believe that.
 I don't believe that anywhere.
 right but that's shame coming out yeah so i just sort of but i was able to recognize it as soon as i started thinking and i thought yeah i'm actually not a partner with that at all in fact i'm gonna troll Pinterest for a decorating idea so you moved in the opposite spirit yeah.
 The other thing we should probably clarify because based on instagram and facebook feeds we should clarify that we are staying in franklin i'm like a lot of people are like where are you moving to an i like six minutes from here i want to start the pond so.
 say, East Nashville, California, Paris, but no, we're staying in Frankly.
 We're staying in Frankly.
 We're not moving.
 We're not leaving.
 Staying at Grey Centre.
 Yeah.
 And we're very excited.
 We're just.
 And we're thrilled.
 Moving to a place with a little more space.
 Yeah.
 And a pool and a pool, a pool in the neighbourhood, not pool in our house.
 Right.
 Well, which is better because I don't have to take care of it or get leaves out of it,
 but you can go to the pool whenever you want.
 Perfect.
 It is funny that we can be embarrassed by the goodness of God on our life.
 Yeah.
 Like you feel like you need to apologize.
 Right.
 So I very quickly pointed out that it's not a pill at our house.
 It's just a pill in our neighborhood.
 Like, so what's that?
 Maybe the Lord's going to war on shame in my life.
 That'd be a good thing.
 Oh, thanks.
 You noticed.
 Well, it's always a good thing if God goes to organs, things that are against him.
 So my question, dear listener, is are there facets of God's nature?
 that you're merely acquainted with and could it be in this season that the Lord is wanting to give you living tangible experience of that side of his nature?
 Because you discover more about God by walking with God, not by reading about it, and that sounds like it's terrible. Of course you learn.
 I love what John remember you to say that reading the Bible is the Bible is the menu.
 It's not the meal reading the Bible tells you what's available in your relationship with
 God.
 Don't confuse Bible stories with your relationship with God.
 They just want to the experiences we should be having with them.
 Yeah, it's really good.
 I would probably add to that this helpful tip.
 Um, don't put potassium under your job.
 Sorry.
 It's been a long week.
 Ladies and gentlemen, wait, why don't bananas explode when you put them in water?
 I think the level of potassium versus like a bath salt size portion of potassium.
 I'll put a link in a YouTube video to what happens when potassium hits water.
 Okay.
 And you'll see.
 I think you're right.
 I was taking magnesium perhaps.
 you were. And you were also taking homeopathic levels of magnesium, which means there's trace
 amounts. So that would also explain that. Okay. Or potassium, magnesium. Well, magnesium
 explodes when you're buying it. Let's move on. Okay. Do you want to talk about what we learned
 from Danny Sill class week and how we applied it this week? Can you speak specifically about
 what you're talking about? The whole connection thing, staying connected. Okay. Yeah. In previous
 moves. We've both gotten really stressed and the stress overtakes the joy of what you're
 trying to accomplish or the blessing that's hiding behind it.
 Right, because you become a monster.
 Right, and you're just task-oriented and then everybody is&acirc;€”everything is an obstacle.
 Correct.
 And we&acirc;€”both of our life languages, when we're in distress, tend to sabotage our relationships
 in fairly predictable ways.
 Right, we just tend to become fairly controlling and bossy.
 All right, yes, we both become fairly controlling.
 And so then we snip at each other and we end up becoming the people we don't want to
 be.
 Yeah.
 But we excuse it because we're busy getting the, I'm trying to do all this stuff.
 Right.
 So this week we did a much better job of prioritizing connection.
 Well we just asked a lawyer, we're like, Lord, it would be, it's like that verse that says,
 what does a profit man, if he gains the whole world?
 Like what is it profit as if we get a new house, but we hate each other getting there?
 right if we spent you know the next month or so packing up each other's throats right
 but it's all going to be good because we're moving to a different house like that's just
 dumb yeah so several times in the week we would pause and just say I'm just checking
 in with you I want to prioritize connection over moving yeah and checking with the kids
 too and making sure that they're doing well and stuff I did wonders yeah it was really
 good. No stress, no fights, nothing. We are wonderful, really, agent. She said, either
 bake bread or bake cookies before an open house or before showing.
 I don't think she said that. I think the internet told us that.
 I thought she told us.
 No, I think everybody's found out we're selling house and told us, oh, this is what you should
 do.
 Okay. Well, somebody told us. And so we, oh, we went and got some sugar cookies just for
 the smell because we don't eat those because they have gluten in them.
 So I was baking cookies and then throwing them in the trash just for the smell.
 But we did it.
 We baked cookies for the smell and then you walked around with the cookie sheet
 and wafted the cookie smell in every room before we threw them in the trash.
 Well, the thing is I feel terrible.
 We're just throwing away food, but I think they're possibly the worst cookies on the
 planet.
 I mean, they were like just flour and water and sugar.
 They were nasty though.
 They were just like, "No, of course it didn't,
 but I was just looking at the ingredient list
 and the cost of what I paid for them."
 I was like, "It was cheaper than dog food."
 As a rule of thumb,
 don't eat anything that costs less than dog food.
  </li><li>Good tip, good tip.
  </li><li>But the ones that just come straight out of the freezer,
 you put them in and 10 minutes later,
 they've transformed the fied into a cookie.
  </li><li>Yeah, terrifying.
  </li><li>Dear Lord, they smell so good.
  </li><li>Yeah, they did smell really good.
  </li><li>I'm pretty sure that the incense,
 the prayers of the saints smell like vanilla cookies.
 I hope not anything is malacred, but you know, whatever.
 So yeah, we had fun sort of getting everything ready.
 I'm super thankful that we don't have to keep the house
 at the level of cleanliness that it needs to be
 for people to walk through because with three kids,
 that was gonna become tedious.
 And I know lots of people that have showed their house
 for two or three weeks or even months.
 So for us, it just, it just, it felt so lovely.
 Like, oh God, even that's a gift that it was the first day,
 the first showing somebody walks through and says,
 I want your house.
  </li><li>You know what I forgot to mention?
  </li><li>What?
  </li><li>When the Lord pointed out that fear and shame
 were terrible counselors, he gave me Psalm 37.
 And so I just went and read Psalm 37.
 And there was a whole lot of stuff in there that was,
 I mean, it wasn't about a moving house
 because that's not what the context of the Sam was,
 but there's a lot of stuff in there that applied,
 but I wanna read portions of Psalm 37
 to anybody who's going through anything right now
 where you're needing to trust God.
 'Cause it was a huge incursion to me,
 the day that I read that, I was like,
 man, I'm on top of the world.
 So I wanna read a little bit of Psalm 37 over our listeners
 and then we got a listeners question.
 Boop, boop.
 Okay.
 I'm just going through all the bits I underlined.
 Okay.
 Psalm 37 verse three, trust in the Lord and do good.
 then you will live safely in the land and prosper.
 That's a nice encouraging verse.
 "Take delight in the Lord,
 "and He will give you your heart's desires.
 "Commit everything you do to the Lord,
 "trust Him, and He will help you."
 That was a fun thing.
 Starting out on a big project that we didn't know
 what we're doing.
 I'm just like, "All right, Lord, I'm committing this to you.
 "Would you help us, please?
 "Be still in the presence of the Lord
 "and wait patiently for Him to act."
 That's fun when you're waiting for contracts
 to come back and they're taking longer than you might like.
 the lowly will possess the land and will live in peace and prosperity.
 Day by day the Lord takes care of the innocent and they will receive an inheritance that lasts forever.
 They will not be disgraced in hard times, even in famine they will have more than enough.
 Put your hope in the Lord, travel steadily along his path, he will honor you by giving you the land.
 So I want to encourage you, no matter what path you're walking along today,
 No matter what journey you're on with the Lord right now, put your hope in the Lord and he will honor you by giving you the land or giving you the destination that you're walking towards.
 Age and I want to pray for you today that you would receive encouragement to reach the destination of the path that you're on.
 All right listeners question time go for it.
 It says when it comes to inner healing what things are my responsibility and what things are God's responsibility.
 That's a great question.
 Fantastic question.
 And not to talk about houses, but I have a house perspective.
 Oh, go for it.
 Well, I was thinking about when it comes to selling houses, what things are
 my responsibility and what things are God's responsibility, because in terms of our
 responsibility, we spent three days with a team of crack commanders cleaning our
 house, making it look presentable.
 and we put in a lot of effort.
 Sure.
 That effort doesn't guarantee anything.
 There's lots of houses on the market.
 Maybe nobody comes to our open house.
 There's lots of houses on the market, even in our neighborhood.
 Right.
 And so you could do all that work and maybe nobody shows up or nobody likes your house or
 and you can think, oh, that all that work was in vain.
 Right.
 Or we've heard testimonies of, you know, people just sitting at home, not even trying to sell our house
 and I knock at the door.
 We have a friend who this happened and somebody walked in and said, oh, I'd
 I love your house, can I buy it?
 And they had bag of cash and they bought the house.
 That was all the Lord, they didn't do anything for us.
 So, but what I learned is there's,
 there is this partnership,
 whereas you do what you can do
 and everything that God needs to do,
 you just step back and let him do that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I think that's similar with inner healing,
 but sorry to talk about houses.
 AJ, what do you think?
  </li><li>Well, I was thinking about in Psalm 139 where it says,
 "Search me, oh God, and know my heart.
 test me and know my anxious thoughts,
 point out anything in me that offends you
 and lead me along the path of everlasting life.
 I think there's something to be said for checking in
 with God on a regular basis and just saying,
 "Lord, search me and know me.
 "Like, know if I have anxious thoughts,
 "know if there's stuff that's going on in me."
 And then actually owning those things
 when God talks to you about them
 and not running from him
 and not choosing to go around the mountain 48 times
 before you deal with it.
 But actually saying, okay, Lord, you've brought this up
 and I trust in your goodness and I trust in your kindness.
 And so can we look at this together?
 And what do I need to do here?
 And then you just sort of do, like Christine says,
 do kingdom business, release forgiveness
 where forgiveness needs to be released
 and unhook yourself from ungodly beliefs
 and work through this stuff that needs to be worked through
 But I think it's both and I think God does some of it
 and you do some of it,
 but I think he's looking for us to start.
 When he brings it up, he's looking for our reaction.
 Are we gonna react or are we gonna respond?
  </li><li>Right, I think that's such a good point, babe.
 And I think everything in the Christian life,
 there's a couple of different camps,
 like there's one camp that thinks,
 "Oh, you don't need any inner healing."
 It was all done at the cross.
 And I'm like, just a quick look at your life
 and my life right now would tell me
 that that's not true. Like there are plenty of times where my behavior or my actions,
 my words, my thoughts are not in line with what Christ did on the cross.
 Right. Well, you have to appropriate it into every area of your life.
 And then there's another camp where it's all about naval gazing and it's all about, you know,
 what was me and I'm just a worm. And as with everything, there's a happy medium there of the
 sovereignty of God and the process of God. So all through scripture, we're told to partner
 with what he's done, like to be transformed by the renewing of our mind or to put off
 the old man and put on the new, to work out your faith with fear and trembling. There's
 just so many of those things.
 And there's action and all of those things that's intentional action on our part.
 But I think being teachable, I think listening to the Holy Spirit when he's like, Hey, I'd
 I'd love to help you with that.
 Yeah.
 Hey, could I put my finger on this or worse?
 When God speaks through people, your friends, your family, random strangers who come up and say,
 Hey, I noticed that you're a little sarcastic or, Hey, I don't know if you've noticed, but
 you're leaving a trail of destruction.
 Like it is so hard to receive negative feedback.
 Yeah.
 That God is giving you to bring you to a place of breakthrough.
 But if we will just be humble and listen and weigh in coming data and actually allow the Lord to do that,
 to point out to us and be willing to yield to the process, incredible stuff happens.
 Yeah, for sure.
 I remember when we went for our RTF, I remember about halfway through the week.
 This is a healing week where H&amp;I went away for a week and you sit down with two counselors and they
 they pray through a whole bunch of exhaustive stuff for you.
 And I remember about halfway through the week, I was just mentally, emotionally and physically
 spent. I think I'd cried for three days straight. And I was like, it's not that I didn't want
 to go back. It's just that I physically didn't want to go out of bed and go in there and cry more.
 And the Holy Spirit said, Alan, if you would just physically move your body into that room
 and just be willing to do the prayers they ask you pray, honestly, I'll do the rest of it.
 And that was really encouraging. I was like, all right, I'll show up. I have another verse for you.
 Yeah.
 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, verse 23 says this, "Now may the God of peace himself sanctify
 you completely, and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at
 the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, he who calls you is faithful, who will also do it."
 I think sometimes in our healing feel like this exhaustive, never-ending weeding in the
 the garden of our soul. But it's not. It's this super simple process where we have a dad
 who loves us and wants to refine us and help us grow. And we're just, but the Holy Spirit's
 help just love to point out any areas that we're living way below who we're built to
 be. And when you look at it like that, and when you realize it's not your job to fix
 you, it's just your job to say yes to God. Yeah. Like everything in life, things get
 remarkably simpler. Yeah, much better. All right, let's wrap up this bad boy.
 Well, we're going to Iceland this week, which is super exciting. Very exciting.
 We have been back in a few years, and so we're super stoked to go, but it also means we are not
 going to have a podcast next week because we will still be in Iceland. But come back the following
 week and we'll have a whole lot of stories about our time in Iceland and regular scheduled program
