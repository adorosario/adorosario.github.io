<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Welcome to episode 288 of Keeping Up With Joneses.
  </li><li>And it's 2023!
  </li><li>It's our first episode of 2023.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>We typically start with a weekly catch up,
 which is a bit of a misnomer in this sense.
  </li><li>Yeah, in this setting.
  </li><li>Yeah, given we haven't podcasts since November.
  </li><li>80 Jones fill the people in
 on what we've done since we last taught.
  </li><li>So we, well, for November and December,
 really we just rested hardcore
 and just had fun and decompressed.
  </li><li>Define resting hardcore.
  </li><li>Well, for me, it was a lot of reading
 and I've started painting again.
 So I did a lot of painting and just, yeah,
 trying to be creative, which felt good for my heart.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I played lots of video games.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I didn't play lots of video games.
 I played two video games a lot.
  </li><li>Yeah, like you 100% of two massive video games.
  </li><li>Yeah, I did.
 And I feel very proud of that.
 Scripps, I was having a lunch with a friend today
 and we're talking about that verse.
 And Hebrews says, "See too that you labor to enter his rest."
  </li><li>Uh huh.
  </li><li>It takes hard work to get into rest.
  </li><li>And Devits, I was wondering.
  </li><li>No, it sounded like it was like,
  </li><li>Yeah, super hard work to paint all day and video at it.
 But I think both of us really wanted to fast forward
 through the process so we could work out
 what we're doing with our life.
  </li><li>Yes, it did feel like it was making a conscious choice
 each day.
 No, we decided we were going to rest.
  </li><li>Stay in rest.
  </li><li>To stay in rest and not try to switch to planning.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, so we stayed in rest.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>We made Christmas.
  </li><li>We had Christmas, it was super chill.
 I think it's the first, well, other than the one thing
 that you just made the face about.
 Yes, we had a, we, age ahead of decision.
 Wow, I love how this is going so far, go ahead.
 Did you or did you not come up with the genius idea
 that we're gonna completely redo our daughter's birthday
 for her Christmas?
 No, that's not even English.
 Why don't you tell us?
 I didn't come up with the idea
 that we're gonna redo her birthday for her Christmas.
 Oh, what did I say?
 I mean, that's what you said.
 Swirl birthday for bedroom.
  </li><li>Yes, I did after,
 'cause Tia had been coming down and painting with me
 downstairs and she had made a comment about how
 she hated pink and I was like, you hate pink,
 but your bedroom's pink.
 She was like, I hate my bedroom.
 And I was like, what?
 On the inside.
 'Cause I knew she didn't choose those colors.
 Those were from when they were much younger and whatever,
 but I didn't know she hated it.
  </li><li>No idea.
 And she is, I would say she's probably our highest
 contemplator in terms of she gets real stuck on like,
 when you're like, what would you like for Christmas?
 What would you like for your birthday?
 She just doesn't know.
  </li><li>Right, contemplate of being someone who likes
 to think deeply about the decisions they're gonna make.
  </li><li>Yeah, and she doesn't, yeah.
 So she just gets kind of stuck.
 And so when we were talking to him about Christmas,
 she was like, I don't know.
 And she just knew she wanted some books
 'cause that's pretty much all she does is read.
 And so I came up with the genius idea
 of redoing her bedroom for her Christmas present.
  </li><li>And the slight problem with the genius idea was what?
  </li><li>Well, there was a couple problems.
  </li><li>Oh, I hadn't noticed.
  </li><li>Oh, shut up.
 So, painted the room, which went great.
 So it's now one less room in our house
 that is still builder's beige, my hated color.
  </li><li>Can I take over and speed up the process?
  </li><li>Yes, go ahead.
  </li><li>Also, we had some slight,
 I mean, I don't really want to go into it
  </li><li>This is such a long audio story.
 The point is it took us,
 when you said it was like a laid back,
 wasn't laid back,
 we were out trying to find furniture on Christmas Eve
 so that the child would actually have a present open.
  </li><li>Well, the morning of Christmas Eve.
  </li><li>Oh, yeah, we had the whole afternoon of our life.
  </li><li>Basically, the chair that I bought
 that we planned to hang from the ceiling
 where there was no choice to hang it from,
 so that didn't work.
 And I had bought wallpaper,
 and I guess you should buy expensive wallpaper
 if you're gonna buy wallpaper.
 Anyway, Amazon failed me and it didn't line up.
 So...
  </li><li>The point was all I wanted to contest
 was that it was a relaxing Christmas.
 I just remember the week before Christmas
 being fraught with tension
 as we were trying to get this thing done
 which kind of took us away from Christmas television.
  </li><li>And I wouldn't say it was the whole week.
 I would say there was like two or three days where like,
 huh, how are we gonna do this?
 As opposed to like...
  </li><li>The two or three days, which Christmas was on a Sunday.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So the two or three days was the Monday,
 Tuesday the Wednesday the Thursday Friday so I didn't even start painting it until the Wednesday
 and we didn't know anything was wrong at that point so I would contest that it was three days
 I'll grant you that okay yeah I preempted that the stress was becoming so Monday and Tuesday
 I was like are you guys there painting it I'm like I'm waiting for the chair to arrive so I can
 match paint to the anyway yes so but in the end we had a nice quiet Christmas well and we got to
 do her room and she loves it, which was the scary bit of the whole thing.
 In case you didn't like it, but she loved it.
 But she loved it.
 First year in a long time that we haven't had anybody for Christmas.
 Yeah, the first year in like six or seven, we almost always have extra people.
 Yep.
 And so...
 New years was quiet.
 I think we were in bed by like 9.30, 10 p.m.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I think we're...
 You know, that's what old people do, isn't it?
 Yeah.
 And then we purposed to start the year off
 to seek the Lord. But what we're going to do for those of you just joining, we are in a,
 you probably saw the title of this episode, which is all about how we make major life decisions.
 We are in the season where we're making major life decisions. And we didn't want to make those
 decisions out of reaction, reflex, need, urgency, which is why we rest it for November or even what
 we could do or what we thought up in our own heads or whatever. We want to seek the Lord. So I was
 excited like the part of my brain that loves to plan was finding it difficult the last
 I don't know week or so of December because I was knowing that like come January we're
 going to I was busy cutting down my caffeine intake so you know that was that was my focus.
 So January 1st you know we were going to see the Lord for the first 10 days and then you
 had some really bad tragic sadness do you want to touch on that briefly?
  </li><li>Yeah, on the sixth, I guess it was, or the seventh,
 I think it was the sixth.
 My mom phoned and said that my brother had been
 rushed to hospital in an ambulance
 and that he wasn't breathing.
 And all I knew was that my nephew had done CPR
 and we had no idea what was going on.
 And so we booked flights and,
 Well, we, I mean, you did, I was having a hard time
 keeping it together and you were just like the boss.
 So you got me, that's right, you got me flights
 and rented a car and Airbnb and headed up to Toronto.
  </li><li>So you flew up to be with your family?
  </li><li>Yeah, sure enough they had, he was in the ICU
 on life support and ended up,
 like they tested him as their bring him into ICU.
 they had COVID and what they discovered is that he had COVID and something called RSV,
 which is often little kids get RSV.
 I don't know how often it happens in adults, but the doctor explained that those two viruses
 together so overwhelmed his lungs and his heart that they just stopped.
 So they kept him sedated for 72 hours to try and let his body heal and see then afterwards,
 you know, is there any brain activity?
 Is there, they just sort of do this standard thing and they did all the tests and just
 said that he wasn't going to come back from this.
 And so on Wednesday, we met as a family.
 His boys really felt, you know, he would just want to go.
 And so on Thursday, we shut off life support, which was horrible.
 Oh, yeah.
 I can imagine the first two days, you know, we would suit up in these, you know, because
 it's COVID, right?
 And so you have hazmat suits.
 Yeah, basically, you know, gloves and the whole bit took like five minutes to get suited
 up in this stuff to go in.
 But the first two days that I went in and I just, you know, I prayed for him and you
 reminded him who he belongs to because many years ago he gave his life to the Lord and those first two
 days his eyebrows would move a bit and his left eye was you know tearing when I would you know pray
 for him and read scripture over him and played one of my new favorite songs over him and that kind
 of stuff. The next two days there was no response and it really felt like the first two days
 I felt like he was still there for lack of a better term. I don't have to explain it.
 And then it really felt like he wasn't. Yeah, I remember you saying you could feel a shift
 those two days. I think one of the things that you were most commenting on, the thing that struck
 you was your gratitude to John and Carol or being part of a church that did an altar call every
 Sunday. Every Sunday, every service, never mind even every Sunday. Like, I remember when we trained
 to MC the night services. It was if the speaker doesn't do an altar call, the MC doesn't you always
 do an altar call. And I was super thankful for that. Because he got saved. Because that's how he got
 saved. I remember the day that he walked because he walked past me and I just dropped to my knees
 and started bawling and John led him to the Lord. And even when I was getting ready to fly down
 and I just sent out text messages to some people and asked them to pray. And John phoned right away
 and just said, "Now, is this the brother with the dark hair?"
 I remember leading him to the Lord, and I was like, "That's the one."
 I really felt, I had quite a few people praying for my family, which obviously we're all really
 hurting.
 I could really feel God's presence supporting us and got to have some great conversations
 with some of my family, which I don't see them that often.
 I mean, there was a lot of bright points. I didn't really know my nephews very well.
 Haven't seen them since we moved down here and got to spend quite a bit of time with them.
 And they're amazing. They're amazing boys. And so men.
 Yeah, they're not boys. They're amazing. Yeah, they're amazing men.
 And anyway, so that there was like those things where I was like, oh God, like there's,
 I see tons of redemption and and it's still hard.
 And it was really hard and I lost my brother.
 Yeah.
 So and he's not in pain anymore and I know where he is, you know, so it's like, it's
 the tension of all of that.
 And I realize like, I'll be walking around cleaning the house or doing whatever.
 And then I just get hit by a wave of sadness and, you know, much like the loss we were facing
 in the fall.
 just trying to feel my feelings and be present with it
 and let it run its course.
 And, but yeah, it was very, very difficult week
 and I could feel God in the midst of a lot of it.
  </li><li>Yeah, there's no getting away from a very hard start
 of the year and undoubtedly you could feel the presence
 of God and the prayers of friends and loved ones.
 So very grateful to everybody who prayed for us
 And also all the practical support you received while in Canada, thank you for your wonderful
 family.
 You know when I was planning what we were going to share, I forgot that, it's not that
 I forgot this is really sad.
 I forgot that talking about death is really sad.
 And I don't necessarily want to jump into something happy and fun to get away from the
 sadness.
 No, of course not.
 But life continues.
 It does.
 And you flew home from saying goodbye to your brother and then what happened?
 Well then I got to cuddle the kids and oh after that and then I got to cuddle you.
 Well you had our anniversary was there. I was more going for it was our wedding at our first
 room but I did appreciate the cuddles yeah yeah our marriage is officially an adult.
 It's an adult. Let me clean your teeth because you have got so much lipstick on your teeth.
 Okay there you go. Thanks darling. Yes our marriage can officially vote. It can.
 Can go to war. Yes, I can't drink though. Can't buy liquor in America. No, no. Could win or in Britain.
 We're 18 years of marriage. 18 years. If I thought about, we should have done a marriage podcast.
 Like, you know, what you've learned from 18 years of marriage? Well, what have I learned in 18 years of marriage?
 We can talk about that later for sure. But wedding anniversary, we... We just went downtown Nashville.
 Didn't want to really be away from the kids again. No, it's just when you'd be away from her. Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So just went away overnight.
 I had a lovely friend come and stay with the kids.
 They were, wanted to keep her
 and they were fine for us to be gone.
 So that's nice.
 But it was still good.
  </li><li>Let me see that more of your take.
  </li><li>I know.
  </li><li>Okay.
 You know what I'm supposed to put sticky tape or something?
 Like why is it running off?
  </li><li>I don't know.
  </li><li>Only you can see it.
 Well, I know if they're watching the video
 but the microphone is right.
  </li><li>It's like you have like pink teeth.
  </li><li>Okay.
 Anyway, that was our weekly catch up. We rested hard. Yeah, we had Christmas. We had new year
 Your brother passed away
 We went and celebrated our wedding anniversary while I tried to get my bad attitude and check
 Yes, all right our main topic. Oh, we have a topic. Yep. Come from a question sent in by Hannah
 Hi, Hannah Hannah. Hannah said this. I am so excited for the journey. You're on and navigate your next steps
 You mentioned you're seeking God's will for your lives.
 Can you unpack your discerning process a bit more?
 Can we ever?
 How do you know when you're walking in the Father's will,
 much love, take care, Hannah?
 Well, Hannah, just so happens
 that we don't have to answer this question theoretically.
 It's true.
 Because just a quick catch up
 if you've not been listening to our episode.
 Agent I used to be pastor at a church here
 that we love very much in Franklin, Tennessee.
 September, we got that go from that church.
 And so we've been wondering what we're going to do next.
 We're firm believers in the goodness of God.
 We're firm believers that God has planned for everybody.
  </li><li>Yes. - Including us.
  </li><li>Yep. - And so we wanted to take November, December
 off just to rest, just to recuperate, so that we'd be making decisions
 out of a place of peace rather than out of a place of, a place of
 urgent, say, or panic, or anything like that.
  </li><li>Yeah. So our first thing is peace is the potting
 Peace is the potting style of revelation. John Paul Jackson would say that. Peace is the potting
 style of revelation. So if you want to know, start from a place of peace. Yes. And then we use a
 three step process. This is not the only way. No, but it's the way we're typically what we do.
 Typically what we do. Yeah. Number one, we start with something that I really don't like to do.
 Very few people do like to do it. That's not true. I meet psychopaths all the time.
 Well, I used to like to do it, but I actually think it was out of an unhealthy place.
 We're talking, of course, about fasting.
 Yeah.
 Now, I meet people who are like, "Oh, I love to fast.
 When I fast, I feel so close to Jesus."
 I'm like, "When I fast, I feel hungry."
 I only feel hungry for about the first six days, and then I'm okay.
 No, it's present in the count of four for all the days I fast.
 I'm like, at no point am I like, "Woo, I'm glad that's over with.
 Now I feel great."
 No, I don't, I, I fully understand fasting.
 I understand why I understand the benefits of it.
 But for me, all of the benefits come after not during.
 Like so these people who are just like,
 oh, I just feel so close to Jesus, feels so spiritual.
 I'm like, no, I don't.
 I would say I've historically been those people
 where I have felt, I have felt closer.
 What about this time?
 Well, I mean, I wasn't, I had just gotten to where
 I wasn't hungry when I got the phone call
 but my brother and that sort of spun everything for me.
  </li><li>Why do you fast?
  </li><li>I fast to feel kind of closer,
 like I'm being intentional.
 And my thought or what I've always understood is
 when you feel hungry, that reminds you to pray.
  </li><li>And that's why I pray without ceasing.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>So the advantage or whatever is that you're not doing
 other things, like you're not, well, I was still feeding the kids, so I still making them food and
 whatever. But every time I feel hungry, I'd be like, right, we're doing something right now,
 we're pursuing you for what's next. And it just, the hunger is supposed to help focus you on what
 it is that you're doing in my head. My favorite verse about fasting. Yeah, Sam 167, I humbled my
 soul with fasting. The number one benefit for me when I fast is I humble my soul. Like
 I'm pathetic without food. You are. Yeah. I mean, you know, any, any sense of self-confident
 strength in my own ability is gone after two meals without food. I'm like, "Father,
 have mercy on me. You're beloved." You know? So I did that, but I was reading this morning,
 Proverbs 16. Let me read you the first couple of verses of Proverbs. Okay. Because this
 profound. Proverbs 16 verse 1, like we're all talking about like how you find the will of God
 for your life. It starts with, "To man belong the plans of the heart, but from the Lord comes the
 reply of the tongue." Verse 2, "All a man's way seem innocent to him, but motives are weighed by
 the Lord." Number 3, or verse 3, "Commit to the Lord whatever you do and your plans will succeed."
 Verse 4, "The Lord works out everything for his own ends, even the wicked for a day of disaster."
 and verse five, the Lord detests all the proud of heart. So there's so much in those first five
 verses, but when I read that, I see fasting as the golden thread that weaves all of those things
 together. Because like point number one, like I'm trying to discern the plans that God has for us.
 Yes. And I've got fear that what's going to interfere with God telling me his plans for us is my own
 desires. And I love that verse too. It says, "All the man's ways seem innocent to him." Yeah, sure.
 And I don't want my plans. Like one of the things that we've really tried to cultivate in our life
 is that we're pennies in the hand of the Lord to be spent any way he wishes. Yes. All right, so we
 have like got to the stage of our life trying to push all our poker chips to the center of the table
 and bet on the Lord. Yes. You go, "Not my will, but your will be done." That becomes really difficult
 when you begin to think that his will might be something you really don't want to do.
 So one of the big things that we've prayed about first of all is like, Lord, are we?
 We want to be people who will go anywhere, anytime, do anything, even if it's not what we want.
 It's no secret that we absolutely love Franklin, Tennessee, and so we'd really love to stay in
 Franklin, Tennessee. But we don't want to do that if you're asking us to be somewhere else to
 get ready. And thank you to everybody who wrote in suggesting that we move to your country. That
 that felt very lovely.
 And I did this, seriously, I did appreciate all of the kind.
 Have you thought about this country?
 Have you thought about this country?
 But we don't want our plans, we want God's plans.
 And that's not religiosity that we've just learned
 that things work best when we do that.
 But how do you distinguish between your thoughts
 and his thoughts and how do you know that you're not like,
 oh God, I'll do anything.
 Asterix, asterix, asterix, asterix.
  </li><li>Right, right.
  </li><li>For me, when I fast, it distills that real quick.
 Yeah, yeah, I feel like you hear better.
  </li><li>Oh, absolutely.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>And then, you know, verse five says,
 "The Lord detests the proud of heart."
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Some of the scariest moments of my life
 is when I realized that I've been wrong,
 but I thought I was right,
 and the thing that kept me from seeing
 I was wrong was pride in my heart.
 Well, when you're fasting, like you humble your soul.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So fasting for me isn't about hunger strike,
 isn't about earning anything from God.
 It's literally about positioning myself in a way
 that I can hear clearly with much less interference
 than normal.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So what that would look like for me and you is
 we would be fasting, which I don't like talking about.
 Like this is the, like I want to help people.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But I also don't want to talk about fasting
 because it's supposed to be done in secret.
  </li><li>You're not supposed to let anybody know.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>Right, but yeah, we fasted for a bit.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Right? And there's lots of different fasts you can do
 and we've talked about that.
 I think one of our episodes, I wrote this down as well.
 if you're the type of person who wants to know more.
 Oh no, it was episode 167, it was Psalm 35.
 So earlier when I said it was Psalm 167, that was wrong.
 Psalm 35, as I humbled my soul with fasting,
 episode 167 is where we talk about fasts
 and different types of fasting.
 So if you're reluctantly interested
 in learning more about fasting, you can listen to our--
  </li><li>That's like great, everybody, if you're
  </li><li>You see, if you're relatively interested.
  </li><li>About that. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Coupled with fasting goes--
  </li><li>Praying. - Praying.
 And when we talk about praying,
 or at least when I talk about praying,
 I'm talking about what we call two-way journaling.
 And two-way journaling is if you were to look at my journal,
 it looks like a transcript of a text message thread.
 So like I'm asking the Lord some questions,
 and then he's speaking to me,
 and I'm writing down what I think he's saying.
 And then I ask him more questions about that.
 And so you end up like my journal is just filled
 this back and forth thread of Jesus speaking to me and me
 speaking to Jesus.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 And we've talked about that as well.
 That's, uh, where have we talked about that?
 Episode 18, but we're about to talk about a course that we're
 going to be running soon where we'll teach you in depth, how to
 journal.
 So if you ever want to know the voice of God, if you ever
 want to learn how to hear the voice, we've got to stay tuned
 because we're going to talk about that in a second.
 Okay.
 But what that would look like is you and I would
 we go to separate rooms, separate rooms, um, and spend time
 journaling and then we would come back together and just share
 What we had heard. Yeah, I loved that. It was so fun. Super vulnerable as well
 Yes, because I would read my journal to you and you would read your journal to me and often we take you mean together
 Yes, well, we took it every day. Didn't yeah, I really loved that because of course when you're fasting any a little bit
 You know, surely we need a bigger cracker than this
 But yeah, we'd go in journal for however long and then we'd come in and we'd share
 Like this is what I felt had the Lord sing and it was tremendous fun. Yeah to hear that we were on the same page
 We're hearing a lot of similar things. Yeah, and then we would soak together and we prayed together and we walked together
 So we were just trying to intentionally
 Spend our days while we're
 Setting aside time to fast to make our day about
 Prayer and hearing from him. Yeah. Now I haven't included this. This is probably like step one is fasting step to his prayer
 Step three. I'm just gonna throw in him. I'm going wild here. Oh one of the things I loved that we have done is
 Then we use declarations
 Declarations is just a fancy word for speaking back to God what he spoke to us
 Yes
 So where there was lots of overlap between what you were hearing and I was hearing or or maybe you would hear something that I didn't
 here, but it would really resonate in my spirit or vice versa.
 We would turn all of those things into a list, a declaration.
 This is what we feel the Lord is saying, yeah, I'm going to do.
 Yep. And then we would say those out loud.
 We turn them into a list.
 We've got them on our phone and every day we would declare back to the Lord,
 which is kind of a funny procedure, but it's totally biblical.
 Yeah. All right.
 Second Samuel seven, one of my favorite chapters of the Bible, the Lord gives
 King David easily won the best prophetic words in Scripture. And the first thing King David does
 is he gets up and he goes into the house of the Lord and then he says everything back to the
 Lord that the Lord had just told him. That's so cool. And it's powerful because then you're praying
 back the very thing that Proverbs said that to man belong with the plans of the harbor from the
 Lord comes to the reply of the tongue and then verse three commit to the Lord whatever you do
 and your plans will succeed. We're literally declaring back to the Lord the very thing he's told us.
 Yes.
 And some of the amazing happens.
 I know it sounds weird, but what happens is you hear in your own voice your spirit agreeing
 with what the spirit of God has said.
 Yeah.
 Does that make sense?
 Yeah.
 Because I think oftentimes when the Lord speaks, Grim Cookus is great phrase.
 He says, God meets us with who he is.
 We meet him with who we're not.
 Yes.
 So God will say some stuff and you're like, how's that going to happen?
 Yeah.
 Well, yeah.
 And there's a fair amount of that.
 Like one.
 But yeah.
 I pass all the problems and you just speak back to the Lord, what's going to be.
 And you're getting your heart in alignment and agreement with what he's saying, which
 then starts to silence the what, you know, the what ifs, those things.
 Yeah.
 But also that phrase like expression reinforces impression.
 What started as a thing that you think you heard from God has now moved to something declarative
 that you're saying, okay, Lord, no, no, my, my spirit is aligning with what your spirit
 is doing.
 Yeah.
 fast, number two prey, number three declare number four,
 probably heard us talk about this most recently on the episode with
 our friend Ben Jackson, episode 272.
 We look for confirmation.
 I'm a big fan of that versus says let every matter be established by two or
 three witnesses. Yes. Yep.
 So, AJ, what is talk to the people about how we do
 confirmations?
 I'll say how we don't do it.
 All right.
 Say how you don't do it.
 We don't share what we've heard and say, can you confirm that?
 which I've heard people say.
 Like I've heard people basically that's essentially
 what they're doing.
 Like I heard God say this, this, this, this, and this.
  </li><li>Do you agree?
  </li><li>Do you agree?
 That's, that isn't what we do.
 What we do is say, Lord, would you have people contact us,
 reach out to us and confirm what you've spoken to us.
 So that it's kind of like a blind confirmation
 as opposed to--
  </li><li>Or we even go one step further.
 Like the last couple of days we've reached out to friends
 and family and just said, hey, we're in a season
 where we've been praying to the Lord,
 we feel like we've heard some stuff.
 Could we ask you to pray for us
 and anything you feel that the Lord might be saying,
 any verses that come to mind,
 any pictures that you get,
 would you mind just dropping us?
 So it's not that we're outsourcing the responsibility
 for our life and future direction to them.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>It's just like, let's see what lines up.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And we're also paying attention to like random phone calls.
 So like I got a random phone call
 from, you know, a highly respected prophet
 who just happened to, I think they butt dialed me really,
 but then called back.
  </li><li>Lord moves in serious ways.
  </li><li>And that was a great confirmation.
 So yeah, we do both, but we don't reach out
 with what we feel like the Lord's saying.
 We just ask people that we trust to pray.
  </li><li>Although it is important to note that eventually we will.
  </li><li>Yes, of course we will.
  </li><li>So we're not trying to be cryptic right now.
 Where we are in the processes,
 we have been praying and fasting.
 We feel like we've heard a lot of stuff from the Lord.
 We've been declaring that every day.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>This week we've been asking our friends
 and our family and those closest to us,
 hey, could you pray and if you get anything?
 They'll take a couple of weeks to just clay all that.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And once we've got that, then we'll start forming
 what we feel like the Lord's been saying out to,
 you know, our trusted friends
 and the people we're accountable to and just saying,
 hey, this is the direction we feel at the Lord
 and we're inviting-
  </li><li>Input.
  </li><li>Input scrutiny, criticisms, curiosity, questions.
 Because the last thing we wanna do is be territorial.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Because whenever you seek the Lord,
 we know in part, we hear in part.
 So even on our best day,
 we're only ever gonna hear part of what the Lord's saying.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so you hear in community.
 And so, you know, in the next couple of weeks,
 we'll just, we'll collect these words that come in
 and then we'll just start forming them out
 and then we'll start talking about it publicly.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Because we feel like we've got the eyes down
 the teas crossed and we've got some sort of confirmation.
 And then like, it's funny though, like I was thinking this morning when the Lord called
 Moses and said, "Hey, go to Pharaoh."
 And he's like, "But we'll give me a sign."
 The Lord says, "The sign will be once you've done that, you'll worship at this mountain."
 That's like, that's not much of a sign.
 Thanks God.
 But sometimes you find confirmation as you walk it out.
 Yes.
 As you head in a direction.
 But that's how we do it.
 probably lots of different ways, but we love fasting just for purifying the heart. We love
 prayer because we're seeking the Lord. We love declaration because we're speaking back to him
 what he's already told us and we love confirmation and then we love distillation,
 you don't have to steal it to others and find out what's there and then we head in that direction.
 Yeah, so I guess what's fun about that question is it's not, as you say, it's not theoretical.
 And we're actually walking out exactly that process right now.
 So those of you that are listening or watching the podcast or the video,
 you're on the journey with us as we walk this whole thing out and literally live
 it before your eyes.
 And also if you get any words for us, feel free to send them in.
 Like we're all always looking for confirmation.
 And that's one of the things we love about the Holy Spirit.
 I mentioned earlier that we're going to be launching a new course.
 Yes.
 And on this course, you're going to learn the actually the very first thing we
 teach, I say we teach you do all the teaching.
 The very first thing you teach is how to hear God's voice.
 You spend a week teaching people how to do that very journaling thing.
 Talk to us as you Jones about the course that you're going to be launching in
 February.
 So a number of years ago, I wrote a book called finding father and it is a
 Bible study.
 So it's a 12 week, Bible study, where we're walking through God's heart for us,
 basically, and looking at places where we need to unhook from things we've
 believed and gather new truths about who he is and who he wants to be to us.
 Yeah.
 It's a question we get asked all the time.
 I just got asked it last night, like, how do you know God's voice?
 And how do you know that God loves you?
 And you're really answering both of those questions, not like theoretical
 theological answers, although it's theological. But it's really an experiential journey.
 Yes. And then a number of years after that, I actually got to record a bunch of videos that
 go with the teachings. Every week. So what we'll be running is an online course where I'm going to
 get to coach you through the Bible study and meet with you and process and answer questions and
 and that kind of thing as we go through this study together and all the video teachings
 and all that.
 So, so if you're in starting off as a new year and you're wanting a deeper relationship
 with Jesus, if you want to know how to hear God's voice really, really clearly, if if
 you hear people talk about their relationship with God and you're like, man, I would love
 more of that.
 This is an excellent, excellent course.
 And so how it's going to work is you've got the book and each week you will read it.
 as they just said, it's a 12 week study.
 You will on your own.
 I think there's five lessons each week.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So you don't have to do it every single day.
  </li><li>No, and they're not huge lessons.
 Like it's purposely designed to not be,
 I'm not going after your head,
 it's going after the heart and connection
 and that kind of thing.
 Yeah, so there's short readings to do each day
 and some processing and questions to do
 and things like that.
  </li><li>And then there's the accompanying video course
 that goes into that week's topic in a lot more detail
 that you can watch on your own time.
  </li><li>Sometimes that week, yeah.
  </li><li>And then every second week,
 you will meet with people live on Zoom
 where you can-- - Yeah.
  </li><li>Answer questions and-- - Yeah, pray for people.
  </li><li>Pray for people to help them through whatever's,
 yeah, if we're getting stuck, that kind of stuff.
  </li><li>And you ran a version of this a number of years ago
 with the final fall of summer school.
 We didn't want to wait 'til summer before launching this,
 so you're gonna be launching it in spring.
  </li><li>Yes.
 from all over the world and the beauty of it is that you can go at your own pace and you
 have some structure because you have you meeting with everybody.
 Yeah, yeah. It was so fun. The last time we did it, I just loved it. So I'm really looking
 forward to doing it again.
 And so if you've bought the book, you're almost there. All you need is access to the video
 course. And if you've bought the video course in the past and you have a copy of the book,
 but you want to get in on AJ's coaching as well, there's an option to do that. And everybody
 who signs up as long as you sign up before February, February 25th is when you kick off.
 So we'll probably shut registration a little bit earlier that week is you'll also have
 a whole online forum where you can post age will be in there active during the week as
 well.
 And for questions, you can encourage one another.
 It's a beautiful, beautiful community of people when you're doing the school together.
 And that's going to be launching.
 If you want information about that, or if you want to sign up or if you want to get answers
 to all your questions for that. If you go to <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/spring or look for a link in
 the show notes.
 Sounds good.
 It's funny, you know, we've done run these courses a number of different times. And it's
 always tricky finding a time that works for everybody around the world.
 Yes, because typically we have cracked it.
 Woo hoo, yeah.
 Figure it out that if we do Saturdays at 2 p.m. Nashville time, that works out for people
 in Europe, that's like 8pm, 9pm for people in Europe, but it's also like 7am for people
 in Australia, and we can get a large population of the world if we do it at 2pm.
 Okay, also we're trying this time.
 Yeah.
 One Saturday.
 Are you ready for a listener's question?
 Yes, I think so.
 I love that you've answered that honestly.
 You pause, you thought.
 You know.
 All right, listen's question.
 This is a sad and a hard question to answer.
 It's a great question, it's worthy of a really good answer from Lydia.
 Lydia says, "I've been a victim of spiritual abuse in the church by my pastor and some
 of the leadership.
 How do I move forward with my relationship with the Lord when I feel so much anger and
 hurt with what had happened?
 This makes me not want to trust people in and outside of the church, especially those
 in leadership."
 Thank you for your ministry, you're both a blessing.
 How would you help Lydia and anybody else who's been through heartache, disappointment,
 betrayal, spiritual abuse by Christian leaders?
 Well, I mean, I guess first of all, I want to say I'm really sorry.
 I'm really sorry that that's been your experience and I'm really sad that that happens.
 Yeah.
 I mean, I think your number one key, which is maybe going to sound really trite, is just
 do your best to forgive as things come up, you know, like, and it may be that you're
 forgiving for the same thing, like, you know, 70 times in a row. But but do your best to
 forgive and probably it'd be good if you had somebody that you could process with.
 So helpful. So I would suggest, you know, seeing a therapist or a licensed counselor
 or something like that who could maybe help you process
 some of the wounding and what's happened
 so that you can kind of get free of it.
 'Cause often I think what sometimes scares me
 is sometimes a Christian responses,
 put a Bible band aid on it,
 like just cover it up with a scripture verse
 and don't feel your feelings.
 And eventually you'll get over it
 and I don't think you will.
 (laughs)
 I really don't.
 I think when the bandaids all start to fall off,
 you're gonna realize it's still there
 and it hurts just as bad, you know?
 And so, yeah, I think getting some help processing
 with safe people would be super important.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think you hit the nail on the head.
 I think the two things I would add about forgiveness
 is unfortunately, the advice of you just need to forgive
 can also be a bandaid, like,
 oh, you just need to have this, you know,
 Bible verse applied.
  </li><li>Sure, yeah.
 I think one of the things that would be really helpful,
 Lydia, to understand is that forgiveness is not an event,
 it's a process.
 So you know, it's not that you wake up and you're like,
 "Okay, damn, I'm gonna forgive everybody."
 And then it will be done.
 No, I think the thing I love about your description is
 you're using really good language to describe
 what happened to you.
 Because often what happens is when we've experienced
 disappointment, betrayal, hurt, or spiritual abuse,
 a whole confusion can come on you.
 We're like, is it me, is it them,
 especially in very, very toxic environments.
 So I love that you've got the language of like,
 hey, this has happened to me,
 which is really helpful because you can begin to heal
 once you can begin to name things.
 But I would say, I would agree with AJ
 that, and you've done a good job of understanding,
 hey, I realize these people have hurt me,
 the Lord hasn't.
  </li><li>Right, now what?
  </li><li>But how can I trust other people
 the Lord's gonna ask me when that's there?
 And I think that's why having a skilled outside
 perspective is really, really helpful. Having people who are skilled in trauma therapy,
 people who are skilled perhaps even in virtual abuse, super, super helpful, where you can
 untangle all of the stuff that naturally surrounds us when we've gone through an experience like
 that. There's some really helpful books that I'll put in the show notes. One that I can
 think of right now is by Dr. Chuck DeGroat, it's called "When Narcissism Comes to Church."
 It's all about narcissistic pastors and leaders. Very, very helpful. And there's another book.
 It's based on Psalm 23. I can't remember the name of the title of it. It was a green cover.
 I'll put a link to that as well. And that's one person's journey of detangling and detoxifying
 coming out of a church experience. The next piece of advice I want to give you, I don't want to be
 cold and callous and hopefully that doesn't come across here.
 But it is important to understand, this is going to sound trite.
 Let me use the example if it's too trite, I'll apologize profusely.
 Let's say that you've never eaten pizza before and you go to a pizza restaurant and you get
 food poisoning from that pizza restaurant.
 Naturally, physiologically, biologically, you're going to be, you're going to have a lot of
 work to do before you ever want to eat pizza again.
 the last time you remember him pizza was just, you know,
 a negative experience and it's horrible.
 Yeah. But also as an adult, you can separate and go, well,
 that was one pizza experience.
 It doesn't mean the next pizza experience is going to be like that.
 And sometimes we have to kind of remove ourselves and go, that was that
 church environment, or maybe it wasn't the whole church.
 Maybe it was that one leader.
 And actually, I actually have to understand that there are other churches
 that are really safe, and there are other leaders that are really safe.
 And I think that's where it helps to have external support because you don't want to
 necessarily rush into that, but nor do you want to allow your pain to dictate your future choices.
 I don't want to be callous in saying that. I think you, Lydia, from the way you're phrasing
 your question, you already understand that and you're looking for some help.
 Lydia, I want to agree with what he just said and just say, I'm really sorry you experienced pain
 at the hand of leaders. And I love that you're asking for help. That's a really good thing to do
 that you haven't internalized it, that you haven't, you know, written a story about it being your fault.
 That's key to healing and moving forward. But I think what AJ said is practicing forgiveness,
 which will be a repeated thing to do, getting some skilled outside perspective, whether that's
 counseling, whether that's therapy, whether that's other resources. And then also being able to handle
 zooming out and realizing this was my experience here. It doesn't have to be my experience here.
 Yeah, there still are other church communities that are safe, that are healthy, you know, and
 while it might take some time to find one, to not give up basically on the body of Christ because of
 a painful situation because then you rob us also of, you know, you rob the body of Christ of
 relationship with you and then you're going it on your own, you're not designed to do that either.
 So I always struggle to answer questions like that, Lydia, because I'm aware that trauma is
 complex. Wounding is rich and painful and you know, there's so much to untangle and it can almost
 seem try and over trivialize and just simplistic. I will just forgive and read a book and move
 at that. Really not what we're saying. And it is the mechanisms by which people can find
 healing. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Don't do it alone. Reach out. I'm glad that you asked. I hope
 that helps. Yes. So our thanks to Hannah and to Lydia for sending in your questions. Thank
 you so much for doing that. It gives us some good things to talk about. Yeah. If you've
 good questions or if you've got things you'd like us to talk about, head to
 lnaj.com/ask where you can fill in those questions.
