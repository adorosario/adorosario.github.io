<p> AJ Jones you're looking resplendent this evening.
 Thank you.<br/>
 And me.<br/>
 Standing of course.<br/>
 Okay, thank you.<br/>
 So tell me about this week.<br/>
 Let's do a catch up.<br/>
 What have we done this week?<br/>
 Well, we had more conference this week, which was fantastic.
 It also seems like a million miles away from now.
 It does.<br/>
 That's because we've had a few days off since then, which has been lovely.
 Yes, work like a dog and then rest like a cat.
 I was like until cats don't do much so yes we work like a fantastic team who made everything
 work wonderfully well.<br/>
 It was great to have Chris McLawney back in Ray Center.
 Yeah it was awesome.<br/>
 It was really good.<br/>
 It was a good finish last weekend with us.
 I know it was very sad.<br/>
 Very very sad.<br/>
 It was amazing.<br/>
 Give me your top three highlights of the weekend.
 Top three highlights of the weekend.<br/>
 I loved listening to David Campbell speak.
 It's just incredibly funny and has a great way of dropping revelation that I've never
 seen before.<br/>
 Obviously, loved having both Chris and Luke were amazing.
 Worship was just outstanding.<br/>
 The lights were great.<br/>
 I liked the lights and all the stuff that we bring in extra for the conference, which
 makes it a bit more fun.<br/>
 Then I also got to sign alongside Annie, who was our interpreter.
 got me back into getting excited about sign and more confident and stuff.
 So you're fairly fluent in ASL, is that right?
 I was fluent in ASL. I wouldn't say I'm that fluent anymore. I maybe.
 Although I realized this weekend, I know a lot more than I thought I did.
 For those of you who've ever been at Grace Center or M&amp;A, and you've noticed A.J.,
 you might be thinking she's been doing prophetic finger dancing. She's actually learning to sign.
 We're trying to relearn.<br/>
 We're trying to relearn a sign. I'm going to go back to your number one,
 David Campbell being really funny. David and I had a good conversation afterwards.
 What percent of his jokes do you think our audience missed?
 Oh, probably a lot of them. He's just got a very British dry sense of humor.
 You would have thought that I would have prepped our audience.
 But it took me by surprise how dry he is. You know what was really funny for me as a
 native Scotsman listening to another Scotsman. I realized how American I've become because
 I wanted to correct all the words he was using wrong in air quotes. So that was, I'm
 using to me to go, Oh, Oh my gosh, I'm, and when I finished speaking, he said, you got
 a real American accent. He said, I said, I like Lloyd Grossman, which will only be an
 insult to those of you who know who Lloyd Grossman is. That's what he said, my accent
 sounded like. I wanted to talk about the last night David spoke on the glory. Then we didn't
 know what to do. I want to talk about not knowing what to do as a church leader when the Holy
 Spirit shows up. And just knowing that you don't want to touch it. Right. Like, I know we don't
 shut this down. I don't want to presume that I know what happens next. So we're waiting. And
 And there's this tension.<br/>
 I don't really feel tension from people per se.
 I think I feel attention because I like knowing what to do.
 And when I don't know what to do, the last thing I want to do is
 think I do know what I'm doing and offend the Holy Spirit.
 I say offend the Holy Spirit.<br/>
 I mean, it's not easily offendable.<br/>
 But at the same time, you know, we spend all this time praying for him
 to come in the presence to manifest that I don't want to rush into.
 Oh, great.<br/>
 The presence is here.<br/>
 Now let's get people saved or let's get them healed.
 or there's something about actually acknowledging and waiting and that's one of the things
 that Jeff Dollar, our senior pastor, is so good at not rushing. Anyway, we got Jesse
 early up to sing. And Jesse's just got this anointing on her when she sings.
 -Mm-hmm. That was amazing. -Who's an Auss? I mean, it's just incredible.
 Several people came up to me on the weekends and said, "You know, if Jesse would just record
 a CD--" -If it was an Auss. -Exactly. It would fly off the shelf.
 -I would. -Yes, perhaps that's a word from the Lord for you.
 -Too many words in your music. Just usanaz will do.
 -If you missed any of the more conference, all the MP3s from the sessions are available
 to download at musthavemore.com. We're very pleased to announce that we, not we, we,
 Graycent or not we, Alan, AJ, have been working on a top-secret project to finally fix some
 of our ability to watch stuff that's been prerecorded, we now have a YouTube channel.
 So if you were to go to youtube.com/graceentertv, you will find all the videos from the conference,
 almost all of them.<br/>
 The Saturday morning session, that was speaking out, we didn't get recorded, but all the
 sessions recorded.<br/>
 That's very sad because you were so handsome.
 I was very handsome.<br/>
 which you can't tell from the mp3 audio either so.
 I mean, you'll just never know.<br/>
 I had so sad.<br/>
 But if you want to go watch any of the sessions, go to youtube.com/gracenter.tv.
 And over the next coming months, we're going to be curating sermons, prophetic words and
 video content.<br/>
 So it's going to be much easier to find stuff because a lot of people said, you know, we
 We can watch online, no problem, by going to Ustream.
 If we want to go and watch something that's been previously recorded, it's a bit of a nightmare
 to find stuff.<br/>
 And so we've been listening to you.<br/>
 And thus, Grey Center has worked hard to produce a YouTube channel for you.
 So go check that one out.<br/>
 All right, darling, we work like dogs.
 Jeff Daller very kindly gave us the rest of the week off.
 Yes, he did.<br/>
 What is downtime for the Joneses look like?
 Well, lots of cuddling are...<br/>
 I love sexy cuddle time.<br/>
 That's not what I meant.<br/>
 Yeah, with our kids.<br/>
 Our poor kitties.<br/>
 Yeah, Tia's had like a low grade fever for a couple of days.
 So she's been super cuddly and MJ is always super cuddly and Abby is just full of energy.
 And so as long as she's coloring or got a game to play, she's pretty much OK.
 But I have to do lots of dates to them.
 Yes, you did.<br/>
 I love Daddy Daugherty.<br/>
 Abigail took me to the library.<br/>
 Now, I have not been on a library since I was in university.
 And they still exist.<br/>
 I was shocked to learn that they exist.
 More than that, I was shocked to realize there was normal people that went to them.
 I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I was in there and I was like, "Oh my gosh, this is packed."
 Aside from the fact they had VHS cassettes for rent.
<strong>VHS.</strong><br/>
 I'm sorry, what is this?<br/>
 1984.<br/>
 I'm not sure, but anyway, it was really, really cool.
 I really enjoyed it.<br/>
 The closest thing I could equate it to was
 like a Starbucks but without any coffee and instead of coffee and coffee paraphernalia
 there was his books. It was really nice atmosphere. So Abigail was very excited she got her first
 library card. We have given birth to a nerd. She's super excited about that. Checked out
 a whole of the books. You were there today for an animal roadshow some sort.
 Animal roadshow. Yeah, some kind of animal guy. I don't know what you call him. Zoologist
 maybe or something that had snakes and some sort of weird desert fox and a big owl and
 stuff like that and the kids could see them and he walked around and he brought this ridiculously
 large, very ugly snake and had it like three inches from my face.
 I was supposed to really attract the snakes.
 No, I mean the little ones weren't as bothersome but this one was massive and then it like uncoiled
 then came right up to my face and he's like, "You're fine."
 I'm like, "I don't feel fine. Get away from me."
 But anyway, yeah.
</p><ul>
  <li>And this morning we went for a walk.
 You actually got me out in nature.
  </li><li>What was your suggestion?
  </li><li>Was my suggestion, which I later regretted
 when we got there and we asked, "My phone had no signal."
  </li><li>Poor, poor Alan.
  </li><li>But I was shocked to say I actually enjoyed myself.
 I ran the ride. - You did great, yeah.
  </li><li>It was a beautiful trail.
 We went for what, a two and a half mile walk,
 which was a little short sight given
 where Tia's legs were so tiny.
 It was really funny because for, I mean, Abby's got quite long likes, but for Tia to keep up with us, she has to jog the whole time.
 Poor honey.
 After she hasn't been feeling more for a few days, it maybe wasn't the nicest thing to do.
 And we didn't bring any supplies.
 So I just lived off the land.
 I just grazed on wood chips, wood chips, leaves, and rained the cactus and drank that.
 It's a lot of my first deer.
 Sure.
 Rankets blood.
 It was awesome.
 No, let's talk about tacos.
 You're thinking about the deer?
 Maybe.
 Let's talk about tacos.
 I like tacos.
 Yeah.
 Not as much as you, though.
 I do seem to be in a taco phase of my life where all I'm eating is, is it tacos or tacos?
 Or tacos?
 Tacos, tacos, tacos.
 Tacos.
 Tacos.
 Definitely not tacos.
 Tacos.
 Tacos.
 I don't know.
 I'm so confused now that I live here.
 Monday we had at the more conference the food trucks and we had yayos original Mexican gourmet food and
 They served us some mahi mahi tacos
 Some shrimp tacos which were absolutely supportive
 And then I'm on a I'm on a pilgrimage. I think to find the best fish tacos in Nashville and what's your decision so far?
 Well, yeah, examiners have some superb, but I'm pretty sure they're not authentic, but they are delicious
 The bonefish has some good ones.
 Garcia's Mexican restaurant had some pretty good fish tacos.
 I thought you liked um, Taziki's better.
 Well Taziki's is a Greek restaurant doing Mexican food, so it was delicious, but it wasn't what I was looking for.
 Right, gotcha.
 If you know of the best fish tacos, please let me know.
 We need to know.
 And I will investigate.
 Right away.
 All right, darling, the topic for this week.
 Wait, wait, we didn't talk about my new TV show I just found.
 under new things like new restaurants, new TV show.
 No one.
 Um, it's called Riot.
 And it's an improv TV show where they have like some regular improv artists.
 And then they have in some guest people, like people from, I don't know,
 modern family and stuff like that.
 And it's hysterical.
 I like improv.
 I think it's quite funny.
 They have to be clever to do it.
 I haven't seen it.
 I cannot comment.
 It's, it's pretty.
 All right.
 We'll go watch after this.
 Okay.
 All right. Now, can we talk about our topic for the week?
 Yes.
 I thought that we would talk about kids now before you tune out because you either have
 kids and you already know everything we're going to say, or you don't have kids, you
 don't have anything to just relevant to. You just hold on. Probably the most common question
 we get asked, well, let's just set the context. We passed our people with a vast majority
 are not married. And then those that are married, don't you have kids? There's a handful of
 people who are beginning to have kids, which is awesome.
 Yeah. It's very fun.
 But the most common question we get asked is, how did you know when it was time to get married?
 And the second question is like the first, how did you know when it was time to have kids?
 So, how did we know it was time to have kids?
 I mean, you were all over me like a rash.
 You said my body's like a clock.
 I mean, I couldn't hold myself back.
 It was horrible.
 Horrible for you, I'm sure.
 That's how I remember it.
 Yeah.
 But in a parallel universe where reality happens.
 I mean, reality.
 we prayed. Then we just pray and we just asked the Lord and I had a dream. Is that what you're
 talking about? That whole scenario?
 Yeah, I do remember those things. I don't remember them happening in that order. I just
 remember one day you coming through and saying, I think it's time that we have babies. And
 what I heard was, I think we should be having sex more. So I was like, sure.
 Of course, that's what you heard.
 I don't know if I also remember that and I remember being really excited and I remember
 taking a lot longer than we thought.
 I spoke about that briefly at the more conference.
 But what happened for you because you went from not wanting a sofa when you meet people
 who are like, who are adamant, you know, I'm never going to have kids.
 I'm like, you're putting it on the stage of life where you're got all the information
 to make that decision.
 I didn't want kids when I was younger or even a teenager in my early twenties.
 I was like, I don't think I want kids.
 I don't think I'll be a good parent.
 I don't really enjoy other people's kids.
  </li><li>Oh, let's talk about that.
 There's a danger, I think, just from speaking,
 especially to some of my guy friends who don't have kids,
 they think because they don't like other people's kids,
 they won't like their kids.
 Can I honestly say,
 I don't really like other people's kids now.
 I certainly didn't then.
 But you'd be round of people's houses
 and you'd be like, "Oh, your kids are adorable."
 For the first 20 seconds,
 I'm neither constantly wanting my attention.
 And so I didn't think I'd be good.
 But what's amazing is when you have kids,
 God gives you this little grace
 where you find your own kids fascinating.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I actually enjoy other people's kids now too.
  </li><li>Yeah, but you know, your own kids
 are much better for you.
  </li><li>Yeah, let me call for a second.
 Of course I enjoy other people's kids,
 but here's what I thought.
 I enjoy other people's kids
 as much as I enjoy the other people.
 So if I'm around people I actually like,
 it's end to have more grace
 than actually tend to enjoy other kids.
 If I'm around people that naturally,
 I don't get on well with, I don't tend to get on well with our kids.
 Right.
 However, my point in saying all of that was just because you don't like kids now.
 That doesn't, that doesn't really mean anything because God will empower you to
 actually like your kids.
 Yeah.
 You brought that one up.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Then what happened?
 Well, we had kids.
 Well, we, because we got married really late, right?
 So I was like, I can't even remember 33, let's say.
 And so when we started thinking about having kids,
 it was only like a year and a half after we got married
 'cause it was like, you know.
  </li><li>We need to get Arnold like Sonic.
  </li><li>Right.
 And something like that.
 And so I started praying and just saying,
 Lord, when do we do this?
 'Cause we traveled full time.
 So our schedule was so crazy
 that I couldn't figure out when we could do this
 and actually make it work.
 So that's why I was asking the Lord for something.
 And that's what you shared about the more conference
 but the whole dream and all that stuff.
 And then we started trying,
 it took us 10 months to get pregnant.
  </li><li>Which, you know, it seems like from speaking to people,
 people either have one or two experiences.
 One, they're like, "Yay, we're gonna have kids."
 And they're trying nothing happening
 and they're kind of shocked.
 And in speaking to our GP,
 they were like a normal couple.
  </li><li>With nothing wrong with them.
  </li><li>With them, it takes at least 12 to 18 months to conceive.
 Like it's not shocking.
 I shouldn't say it takes 12 to 18 months.
 I said, they're not shocked, they're not surprised.
  </li><li>Yeah, she said she wouldn't even recommend me
 for any test or anything until it'd been 18 months.
  </li><li>Right, and then on the other end of the spectrum,
 there's people who are like,
 oh, he just looked at me and I got pregnant.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But that wasn't our experience.
 Took us a while, they at Pray and which was, again,
 spoke about that at a more conference filled with tension.
  </li><li>It's emotional roller coaster.
  </li><li>Emotional roller coaster, but then a baby comes.
  </li><li>A baby comes.
  </li><li>And.
 I don't know what happens.
 I don't know how.
 Yeah, all of a sudden love something in an instant.
 See, I didn't.
 That's the thing that I have to say to guys, like I was a little bit shocked because when
 the baby was born, the baby being Abigail, whom I now love absolutely and incredibly.
 When the baby was born, I think because you spend nine months having an emotional attachment
 and just feeling her move and pushing on her feet.
 I'm not really part of any of that.
 And especially at labor, you know,
 I just mostly stayed out of the way.
  </li><li>Thanks, Lily.
  </li><li>Who's like, am I doing this right?
 Am I rubbing your head the right way?
 I'm not sure what I'm doing here.
 And because our, the birth of Abigail was pretty tense
 and especially the seven days afterwards.
 I don't really have an emotional connection
 until she came home.
 But still, all of that doesn't really give you game plans.
 I want us to talk about baby wise for a second.
  </li><li>Yeah, okay.
  </li><li>Talk about baby wise as if I don't know what baby wise is.
 Tell me what baby wise is.
  </li><li>Okay, well baby wise, that's a short name
 for a book called On Becoming Baby Wise,
 which the author, his last name is Enzo.
 And it's a way of training your kids.
 And what you do is you're doing,
 you're waking a child up, you feed them right away,
 then they have a period of time where they're awake,
 and then they go to sleep.
 and you do that same thing over and over again.
 But you're basically training them
 and you have a schedule based on their age
 and the amount they should be eating
 and the amount that they should be sleeping.
 But for somebody who's never had a baby before,
 it's a great, okay, I have no idea what I'm doing
 and it tells you all the things to look for.
 And because we knew how much she should be eating
 and she was on a regular schedule,
 we knew if she was crying at a certain time,
 she wasn't crying 'cause she was hungry,
 it was probably her bum, stuff like that.
 So it actually made life for us so much easier.
 And she started sleeping through the night
 when she was nine weeks old.
 And she was six and a half weeks preemie,
 so she shouldn't have been able to do that,
 but she could.
 And all the babies have slept to the night really fast.
  </li><li>Let me just say, not sleeping through the night
 is not fun.
  </li><li>Well, we like sleep.
  </li><li>We do.
 I actually like the sound of that schedule.
 I wish you'd put me on a baby white schedule.
  </li><li>Let's all go on.
  </li><li>I don't like to sleep beneath me.
 What was the other one?
 just like to see the neat.
  </li><li>Play.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Play for sure.
 And so we ended up on that because
 we didn't have a clue what to do.
  </li><li>That's right.
  </li><li>And when you're pregnant, like every stage of life,
 you buy a car, everybody starts giving you unwarranted advice.
 You start dating, everybody gives you unwarranted advice.
 You start getting engaged, et cetera, et cetera.
 You buy a house, everyone's like,
 hey, you know what you should do.
 And so when we had a baby, we just started looking around
 and a lot of the people who had
 really stable family lives with great kids
 where it seemed like the parents were managing the household
 and not the kids, we realized, oh, they all did baby Y.
 So we started-- - Well, I asked.
 Yeah, I started asking.
  </li><li>Yeah. - It saved our life.
 And we should probably put in that note
 that we're both planning people.
  </li><li>Yes. - So it really saved our bacon.
  </li><li>Yes. - Absolutely saved our bacon.
 I'm amazed how controversial baby stuff is.
  </li><li>Oh, well, it makes sense because I think
 as soon as somebody else comes along and says,
 well, this is what I do often
 because we're so, we feel so protective
 of how we raised our children,
 that it can feel like the person is saying
 what you did is wrong.
 Which, that's not what, you know,
 I don't think that's what it is.
 I think it's just, this is what worked for us.
 And I think it's a great thing to do with babies,
 but I don't think that it's wrong
 if you decide to do something else.
  </li><li>Right, and you've helped lots and lots and lots
 of moms and new moms learn baby wives.
 In fact, you run a class on it.
 You have some cheat sheets.
 You actually have a blog called lovemummying.com, where you write about all that sort of stuff.
 I was thinking about my favorite thing about being a parent.
 My favorite thing about being a parent is all the different stages of parenting you go
 through.
 Yeah.
 So fun.
 You know, for those of you with teenagers who are laughing right now, going, "Ha ha ha ha."
 Just wait.
 It's just a wait.
 I realize that my eldest is seven.
 So maybe I've been in the glory days of parenting.
 But I just love watching my kids grow from being completely inept and unable to do anything,
 feed, clothe, communicate to having really powerful children like Abigail and T, are
 really powerful in their communication, expressing their thoughts and feelings.
 They're getting really good at communicating to adults.
 I just love all that.
 I love the different stages of the request.
 I wanted to ask you what's your top three things that you love about being
 a parent and just dropping you on the air on the spot there?
 Um, top three things I love about being a parent.
 I guess probably just getting to cuddle them and squish them and love them.
 And I mean, they're, they're yours.
 And there's enormous amount of responsibility and stress that I guess could
 come with that. But I just love that they're mine to love and they're
 mine to. Yeah.
 Right. That's number one.
 Um,
 I love watching them learn stuff,
 like anything, whether it's learning to walk or learning to roll over or
 learning how to read or, you know, it's, it's so exciting.
 And it's such a trip to watch the joy that they have to learn something new.
 And third, ask me what my favorite thing about your favorite thing about having kids
 trying making them.
 Oh, you're so sad.
 All right.
 Jib Judd, our dear friend, he's one said, you know, on reflection, he said, I think
 parenting is the hardest thing I've ever done.
 What do you think has been the hardest thing about parenting?
 I don't know, there's probably a bunch of small hard things.
 I think I don't like it anytime when I feel like I can't help them as much as I'd like
 to.
 So, you know, both Abby and Tia went through a stage where they had nightmares and, you
 know, we could pray over them and put them back to bed and comfort them.
 But, you know, I just wanted them to not go through that, you know.
 MJ right now is teething and he's in pain and there's not a lot I can do but at that so anytime when they're you know that
 They're in pain and my heart would be for them not to be and I can't fix it
 That's good answer. Thanks. I don't know what my hardest thing would be I
 think I
 Think the thing that surprised me is how resilient kids are. Oh, sir. Amazing
 Like I think about how often I have screwed up as a parent how often I've
 Perhaps lost my temper or not been as gracious as I've wanted to be or I've said something that I think is okay
 But then they look on their face tells me it wasn't
 Like I just think about how resilient and how forgiving and how gracious they are. I think that's astonishing
 but I think the hardest thing is is
 I don't know if this is right, but maybe there's a nagging feeling that you're
 That you there's lots of errors you could improve in your bounty
 And maybe I'll go book a session with the killfers on that one.
 Maybe we should book one together.
 I don't know what you would call that, but this sense of, you know, in your professional
 environment, you know, there's grace for continual development, continual professional
 development or lifelong learning.
 And that's fine.
 There's grace for that.
 You know, you start as a junior architect, for example, and you aren't given all the responsibility
 of a senior architect, but you grow and you make mistakes and your mistakes are covered
 by seniors and you know the there's an other sign that you're growing in it with parenting.
 I think especially because nobody's auditing you, nobody's telling you how you're doing,
 you're left to self-evaluate and we're often our worst critics.
 Yeah.
 So inevitably you think you started.
 And there's no training period.
 It's just, "Tada, you have a baby and you're supposed to know."
 Well, I tell you what really helps in that environment.
 I think your kid's to Walmart and then you realize I'm nowhere near as bad a parent
 as somebody's.
 Oh, my.
 No judgment there.
 Just all jokes.
 It's daracal.
 I remember this one time.
 I had been in Publix and I'd seen this child absolutely melting down in Publix, like on
 the floor kicking and screaming legs, you know, that kind of stuff.
 And I said to the person that was with me, I just want you to know that I am not judging
 either that child or that parent because I don't want to actually have that happen myself.
 I know that that's how these things work.
 And so I just, I felt really sad for the mom
 'cause she seemed really embarrassed and I was just like,
 it's okay and I just walked away.
 Well, like two days later, the only, one and only time
 when one of our children's has melted down was in Whole Foods,
 which is kind of like a posh grocery store,
 grocery store, Tia fully melted down,
 like screaming in the cart melted down.
 And then there was people from the church
 came around the corner to see if somebody was being murdered and it was me and my child.
 So that was awesome.
 You want one to give yourself grace?
 Yeah.
 But anyway, all of that to say parenting is awesome.
 Here's the simplest example I can give is I had absolutely no interest in ever going to
 loathe or Home Depot or investigating do-it-yourself projects or home maintenance when I rented a
 a house. It just didn't cross my mind. The day I bought a house, something switched inside
 of me where I wanted to learn how to clean gutters and wire this and that. Suddenly,
 I care about all of this. It's a bit like when you have a, that's probably the simplest example.
 It's like that when you have a kid suddenly there's this whole world that you were previously
 unaware of and utterly uninterested. It just comes online. So if you're thinking about having kids,
 that you're terrified don't be terrified.
 Yeah, I mean, I
 I would honestly say having kids is probably one of the coolest things,
 certainly the best thing that we've ever done.
 And we've done a lot of really cool stuff and, you know,
 been all over the world and had a lot of fun and tried crazy stuff,
 but I wouldn't trade any of it in for our kids.
 Like they're just amazing.
 Yeah, no greater joy.
 I think and being a parent.
 Yeah.
 And I think it's fine to learn
 from other parents, like I have moms that just completely inspire me, you know?
 Oh, for sure.
 And, you know, and I watch them and I just think, okay, I can either sit here and feel
 insecure and self-conscious, or I can actually learn from them and realize, hey, I can do
 that.
 I can learn to, you know, have fun with my kids like that person is, or, you know, be
 more proactive in reading like that person is, or, you know, that kind of stuff.
 So I think I've just realized I've got a lot to learn, but I'm okay with that, for the
 the most part, I mean, I have my days when I get down on myself for sure.
 But I'm trying to look at the people around me that I'm looking at their kids and that
 realizing that they're awesome and they're doing an amazing job.
 And as a result, I'm trying to learn from them.
 Right.
 I was thinking to podcasts ago, we were talking about marriage.
 And I think I made that line that the kill, the Sanford said that marriage is designed
 to kill you.
 children. So like marriage is designed by God to kill the parts of you that need to
 die. And he brings along an accelerated agent called your spouse. But in the same
 breath, they said that children are designed to bring healing. And I think
 about the healing that we personally have had through having kids. Like I'm a
 better person. I'm a better nurture. I'm a better spiritual father. I'm a better
 pastor. I'm a better husband since I've had kids. You know, I noticed when you had
 Abigail, a baby girl, you suddenly got way more in touch with your feminine side.
 You had all this healing. You started wearing pink, you started wearing dresses, you started
 imposing your hair, all this sort of stuff. And there's something about having kids. I think
 that God does an amazing job in terms of bringing healing.
 I don't remember putting both in my hair, but okay.
 You did. I remember my love.
 I was like little ass on the fairy.
 You were like Heidi.
 Skip a little Canadian non-scottish lady.
 She had bows in her hair, I'm pretty sure.
 Anyway, let's wrap this bad boy up.
 I wanted to say a very special hello and we miss you to our dear friend Ryan and Katie,
 who left today.
 We record these on a Thursday.
 They flew out to Mozambique and they're off to do the harvest school for three months in Pemba and Mozambique.
 We miss you already.
 We love you guys and to our dear friend Quinn, we travel back to Scotland.
 Goodbye, Quinn.
 We miss you but he's in a land of Cadbury's.
 Yeah, I'm decent chocolate.
 It's a good place to be.
 We launched a new school video at the more conference for the school supernatural life.
 We'd love you to check it out if you visit the YouTube channel that I talked about before
 or if you check the show notes, there'll be a link to the video.
 We'd love you to watch that.
 We'd love you to pray about coming to do the school supernatural life.
 It's an eight month school designed to absolutely transform your life.
 Adrian, I help run that along with an amazing bunch of people from our church, our staff,
 and our pastors, along with visiting speakers from around the world.
 It's an awesome, awesome investment.
 If you're interested in that, go to schoolofsupernaturallife.org.
 But the reason I'm mentioning this is the deadline for applying is June 15th.
 So you need to make a decision, film the application pretty quick.
 Until next week, we say goodbye.
 Same back time same back channel. Hmm. No, okay. Goodbye
 Bye.
