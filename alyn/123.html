<p> I live in a j's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is I like him.
 I'm buzzing with my chapstick.<br/>
 Yes, your accent has definitely got to brush up this week with our Scottish friends having stayed with us.
 I do care what you're talking about.<br/>
 Would you like me to translate for you?
 You have a chance.<br/>
 I'm a chancellor, which means I'm a person who takes chances.
 I did say last week that we'd start this week's episode with some choice phrases from our
 Scottish friends.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And I've got four of them that I heard them say.
 Okay, I'll translate you say them and then should I should I tell the translation that
 is what you told me they are or should I just tell you what I thought they were.
 Tell me what you think they are and then we'll tell our listeners what they are.
 Okay.<br/>
 I had never heard before.<br/>
 But as we sat down for sushi<br/>
 and they proclaimed, "Unbuzzaloot my chapstick."
</p><ul>
  <li>Yes, I had no idea what that meant at all.
  </li><li>I'm not sure what chapstick had to do with sushi.
  </li><li>No, but he was buzzing at his chapstick apparently.
  </li><li>Apparently that means I'm so excited.
  </li><li>Yes, so there you go.
  </li><li>One of my favorites was when he was in the car
 and you were driving.
 And he said, "Oh, Amber Gambler."
 which was when I drove through a yellow instead of stopping.
 Right.
 So an Amber gambler is one who chooses to run an orange.
 Yeah.
 Hoping it will stay there long enough.
 It was fine.
 I was fine.
 What about you had a chance?
 You already tried that.
 I don't know what a chance is.
 Do you like the way my voice drops an octave when I speak in Scottish?
 Oh, I.
 I had I had all.
 I had a giza.
 I like me, but no by God.
 I know my gaj.
 And then number four,
 yeah, that's gave me the bulk.
 That's gave me the bulk.
 That's gave me the bulk.
 That's pure gugget.
 It made you feel sick.
 Very good.
 Thank you.
 The bulk being nauseous.
 Oh.
 You're getting me the bulk.
 But what's the gugget?
 The gugget is not the gugget.
 You would use gugget to refer to something.
 That's pure gugget.
 That's gross.
 Not pure gugget.
 Very good, babe.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 So.
 Give me a book.
 No, you don't want to give somebody the boat.
 Did you notice the speech that my accent genuinely came back?
 It did.
 It was getting stronger and stronger.
 And then they left.
 They were only here for like four or five days.
 I had a fighting chance of having a Scottish accent in the house again and now they're
 gone.
 Well, they correctly told me I don't have a Scottish accent.
 It's true.
 They said that you've always sounded posh, not real Scottish.
 Well, that's because they're from the land of the Great Unwashed.
 Right.
 in some civility. I don't know. I've been to Dundee. Careful. You're going to have
 been done. Don't you? Sorry. I'm sorry, my friends. We're recording this right now while
 the second American presidential debate is happening. Is it the second or the third?
 The second one. Okay. And we haven't been watching it, but our friend Kate is watching
 it and every so often you just hear go like that. So we want to know what's happened.
 I don't know if I want to know. I kind of do, but I'm kind of, yeah. I wait for the transcripts
 to come through because I can read transcripts obviously faster than I can watch it in real
 time. But you don't get to see all of Donald Trump's facial expressions reading the transcripts.
 I can pretty much imagine that. I'll do some for you. Here you go. Good. Oh, varied.
 Oh, I see.
 Right.
 Okay.
 So for those of you who are wondering what those expressions were, they were in order.
 Donald Trump waiting for a cheeseburger.
 Donald Trump frustrated because one of his socks is missing the tumble dryer.
 And Donald Trump ecstatic because he's just won the lottery.
 Yes.
 Well, I'm very talented.
 Tell me about this week.
 It was a great week.
 We, on the school, we taught on the prophetic and activated all the students and they just
 went for it. It was amazing.
 So activating people in the prophetic sense. Weird.
 But basically we're just teaching them the Bible says that we're to eagerly
 desire spiritual gifts. And if we're going to eagerly desire something that God's
 access to eagerly desire, it only follows that being a good father is going to
 give us what we're desiring.
 Yeah. So then we teach people the basics of prophetic ministry and then we get
 them to practice in a really safe environment.
 And then they're astonished at how prophetic they are.
 Yeah. It's always fun to watch that.
 And you did a great job. You're doing all the games.
 I like doing the games.
 They're very fun.
 You're amazing at organizing about 90 people in a large room
 to do all these prophetic games.
 I don't know if it's amazing or not.
 I don't. I mean, it's just math.
 Well, that's where it falls down for me.
 Right.
 Because I'm like, can I have one, two, three, no, how many people do I need?
 Oh, no, no, not you backwards.
 No, no, row one.
 No, oh, this is too hard.
 Yes, we've seen that before.
 We've learned over the years and seasons just to get that done.
 Yeah.
 And then you were full on DIY cream this week.
 I really was.
 We talked last week about you starting your mudroom/drop zone.
 Yes.
 But this week you finished it.
 It's finished.
 It just needs its hooks as soon as the paint is dry.
 And...
 Do you want to talk us through the process of that?
 Wow.
 Well, you know what?
 I took a picture of every single thing that I did.
 So if somebody wanted to recreate it,
 they could do that just by looking at the pictures.
 Of course you did.
 So I'm going to post like a...
 i don't know how yet you'll help me i suppose i flipping
 i flipping you watch your mind show you know like where you can see the pictures as they progress i
 understand um yeah so i'm going to post that at some point this week look in the show notes and
 you'll find a link to it where you won't well it'll be on instagram yeah okay follow us on twitter and
 we'll post when it just done that okay but it looks amazing i mean honestly you're incredible thank
  </li><li>Thank you, I'm really happy with it.
  </li><li>And I've managed to use all of my power tools this week.
 I used my circular saw, I used my mitre saw,
 I used my power tool, I used my power tool,
 I used my power tool, I used my power tool,
 I used my power tool, I used my power tool,
 I used my power tool, I used my power tool,
 I used my power tool, I used my power tool,
 used my circular saw. I used my miter saw. I used the jigsaw. I used the drill and driver.
 I used my sander. I'm trying to think if there's anything, my nail gun, the brad nailer.
 Oh my goodness, it's so fun.
 It's terrifying watching you run around with a nail gun.
 I had so much fun. I love the nail gun. I'm just looking for things to like. That was
 in the right.
 I'm staying everywhere.
 I thought it was funny for our kids to walk like so today for example you were working on
 the drop zone and because you were working on the drop zone I made the kids dinner yeah
 And I actually didn't because Abigail made all the mac and cheese on her own and Tia said would you teach me how to make steak?
 So I was teaching her how a prep a steak how a heat up a grill how would trim the excess fat off?
 How to turn them how to let them rest?
 She was very proud of her steak and then she just devoured this medium rare steak and at one point I had blood dripping
 out of it. Well the poor honey she's missing teeth on the top and the bottom so she
 has drool anything. She's the cutest little truelling carnivore I've ever met. She's so cute.
 Yeah, iPhone 7 plus update you switched last week. I love it. Really you just sold. Yeah, but honestly the camera is astonishing.
 I know we say this every week.
 I cannot get over the quality of the camera and the quality of the screen.
 I can either.
 It's amazing.
 It is absolutely astonishing.
 Yeah.
 Our main topic for this week is born out of the last couple of weeks.
 Yes.
 It is.
 We're going to talk about hospitality.
 And this is primarily because I have been in my devotions this week.
 I've been reading all about judgment and we can save that topic for a different day.
 But I came across a verse that has nothing to do with judgment.
 And it's in 1 Peter chapter 4.
 And it says this, this, this is going to be one of my most outstanding verses
 that I've ever read.
 And I've of course, I've read the Bible many times.
 So I know I've read this verse or these series of verses, but I've never seen them before.
 OK, but it says this.
 The end of the world is coming soon.
 Cherry.
 Yeah.
 Therefore be earnest and disciplined in your prayers.
 OK.
 Most important of all, continue to show deep love for each other for love covers a multitude of sins.
 Can cheerfully share your home with those who need a meal or a place to stay.
 Very nice.
 And I thought that's quite the progression of statements.
 I mean, it starts with this, this massive mic drop.
 The end of the world is coming.
 The end of the world is coming soon.
 And I'm not being flipping here, but guys, the end of the world is coming soon.
 I've been talking to the Lord a lot about eternity and what that means, but we'll
 save that for another day.
 But the end of the world is coming soon.
 That's a really big loud statement.
 And then it goes on to say, so be earnest and disciplined in your prayers, because the
 end of the world is coming soon, be earnest and disciplined in your prayers.
 But no sooner is Peter finished saying that.
 He then goes on to say, but most important of all, more important than the end of the
 world and more important than praying, show deep love for each other.
 And one of the ways you can do that is to share your home with those who need a meal
 or a place to stay.
 I was like, I love the Bible.
 Like it's so practical.
 Well it's it goes from the end of the world to have people over for supper.
 I mean that's that's quite an amazing thing and.
 I just got to thinking like we in terms of having people over we've had quite a few months of hospitality we started with your mom coming stay.
 Yeah she came for.
 Pretty much all of August right and then we had my dad come to stay.
 And then we just had and in law.
 Can stay. Yeah. And then this weekend, we hosted a bunch of people. We had about 45 people over for lunch on Saturday. I wanted to talk with us. Okay. I live in fear. This is a sidebar, by the way.
 You're not supposed to live in fear? No, but I momentarily stepped into fear. Okay. On Saturday, we wanted to invite everyone over who helped us move house. So back in July, we sold our house, we moved into the house and also coincided with a vacation we booked back in January.
 So about 35 people all told helped us in various ways about loading, moving, cleaning, storing stuff,
 the full gamut of things. And we were so blessed by our community. And so we wanted to have them
 over and just say thank you. Some people who had helped us move out of our old house had never
 seen a new house. And anyway, we just wanted to get everybody together and thank them. And I kept
 to the best of my recollection, very detailed notes about who helped us so that later on I could
 invite everybody over. But the night before I thought, what if I've forgotten people? So that
 was my fearful moment that somehow we have left somebody off the list, we forgot to invite them
 and that would just be terrifying. So if you happen to be listening to this and you helped us move
 and you did not get a thank you card from us and you did not get an invitation to come to our
 Taco thank you party. We're so sorry. Well, we are sorry, but we'd love to know about it. So please
 just contact me. Let me profusely apologize and we will make it up to you for sure. Those were
 those cards were the invitations were mailed out not emailed, but they were mailed out. Yes.
 Hand mailed. Hand mailed. It's one of the rare times I've actually used an analog writing
 scribe to convey my feelings. It's true. You you sat there several evenings in a row hand writing
 out. Thank you, Kurt.
 And I had to write in all caps because I've forgotten how to write in cursive.
 Well, that's probably better because in cursive, your handwriting is virtually illegible.
 Thanks, babe.
 But I love you.
 You do love me.
 You could have been a doctor.
 Anyway, we had 35 people plus kids about 45 in total for lunch.
 We did tacos.
 We cooked a bunch of steak and a bunch of chicken and then had everybody over and everybody
 And it was so much fun, wasn't it?
 It was so fun.
 I loved it.
 I loved it.
 And brimming.
 And we got a mix in our neighbors and our friends
 and our colleagues.
 And anyway, it was just tremendous joy.
 So thank you to everybody who came to that.
 And then today, Sunday, we had all our small group leaders,
 or as many small group leaders as could make it come over
 for lunch after church, too.
 So hospitality has been on the forefront of my mind.
 But when I read that verse, I was really astonished by it.
 I was astonished that one of the kindest ways you can show love is by having people over.
 Yeah, it's quite interesting.
 I mean, we have talked at length before about how we're both introverts.
 So typically, we would rather stay home than go out, although I'm more extroverted than you are.
 Right, but you still need a lot of alone time.
 I need a lot of alone time.
 So I fill up by being alone and I spend energy on people.
 So yeah, it's interesting when even just contemplating,
 okay, we're gonna have two events at our house this weekend,
 and there's gonna be lots of people coming over.
  </li><li>On top of having people stay with us during the week.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>On top of having a normal job.
  </li><li>Yes.
 So it's not like we don't interact with people all day long
 and have normal friendships or whatever.
 But I do find when I know I'm going to have a big spend
 of energy on Saturday, for example,
 on Friday, I'm sort of storing up and I'm a little bit quiet
 or I'm a little bit, you know what I mean?
 I'm just trying to reserve energy for the next day.
 But I don't resent it at all.
 Like I'm just sort of trying to manage energy
 while aligning myself with what's gonna happen the next day.
  </li><li>But do you find having people
 or showing hospitality to be rewarding to you?
  </li><li>Yes, I like it.
 I really like it. It's really fun.
  </li><li>And it's strange, isn't it?
 Because you'd think it would be taxing,
 but it's actually quite the opposite.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>There is, to be sure, a bunch of work beforehand,
 but having people over, there's a tremendous joy.
 It's almost like the Bible knows what it's talking about
 when it says, be hospitable, have people in for me,
 have people to stay.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Well, and our community is amazing.
 Like everybody just sort of arrives and chips in
 and whatever still needs to get done gets done.
 And, you know, it's just fun.
 It's just a big family.
  </li><li>Do you know what also is amazing about our community?
  </li><li>What?
  </li><li>Was we put on our invitations for both events,
 a star and a finished time.
 And we made it clear that it was a drop-in drop-out.
 So, but by and large, everybody showed up at the time.
 Nobody showed up before the time.
 And by the time came for everybody to leave,
 we didn't say anything,
 everybody had just left on time.
 And I felt so loved by that.
 I felt like, oh, you guys are so honoring about that.
 and it was this short two and a half hour burst of time.
 And I loved it.
 And then of course we got Brett Ratliff,
 who's the master doer that before he left,
 he was like, "Hey, you know what,
 what one has to be done?"
 And I turned around and it was in about 15 minutes
 our house was put back to normal.
 So anyway. - It's amazing.
  </li><li>Do you remember two weeks ago,
 I was thinking about, I read that verse
 after this happened two weeks ago,
 A.G. and I were at work.
 And being pastors, we don't have a lot of days
 like these, but there are days when you just get absolutely tanked. You hear some bad news,
 you're involved in perhaps a pastoral situation that's fairly heavy. And a couple of weeks
 ago, we just had one of the hardest, emotionally speaking at least one of the hardest days
 this year. And we just got tanked, didn't we? We got to about lunchtime. We heard some
 really bad news. We were praying through a bunch of pastoral situations. And it takes
 a lot to wind us. Wouldn't you say? Yeah, it takes a fair amount. Yeah. But this
 winded us to the point that we both left at work early. Yeah. We came home about
 330 just so saddened and really deeply grieved in our heart. Sorry, this isn't
 a downward it gets happier. But we came home, we got home about 4pm and
 literally all I wanted to do was just say good night and go to bed at 4pm and
 wake up the following morning because. But we have children so that wasn't an
 option. Yeah, we have children, but we'd also made plans to have friends come over.
 That's right. Yeah, we had. And no disrespect to our friends who are coming over, because
 what I'm going to say next had nothing to do with them at all. But I just couldn't face the
 thought of having guests over. It wouldn't have mattered who it was in the world. I think we just
 hit a wall. But we'd made plans and we want to honor our commitment. So we just did the grownup
 thing and just thought, "Okay, fine, well, let's get ready to entertain people." But what I didn't
 bank on happening was having people over was the best thing that could have happened for us.
 Yeah, there is so much life on it.
 And it wasn't distraction. It wasn't, "Well, I'll just avoid these problems I'm feeling."
 There was genuine, like you say, life. There was a joy in cooking food, preparing food,
 anticipating their arrival, making the place feel like home, planning through the evening,
 putting the kids to bed, and then just sharing face-to-face, heart-to-heart conversations.
 We laughed, we caught up with them, we ate food, we just lounge around on our giant sofa.
 I made dessert.
 You did make dessert.
 Could you make dessert tonight?
 I'm tempted.
 You absolutely should.
 I think that's the word of the Lord right there.
 But it was just such a tremendous night and they left after they left fairly late and
 on what was arguably one of the hardest days and I felt energized and joyful and I was
 like, Lord, there is something to this.
 Yeah.
 And I think, babe, the same with this week as well.
 Typically, our weeks are like every other working adult in the world with kids.
 They're just busy.
 Yeah, nonstop.
 So having visitors in to stay, I was really wondering how is that going to work?
 You mean with like energy levels or?
 Yeah, totally with energy levels, but it was so much fun having Andy and
 Lauren here and really just felt energized by the amount of time that we got to
 spend with them and just knowing like in coming home, they were going to be here
 and we were going to get to get more time and hang out and again get your accents
 spruced up and whatnot.
 I think it also helped that they're fairly robust guests and that they didn't need much
 managing. They rented their own car and we pre-planned like they said, "We know you're busy,
 but when could we get together?" And so that was comforting knowing that they could look
 after themselves. And so they just went out and about during the day and we would catch up with
 them at evening, but still it was so life giving to just sit down and be connected and show
 some hospitality.
 And yeah, I loved it.
 So I don't know.
 And they both like coffee.
 That's important to you.
 It is very important to me.
 It's hard when you have guests stay that don't like coffee.
 Baby, I don't like coffee.
 Is that hard living with me?
 No, I mean, I've, you know, I've prayed about it now and it's, I'm fine.
 I, you know, just.
 very gracious babe. Yeah, thanks. Thanks. It's funny this weekend. We had backed back days
 of hospitality and our friend Kate asked us today, she said, "Did you guys get to rest this
 weekend?" And we really didn't. But yeah, I feel super energized for having people over.
 And I really loved it. Where did you learn a passion for hospitality?
 Well, my, you know, I grew up in a large house.
 And my parents, both of them loved cooking,
 both of them took gourmet cooking classes
 and all that kind of stuff.
 And both of them loved to entertain.
 So they would have, like there would be
 a New Year's Eve party and, you know,
 there might be only 30 or 40 people there
 at the New Year's Eve party,
 but they would have, you know, people over for that.
 Every summer, they had a faculty party
 for whatever high school my mom was working for.
 And so then there would be hundreds of people
 at the house for that, you know,
 'cause in the summer you could use a backyard and stuff too,
 but my parents love to have dinner parties,
 to have people over.
 It's where my deep love of smoked oysters comes from.
  </li><li>I've got the bulk.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>That's pure gugget.
  </li><li>That's pure gugget.
 It isn't, it's really good.
 But yeah, so I mean, some of the,
 I don't have that many pictures of my dad, but I have pictures of him making Spanish coffees.
 I knew yours evil that he would just sit there and sing to himself and light things on fire.
 So my parents were the opposite.
 We didn't have huge parties, but my mom was so hospitable.
 Like growing up, it was absolutely normal for us to always have people in our house.
 Like every Sunday we would, as far back as I can remember, we would always have people at our house.
 after church, my mom and dad would always invite any new visitors.
 And even if there wasn't new visitors, they would always have the young adults,
 always have the students over to our house.
 And it was just a normal thing.
 Any given Sunday, there would always be people in our house, always.
 And while my parents didn't throw parties, my mom always managed to feed
 everybody who showed up.
 And during the week, I never had to ask my mom or dad if somebody could stay for
 dinner.
 Yeah.
 I knew we could always in the same on the weekends, we always had people
 my sisters, myself, we always, always, always had visitors.
 And so there's just this joyous noise in the house
 of always having people to stay.
 I think it's funny because we've inherited some of that
 from both of our parents, having like take for example,
 Christmas, we love having people to stay for Christmas,
 which again, it's a little bit of an enigma
 because we're both really quiet in sealer reserved,
 people are not reserved,
 but we're quiet people and yet every year.
 And sometimes we think,
 oh, maybe we should just do our family this year.
 But whenever we think that our kids are all like,
 who's gonna come for Christmas this year?
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Well, they've got it too, haven't they?
 I think there is something lovely about,
 well, for one thing, we are a family
 and we have a place to stay
 and the Lord loves to place the lonely in families
 and we're happy to be one of the families
 that he places people in for a season or for a day
 or for an event or whatever.
 So I love having people over,
 whether it's Thanksgiving or Christmas or whatever it is.
 And it makes the day less about presence
 and more about family.
  </li><li>Famous formula.
  </li><li>And yeah.
  </li><li>I wouldn't say that we have the gift of hospitality.
 In our scripture talks about all these spiritual gifts.
 I would say we love entertaining,
 we love being hospitable.
 But we've got some friends
 with the genuine gift of hospitality.
  </li><li>Oh, yes, for sure.
 and the difference is amazing.
 So I mean--
  </li><li>It's true, it's totally true.
  </li><li>Some of our friends who when you go to their house,
 they have this magical ability
 to make you feel like you are not imposing,
 like there's nothing they wouldn't do for you.
 And I think their power to make people feel special
 is incredible.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think I also have friends that make people
 feel special by using their artistic giftings.
 like the way that they transform their house into just being a space that says, "I planned for you.
 I want you here. I made everything beautiful for you to come over."
 You know, and you're like, "Oh, that's amazing. We don't so much have that, that piece."
 You're right.
 We more have the, let's eat food and hang out.
 I feel like a bumbling amateur in that side, but it's something I would love to grow better at.
 So I love growing other people's houses. Here's the thing that I noticed,
 is some people's houses are filled with stuff I never think I would ever want to buy. But now
 that I see them in their house I'm like oh that makes me feel special. Oh look what?
 General knickknacks that are put everywhere that I'd never think I'll buy a pair of antlers.
 But when I see them in this place or you know we've got friends who've got like leather-bound
 books that aren't real but they look real and I'm like oh that adds real warmth to the room and
 so there's all these things that just not in my wavelength to think about but when I see them I
 take a photograph and think, "I want to replicate that in our house."
 I love some of our friends who are so gifted, like you said, at creating spaces.
 The trick is to have them come over and just let them loose on our house.
 It's true.
 When we hosted Shailie's shower at the beginning of September, we hadn't even unpacked.
 The ladies that came in and did that, honestly, I was like, "Y'all should start a company
 or something and just throw showers for people.
 Because there's people like me that are like,
 I love it when there's people in my house.
 I love it that's getting used for that.
 I don't think about tying lavender and little strings
 and all the things that are like,
 oh, you thought, I never would have thought of that.
  </li><li>Yeah, it is so amazing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So, I love that.
  </li><li>We need to grow in that area.
  </li><li>I do want to say, however, if you come home with antlers,
 they're growing in the basement.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 buy-in or see it's never something I'd think of.
 That's good.
 I kind of like wandering around world market and looking at all the stuff that somebody
 thought that would be good to put in your house.
 I would never in a million years think to put in my house, but now that I see it, I'm
 like, oh, same with pottery barn.
 It's just a bunch of nonsense that you're like, uh, why would I need a leather clad
 pipe holder?
 But now it looks good.
 Yeah, we should put one.
 Now I need a pipe and a leather clad pipe holder.
 No.
 Do you want to know one of the most interesting verses in scriptures is?
 Sure.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Hebrews 13, verse two.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Don't forget to show hospitality to strangers.
 For by doing so, people have shown hospitality
 to angels without knowing it.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Let me hear it.
  </li><li>Ooh.
  </li><li>Yeah, there's a sobering thought for you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 But I also think about the random people
 that we've met over the years
 because we've had them come stay with us.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>That we wouldn't otherwise be connected with.
 So some of our really good friendships
 come out of them needing somewhere to stay and them being referred to us by people we know who
 are like, "Oh, so on so's in time, but they're going to stay." And we're like, "Oh, they can
 have a stay with us." And now they're friends. And I love that type of thing.
 I do too. I love it.
 What about when you have people to stay, but now you don't want them to stay and you want to
 strangle them? Well, I've given up strangling for Lent.
 That's good. You're a spiritual giant.
 Yes, thank you. Thank you. And so...
 But seriously, there is a thing, like my brother-in-law says, he has the two-night rule, that you're welcome to stay for two nights, three days, and then after that you have to leave.
 And we've stayed way more times than that.
 And my sister, Caris, and her husband Ben, they're super hospitable.
 Like every time we go to their house, they have this amazing ability to make you feel really, really welcome, even though all you're doing is eating through their cupboards of food and reclining in their leather chain.
 in their leather chairs.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But how do you balance that with,
 I guess we do it in short doses, don't we?
  </li><li>Yeah, we do.
 And typically we have sort of some sort of boundaries
 on the front end.
 I mean, if you know you have friends staying in,
 you know when they're flying in and when they're flying out,
 you know, that's fine.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And that's great,
 'cause you've agreed to that on the front end.
 And if it doesn't sound too methodical,
 I can apportion energy to that.
 And you know what I mean?
 He's just like, "Yay!"
 And then I can just enjoy it.
 'Cause I know, you know, I know when it starts
 and when it ends.
 We've had a couple times where we've had long-term
 people stay where they just haven't had a place to live.
 And the Lord's given enormous amounts of grace
 for that as well.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>So maybe we do like people staying with us.
 I don't know.
  </li><li>Well, yeah, let's say we're too excited there.
 We do have probably unknown to most people
 'cause why would you know this unless you were
 with us. But we do have a little dossier that when people come to stay, it explains everything
 about the house, which that removes a lot of anxiety because why would anybody know the particular
 quirks of our life if we hadn't written it down? So, literally, when you come and stay for the first
 time, there's like a little visitors handbook that tells you how to use your house and what our
 sleeping parents are, it's how we get in and out and how to set the alarm all that sort of stuff.
 Yeah. We've been training them how to use the coffee machine now.
 No, you don't trust them. That's my job.
 All right. Let's wrap this up.
 I want to encourage everybody who is listening this week, practice some hospitality
 and you're going to do it for other people, but you're going to be surprised
 that there's going to be a reward for you in doing it.
 But before we leave you, we want to leave you with five top tips for hospitality.
 Are you ready? I'm absolutely ready. Go for it.
 Okay, tip number one, it's better to do it than not to because of worry.
 So well, you know, when you're just like, um, what if it's not awesome?
 What if I can't do it as awesome as, you know, Bubba up the street or whatever.
 And then so you just don't do it at all.
 Right.
 Um, well, that's robbing life from you.
 It's robbing life from other people who want to spend time with you.
 Um, and people do feel loved and welcomed when you invite them into your house,
 even if everything isn't perfect.
 we had some people over where we still had boxes everywhere and they didn't send us any
 complaint letters afterwards. Well, that's the thing. We're talking about our friends earlier who
 are just high producers in terms of the life languages. They're exceptionally gifted at hosting
 people and they think through, "Look, I made these burlap placemats with matching burlap name tags."
 Right. And this custom wreath for the season that we're in. And that's astonishing. But if you're
 living in competition with somebody else's gifting, you're never going to invite people in,
 but people aren't coming to you because of your gifting, they're coming to you because of your
 invitation. So, being encouraged, just have people over and work from there.
 Amen.
 All right. Number two, don't serve the people at the expense of enjoying the people. This
 comes back to, and I fall into this because as a high doer, I want to make sure everything's done,
 but I can actually ignore my guests while making sure the meat is ready for them.
 Yeah. And I have to remember the people of the reason that we're doing this.
 Yeah. If everything else goes wrong, we still succeed because there are people at our house
 and we're enjoying their company. So who cares if the meat is a little overcooked or
 they're over cooked and undercooked? Yes. Significantly better.
 But by all means aim for excellence. But if it all goes pear shaped, it doesn't matter.
 You can laugh about it. It's a great story to talk about the next time you have them over.
 It's true. It's true. Don't worry about tidying. Just focus on cleaning. So basically,
 as long as stuff is clean, people don't really care how tidy it is.
 Right. I mean, you don't want it to be unhygienic, but if it's messy, we all live in messiness.
 Right. And that's real life. I mean...
 Yeah, I want to talk about that. For years, I just thought we failed at living well. And what
 I mean by that is I'd go to other people's houses and they would be immaculate.
 And I would be like, oh, we suck.
 You can leave people on the same stage of life.
 And they'd have young kids and they're both at work,
 but their house is amazingly tidy.
 I mean, beyond tidy, I mean, like the baseboards
 have no cake didn't dust.
 You know, you're just like, wait a minute.
  </li><li>How do you do it?
  </li><li>And so there's this like, I realized,
 at least I hope I'm right in this,
 that that's a fictitious version of life.
 And so if we're all doing that,
 we're all perpetuating a standard that we don't live at.
 like we were joking.
 I mean, of course we tied it our house.
 We had 45 people coming over.
 So we, we tidied more than we normally would on a Saturday.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But the whole idea is like, yes, come on in.
 No, our house is always like this.
 Are you kidding me?
 Yes.
 The sofa cushions are always perfect lately.
 And that's just not real.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so I just want to encourage people to get past that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I mean, you don't want to ignore sanitary situations,
 but if we've got friends who've got kids,
 They don't care that I don't care that our toy room isn't tidy because let's face it as soon as their kids get here with our kids, it's going to be untidy.
 You should see MJ's man cave right now.
 It's destroyed.
 Yeah, but it's perfect.
 That's perfect.
 Yeah, little toys everywhere.
 He's happy as Larry.
 Um, yeah, I remember talking to Alina about that once and just saying, well, if I come to your house, it's perfectly tidy.
 And she's like, okay, if people are coming over, I just throw everything upstairs and then I don't let them go upstairs.
 And I was like, I've done that.
 So it was really funny.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 All right, how about food choices?
 Our suggestion is serve simple foods with large groups.
 This is number four.
 Serve simple foods with large groups.
 So when we had a bunch of people over on Saturday,
 we just did assemble your own tacos.
 We just made a bunch of meat, a bunch of fillings,
 put it all on the side.
 And that way, everybody else could sort out
 their own food allergies, food preferences.
 There was corn tacos instead of as well as flour tacos,
 or you could go flourless if you're--
 But you banned me from making my own salsa and guacamole.
 I did.
 And why was that?
 Because we had lots of tidying to do before they all came over.
 And it takes you hours.
 It doesn't take me hours, but it was probably wisdom.
 But I--
 Cute baby.
 --did have about eight people say,
 is this your homemade salsa?
 And I was like, no, no.
 But nobody cared.
 Yeah.
 But the point is put out lots of simple stuff
 and let people-- do you remember the first meal
 we fed Jeff and Becky and our kids?
  </li><li>Yeah, we made those tie roll ups with the rice roll ups.
  </li><li>This would be an example of everything we've said before.
 So when we moved to Franklin,
 we had our senior pastors, Jeff and Becky,
 and their wonderful kids, Joel and Bethnay, over for dinner.
 But we just moved into house, we had no furniture.
 Remember we'd borrowed some folding chairs from Grey Center?
  </li><li>Yeah, and a folding table.
  </li><li>And a rickety old like hard table as our dining room.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>And we fed them,
 these tie roll ups. So we just put all the ingredients out and said, you know, make your own food.
 There wasn't enough seats for everybody. So we sat on the floor and ate some high food.
 I think we rotated the chairs actually. I think we rotated who got to sit.
 Right. Yeah. But it was still fun and we laugh about it to this day.
 So again, start small. Yeah.
 All right. Last one.
 Last one is practice makes perfect. So just keep trying, keep having events or small group
 gatherings or whatever and just, you know, find the stuff that brings you joy in that and go for it.
 All right. So our challenge to this week is have someone over this week to your house.
 Don't cop out. Don't take somebody out. Just invite somebody over. Even if it's for Taco Bell.
 Taco Bell. No, no, I mean, even if it's for burrito, just people love being invited into other
 people's homes. People who love people don't feed them Taco Bell. All right. Yeah, you cross the line,
 their Jones. Let's wrap up. Okay. We started this week by talking about our school supernatural
 life. We were teaching this week on prophetic ministry. If you were listening to that and thinking,
 man, I would love to learn more about prophetic ministry than do we have something for you.
 We have recorded a five part teaching series that you can download right now to learn how to
 prophesy. I grew up not knowing that you could hear God's voice today. And once I did, and once I
 started learning about profits and people with a gift of prophecy. I always wondered how it worked.
 And so I gave myself really to attending every prophetic conference I could, reading every book
 on the prophetic ministry and worked hard at learning to understand the gift of prophecy. And
 since that point, we have traveled all over the world. We have trained hundreds of people
 how to prophesy. And after more than 10 years of study, 10 years of practice and asking questions
 of every profit we know, we have prepared this super practical, easy to follow teaching on
 prophetic ministry. So we're going to teach you how to prophesy, how to see in the spirit,
 we're going to give you top tips that will help you step out in prophetic ministry,
 we'll give you games that you can practice on your own or with other people. But it's a five-part
 teaching series, and it's the most practical hands-on teaching we know how to prepare. So
 if you would like to learn how a prophesy or even grow in the prophetic, you can download it
 today at our website, go to allen and AJ.com/prophecy.
 And it doesn't matter how you spell that,
 whether an S or a C, it will take you to the same page
 and you can download them today.
  </li><li>All right folks, we'll have a great week in Be Hospital.
