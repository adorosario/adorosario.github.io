<p> a.j. Jones tell me how excited you are.
 I'm very excited.<br/>
 And why are you very excited?<br/>
 I'm excited for a number of reasons, but for one particular reason, we have a special guest today.
 And is it the bearded wonder that is Chris McLaurney?
 It is the bearded wonder.<br/>
 What people can't see is just how nice this setup is.
 Have you ever described it to them before?
 No.<br/>
 It's like, have you guys ever seen TVN?
 That's what this is like.<br/>
 It's just lots of gold.
</p><ul>
  <li>Lots of gold mirrors everywhere.
  </li><li>Cool throw.
  </li><li>Do you like to chandelier?
  </li><li>Oh gosh, yes.
 It's so big.
 Lots of crystal.
  </li><li>Chris, I'm gonna slightly embarrass you.
  </li><li>Oh gosh.
  </li><li>No, but seriously, I know it's not always helpful
 to talk about people being like,
 oh my gosh, you're my favorite worship leader
 and all that sort of stuff.
 Because people feel left out and all that sort of stuff.
 But you have famously said that I'm your favorite worship leader.
 And what is it that makes me such a good worship leader?
  </li><li>You know, I think it's your humility.
  </li><li>And my prophetic dance, the way I blend.
  </li><li>Yeah, of course.
 And the way you rock the kazoo.
 I mean, it just doesn't buzz the way it does for you
 with other people.
  </li><li>It's the Scottish gifting that I have.
  </li><li>Yeah, scales.
  </li><li>All joking aside, completely ecstatic
 that you're here on our podcast.
  </li><li>I'm so happy to be here.
 Thanks for having me.
  </li><li>And you are legitimately one of our absolute
 favorite worship leaders.
  </li><li>Oh, and yourselves.
  </li><li>No, seriously, in the whole world,
 and we can say that because we've traveled
 pretty much the whole world.
 And there's nobody like Chris McLaurney.
  </li><li>These guys are so nice.
  </li><li>I don't know, it's totally true.
 Tell us what you've been up to.
 How was your Christmas?
  </li><li>It was really good.
 We stayed home, it was low stress.
 You have three small children.
 How can that be low stress?
  </li><li>Well,
 I say that as somebody with three small children,
 that isn't a criticism of your children.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Jazzy.
  </li><li>I met your kids.
 No, it was good.
 Yeah, it was just a good Christmas.
 Nobody wanted anything like massive or stupid.
 So everybody got exactly what they wanted for Christmas.
 So.
  </li><li>What did you get?
  </li><li>I got Legos.
 So I getI 
 love you ladies.
 I think you're awesome.
 So for my birthday in Christmas, kind of combined,
 jazz got me the Lego Death Star.
 (gasps)
 It's like a 4,000.
 There's a Lego Death Star?
 It's like 4,000 pieces.
 Get out.
 Well, you can't see what I'm doing
 with my hands on the podcast.
 It's big.
 (laughs)
 I'm right now I'm showing them how big it is.
 And have you built it already?
 So it's a massive box.
 and inside of the massive box, I expected to find a bunch of Legos.
 But what I found was four other boxes of Legos.
 And I'm through box three.
 I haven't even opened box for yet because I had to.
 I went to Toronto for new years.
 It's the gift to keep on giving.
 It's so fun.
 And my kids.
 The power of this fully operational battle station.
 And my kids know like that it's the Death Star because they will die if they touch it.
 I'm the bad guy in the Lego movie.
 That's me right now.
 You're going to glue it all together.
 That's right.
 I don't know if this is an appropriate story, but it is one of the favorite stories you've
 ever told me.
 And you have three daughters.
 Yeah.
 And one day one of your daughters happened to pass a bathroom while you were peeing,
 standing out.
 Yeah.
 set up. Tell us the story of what happened with that.
 No, it's my oldest. Maybe it was the middle one. They're 10 and eight now,
 but this is when they would have been like four and two. She passed by the
 bathroom and took two steps back, looked in and just mouth the word how.
 How?
 I mean, what was your reply?
 The way I remember you tell me was you flushed, you turned around, you were like,
 magic. Yeah, that's, yes, that is definitely something. Yes.
 That sounds just like what I would have said. All right, back to the plot.
 You were in Toronto for New Year, which makes us very jazzed because lots of our friends
 from the loved ones are there. So when I went there, you, we texted them while I was on my way,
 and you told me to say hi to everybody. Right. And so I had planned to journal. I was going to
 I say hi to literally everybody and then write down what they said, but I got bored after three.
 But the Jackson said hi.
 I'm a...
 Some guy don't remember his name, but he said hi too.
 Oh, good.
 Yeah.
 So you just said it once.
 Hi, everybody from Allen.
 That's why I should have done in hindsight.
 But in the moment, it seemed like a better idea to individually go to people and tell
 them that you said hi.
 I just want you to know my heart was in the right place.
 Thank you.
 I appreciate it.
 It's amazing.
 We have.
 I hope you agree with the statement.
 We have an awful lot in common and then we have an awful lot that's not in common.
 Oh, yeah.
 And the thing that we definitely have in common is our low boredom threshold.
 Like we get bored so quickly.
 At which I love about you.
 And so when we were on staff together at Grace Center,
 staff meetings, you were the person that got me through staff meetings.
 That is so funny.
 And yes, but in life, whenever we would do stuff, our boredom threshold would hit about
 the same time.
 So I totally understand the thing about the journals.
 What was the conference like leading worship?
 It was good.
 Did you take a team or use their band?
 No, I went by myself and played with their team.
 They told me it would be the best musicians in all of Canada.
 And was that true?
 I mean...
 You have an addition to the rest of the editions.
 Yeah, I need to listen to that.
 That'd be hard to-Do 
 you guys have new money in Canada?
 Yeah, it's plastic.
 Yeah, it was cool.
 It's so cool.
 I have some on me.
 You can't see it on my case.
 You guys should Google Canadian money.
 It's called a looney.
 A looney?
 Oh, a looney.
 That's the point.
 Oh.
 Is that what you meant?
 But the money is now plastic, which
 means it can go through the washing machine, whatever.
 It doesn't rip.
 It's the same thing that I used for the Euro in Australia has it.
 It's so cool.
 I just realized it may be possible that you listen to this podcast
 and you've no idea who Chris McLawney is.
 And I bet you do.
 You just don't know that you do because Chris has probably written
 some of the songs that you love the most, some of your worship songs.
 No, seriously, like.
 Well, it's funny because when we first started working at Grace
 and I remember some people thought that some of the songs we were singing
 were written by Chris.
  </li><li>Chris, they released a bunch of your songs before you had.
  </li><li>That's fine, that's fine if people think Chris.
 I've done radio interviews for Chris Kilaola.
 (laughing)
 In fact, we should rewind this.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I'm sure that we have Chris Kilaola.
  </li><li>I'll just tell him that it's Chris Kilaola.
  </li><li>Hey Chris, thanks for joining us all the way
 from Sacramento, appreciate that.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's awesome to see you.
 I love, yeah, it's so good to be in Sony, Tennessee.
  </li><li>But you, so Chris McClarney is worship leader,
 songwriter, known for, I don't know, just go Google him.
 I guarantee you've listened to some,
 your songs have been covered by some amazing people as well.
 Like so all the Bethel guys have done a lot of your songs.
 Who was the big thing that got a lot of radio airplay?
  </li><li>Oh, that was a news voice.
  </li><li>The news voice, what was that like for you?
 to hear the new voice, the 12 year old of me
 that still loves Legos, Peter's pants.
 'Cause it's not just the news boys.
 Michael Tate from DC Talk is the lead singer.
 So 12 year old me was like, oh my God, DC talk.
 And the news is why.
 (laughing)
 But you know, 30 something year old me.
 I'm 35 now, back then I was 33.
 33 year old me was like, oh yeah, no big deal.
 I played it cool.
  </li><li>On the inside.
  </li><li>On the outside.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Oh yes.
  </li><li>I'm gonna play word association with you.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I'm gonna throw out worship leader names, right?
 And these are friends of yours.
 So we're not just name dropping.
 These are people you legitimately know.
 I want you to give, like,
 I'm not gonna lend you to one word,
 but just rapid fire, first thing that pops in your head,
 when I say the name, Brian Johnson.
  </li><li>Hunter.
  </li><li>Jen Johnson.
  </li><li>Host.
 Krista Black.
 She's a genius.
 Matt Redman.
 Royalty.
 Look Finch.
 English.
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong>
 And great hair.
 Great hair.
 Do you want me to go and hear the meat?
 I was so mad when he got here, because here this guy comes,
 taking my place.
 He's skinnier than me.
 He has more hair than me.
 He has a better accent than all of us.
 And I had to weigh better accent.
 I was like-And 
 he has hair.
 Not right.
 You know, God, why can't he be bald and fat?
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong>
 because he's a look is that you can wear your bleeder i wanted to not i wanted him to have some flaws that were very visible but right not
 you're like they'll be able to hang it for you
 why god
 and the skinner
 he's like brother
 christyl allah humble mccayla mcclayard
 she's fine
 funny
 jesse early angel voice
 brenton brian
 He is one of funniest dudes. I know that dude is so funny. He'll text he texted me the weirdest
 pictures
 He likes to face swap people oh my gosh. It's it's great
 So I'm gonna say face what Martin Smith. Oh
 Yoda I mean he kind of is he's like the pinnacle of awesome worship writers, so he is amazing, isn't he?
 Will Reagan okay will Reagan
 spontaneous. Very good. Okay, so how do you write songs and what comes first words or melody?
 You people always ask that same question. Wherever you go in the world, people say
 do you write melody or lyrics first? And it's always different. I always, it's
 Yeah, I mean, the way I write songs is...
 Well, it depends. The way I enjoy writing songs the most is to just give a little extra time in
 worship and just do some spontaneous bits and then take, kind of, farm those later for the best
 parts and then write songs around the spontaneous nuggets. It really worked the best.
 Can I jump in on the bit about, so your favorite way of writing songs is letting worship go somewhere, seeing spontaneous what happens, then revisiting that.
 Alright, so here's one of my secret treasures. When I started working at Grey's Town, I found an old hard drive with a whole load of just, I guess it was the soundboard dump, just a mix of live worship.
 It's some of whom I most treasured worship to listen to.
 It's you, it's, I don't know, I don't know who are the musicians because I wasn't there.
 This predates me being there.
 But it's you, Alberto, you know, it was amazing.
 But in the middle, there's this spontaneous refrain that goes on forever and ever and ever.
 And you start singing this one line, "Who is this King of Glory?"
 You just sing it over and over and over again.
 Now, what happened was years later, you have a song on, I think,
 defender of the album called "Who Is This Love Amazing?" Did that song come from that
 spontaneous refrain from years before?
 Yeah, I'd say most of my best ideas kind of come from the spontaneous worship moments.
 Yeah, so that one, well, I think you can play the recording for him, right?
 Yeah, I'll magically...
 I will magically play the clip from years ago.
 What date do you think that was?
  </li><li>Oh, gosh. - Just roughly.
 I mean, we got here 2005.
  </li><li>No, we got here through 2008.
  </li><li>I wouldn't even know. - And 2008.
  </li><li>Oh, in this MP3 says 2005.
  </li><li>Oh, there you go.
  </li><li>So, time's the day. - That's it.
  </li><li>2005.
 And who is this love amazing?
 You wrote that.
 When did that come out?
 It came out 2010.
 I purchased it 2010, as what it says.
 So five years later.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So.
  </li><li>I'm gonna play the before and the after.
  </li><li>Do it.
  </li><li>All right, well.

 You and Jesus, oh baby, oh baby
 If He's coming, oh baby
 Oh, oh, He's coming, oh baby
 Yeah, so the...
 That song came out of a spontaneous time
 time, your love never fails, came out of a spontaneous time. We came to the end of
 a breathe and I just kept playing some chords on the piano in the hospitality
 room at Grace Center. And I just started singing, you know, you make all things
 work together for my good. And then I was like, oh I got to write a song around
 that because it just felt so right. And trying to think of some of the other, it's
 There's just so many.
 There's a few I'm working on right now that have, I feel like I've been singing them spontaneously.
 Because you sing something once and it becomes part of your like, "Oh, well, now it's something
 I might use later."
 So I've had these ideas, these spontaneous bits that I've sung for, you know, 10 years
 maybe.
 And just now I'm getting around to finishing up songs around them.
 What's great about doing it that way is I know that the song works in that live environment as opposed to
 You just write a song maybe it works or it doesn't work
 I heard an interview at one point where you were talking something about the songs of heaven. Yeah
 I feel like I tell this story too much, but
 But it's such a great story. It makes me cry the first time I heard it it made me cry
 I'm gonna tell you two things that made me cry about you. You tell the story first. I keep in drop in you. Sorry
 No, it's fine
 so
 that I was I
 wanted to write a bunch of songs and
 Well, we needed songs for church. They just weren't songs. It said the stuff that I wanted to say and I
 Sit down in my church office with like a
 Concordance and you know different rhyming dictionaries and notebooks and
 Hotlighters and pins of various.
  </li><li>Oh, if you're doing that, it's so hysterical.
  </li><li>Various ink sizes, like one millimeter, bold,
 0.7, fine tip sharpies.
 I had everything.
 Guitars, capos, different types of guitars.
 I still remember it.
 It was that front office at Grace Center.
 Now sit down in there with my notebooks open,
 my Bibles and all sorts of goodies.
 And I asked the Lord, you know, my idea was,
 oh, if I could sing the songs that they sing in heaven,
 that would be like the next, you know, Martin Smith, you know.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I could sing if you love forever.
 And so I asked the Lord, you know, Lord,
 I just closed my eyes, I held my hands out in front of me.
 I just said, Lord, give me the songs of heaven.
 And I felt God show up.
 And it was the most real I've ever felt the Lord.
 And it was something in between like scared and excited.
 Part of me was like, you know, what was me?
 You know, and the other half of me was like,
 here it comes, best song ever.
 And God spoke to me.
 It wasn't like audible voice,
 whatever is right under that.
 He said, Chris, I have the songs of heaven.
 what I want are the songs of Chris.
 And it was like a brick hit me in the middle of my chest
 and I just wept.
 I was just crying everywhere.
 It was the idea that I was looking for a song out there.
 Like, oh, there's these songs that are out there.
 And if we're smart enough, we can put them together.
 And, but the truth is that the song is like inside of you.
 It's something you let out as opposed to find, you know?
 I guess in some ways I've had to learn to search inside of myself.
 So there is a searching and finding, but the real worship isn't, it's the outpouring of
 what's in my heart.
 And yeah, I think the reason why some of my songs have done so well is I'm just so normal.
 Other people have the same feeling in their own heart.
 So I'm the most normal guy.
 No, well, I think everybody probably feels that way.
 Does anybody feel weird?
 Anybody like weirdest brains on that?
 Because what you feel is normal that didn't make any sense you can edit that or leave it in.
 I love that story so much.
 You know the second story I love which I want to tell on your behalf is I remember watching you being interviewed and
 somebody said, well, made you want to be a worship leader and you said, I don't want to be a worship leader.
 I want to be a great father.
 And I just thought, I would imagine, like we've talked a lot about success.
 We've talked a lot about, you know, privately, like over lunch, over coffee, that sort of stuff,
 about how you can look at people who've made it and think, Oh, if I do what they're doing now,
 I'll get what they've got.
 But if people look at you and go, Oh, I want to be like Chris McAron, right?
 The next songs, they've got it wrong because, like, like you said, your heart is actually want to be
 known as a great dad to three kids.
 Yeah.
 It's not my heart to be a world famous worship leader.
 And so the Lord's like, "Oh great, you're seeking first the kingdom of God."
 I'll add those other things to you.
 Here you go.
 Travel the world being a great worship leader.
 Well, it's, you know, I feel, I know there's a calling in my life.
 I feel like Abraham, the Lord made a promise like, "Hey, look up and your children will
 outnumber the stars in the sky."
 I feel like the Lord has given me a call in my life and made a promise in my life.
 And the danger is that we try and make that happen on our own.
 The same way that Abraham made Ishmael, the danger is we make Ishmael's.
 And the bummer about that is Ishmael is always the enemy of Isaac.
 And that thing that you make happen on your own or you're helping God out in some way
 is like the enemy of the real promise that God has for you.
 And I'm not perfect at it, but my goal in life is to not make ishmills.
 And so, on purpose, I just try and rest and the knowledge that God has a plan for me is,
 you know, there is that balance of, you know, when God tells you to step forward, you know,
 moving but for the most part it doesn't, at least for me it hasn't looked like what
 it normally looks like for people getting into the music business. I feel like I've
 gone the opposite direction and ended up in the same place in a lot of ways. Well like
 David who is physically anointed to be king. Like actually anointed by the guy who anoints
 King's to be king and he didn't like he went back to take care of sheep and then doing that in that like act of
 Humility or ignorance. I don't know what the reasons behind it were but that act of
 not taking the kingship, but kind of falling into it along this journey years later
 It is it made him one of the greatest kings ever and
 Yeah, for me, I just try and stay as low as possible and it's humble and
 You know follow what the Lord's saying to do in the moment and which brings up
 What I would say and you know, I love you. So what I say next, you know is with kindness the most
 Frustrating thing about being in relationship with you is
 And i admire it greatly but it goes to such extreme lands that i'm like are you freaking kidding me is your absolute refusal to promote yourself or promote anything that you're doing.
 Like which i love like i in a in a world that doesn't do that like even the christian world and you know you inflex magazine and one of all my because every self promoting themselves but i feel like there's gonna be some sort of middle ground.
 When i observe your life there's no middle ground at all i remember the day i remember the i remember being so furious with you that.
 I happen to be in a staff meeting and i was bored so i went to items just to see what was new and what was new that day was your new album that nobody knew you had recorded,
 had debuted at number eight on the charts and so in the middle of the meeting i just
 interrupted the past is meeting
 and i was ticked
 i was like how in the heck have you recorded an album
 until nobody that you've recorded an album and it's released and it's entered
 the charts at number eight like
 i understand that wanting to promote yourself but
 where your family we want to celebrate you so like how do you is it is that
 really is a good point is it just your intention in your heart to not get caught
 up in that that you've swung to the other degree or, or what?
 I mean, I love your heart.
 But at the same time, it's true.
 There's, I, I don't think the way that I live is necessarily
 like healthy or the way everyone should do it or the best plan.
 But growing up in Nashville, I grew up around people that were always
 promoting themselves.
 Right.
 And when I got into leading worship here, it was like,
 I just wanted to be set apart, you know, just opposite.
 And so yeah, I don't think the way,
 I don't think not telling you guys was the best plan.
 (laughing)
 But I'm glad and I'm sorry, you realize that.
 But you know, I think that it, at least for me,
 I've tried to just be other than, you know?
 And I think that's noble and I think that's lovely.
 It is lovely.
 Yeah.
 I mean, part of it is like just trying
 to keep myself safe because it's easy.
 I mean, that's a downward spiral.
 I mean, you kind of-I 
 don't know.
 I want people to be able to look at my life and say that-and 
 I want to be able to say that the Lord ordered
 those steps.
 And God, honestly, I don't know.
 My mom bought so many CDs
 that my CD went to the top of the iTunes chart
 for mom opening iTunes accounts all day.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I don't believe that for a minute.
  </li><li>So, you know, I honestly,
 I don't know how it did so well,
 'cause I didn't tell anybody,
 but that's just like part of the testimony
 that I feel I wouldn't want to give that up,
 but I don't think, I think you're right.
 I probably should told you guys.
 Well, I think there's, I just wonder if,
 I think part of it is there's a difference,
 so I 100%, when I teach on destiny,
 I use use an example all the time
 because there's stories I'm not even gonna tell publicly
 because it would embarrass you in an under-minored humility
 for me to boast about the stuff I know that you've done in humility and in secret other
 people that don't know, that's promoted you, but that whole thing of like you humbling
 yourself before the Lord and he will lift you up and do time.
 You're seeking first the kingdom and he'll end all these other things to you.
 And you're a real living example of that.
 I think the part that has frustrated me is the other part is I'm not sure you've been
 great allowing other people to celebrate the genius that you are in your community.
 And you're right.
 That had to be.
 Say that again, but louder.
 Yeah.
 You're right.
 You're just going to edit that and other places.
 But seriously, because you are an absolute treasure.
 Like everybody who knows you loves you genuinely because you are a gift and you're a treasure.
 I think, you know, what?
 I mean, it's, I think one of my greatest strengths is also a weakness.
 It's like the thing that makes me want to stay under the radar is the thing that kind
 of keeps me under the radar.
 It's like that.
 And you know, I think I've consciously tried to make efforts, you know, at least recently,
 because I am working on a new record, which I don't know if I'm allowed to talk about.
 I won't, but right.
 But I am working on new record.
 And when your new record comes out, can you come back and tell us about the new record?
 Because I know about the new record and I'm so flipping excited about this new record.
 I wish we could talk about it.
 Just a teensy bit excited.
 How about altEase by saying that we're recording on January 23rd and 24th and then people can
 Google to figure out where that might be?
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Ooh, it's a clue.
  </li><li>It's a clue.
  </li><li>We're gonna do rapid fire.
 All right.
  </li><li>Here we go.
  </li><li>Burgers or hot dogs?
  </li><li>Burgers for sure.
  </li><li>Pepsi or Coke?
  </li><li>Coke.
  </li><li>Shall we?
  </li><li>Does anybody ever say Pepsi?
  </li><li>I hope not.
 Not on this show.
  </li><li>No, you get out.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Shower or bath?
  </li><li>When I was a kid, I was such a bath guy.
 But now I can't be bothered.
 One, our tub is so tiny
 and I'm just too big to enjoy a bath in our tiny,
 regular tub.
 I would prefer baths still though, but I take showers.
  </li><li>Acoustic or electric?
  </li><li>Acoustic.
  </li><li>Beard or mustache?
  </li><li>Both.
  </li><li>Ice cream or cupcakes?
  </li><li>Ice cream.
  </li><li>Chick-fil-A or in and out?
  </li><li>In and out.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>How do I understand that?
  </li><li>But you've never had it.
  </li><li>I've had it several times.
  </li><li>You have never had it.
 You've never been to California.
 Are you kidding me?
 I've had it with you in California.
  </li><li>I don't remember that.
 Pop corner pizza.
  </li><li>Pizza.
  </li><li>Night at home or night on the town?
  </li><li>What's the town?
 What town am I in?
 Is it a big city?
  </li><li>You're an armpit in Nebraska?
  </li><li>No, not at home.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>New York City, Jazzy.
  </li><li>Yeah, at night on the town.
 But yeah, I'm not going out on the town
 if it's Arkansas.
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. There are a lot of people from Arkansas, but
 it's so major.
 All right, serious question.
 And this is honestly, this is what has spent has been occupying all my time at
 the moment is I've been thinking about the annoying thing.
 I've been thinking like John and Carol are on it coming to town.
 They stand on a stage and where the microphones say, holy spirit, we welcome you.
 and the Holy Spirit falls and people are healed and it's just absolute crazy and it's just glory
 and it's amazing. Another person who's a sincere believer, they love Jesus, they have the same
 Holy Spirit in them say the same words and nothing happens. You stand up and you might just play
 an opening chord and I've heard you do this so many times and when you play just maybe the
 opening chord the anointing comes and when somebody else, let's say somebody who's a more skilled
 guitarist and plays that same chord and the Anointing Doesn't Show Up. Why? Do you have
 any insights on that? Yeah, I mean, I think that, I mean, it's a, it's probably really
 complicated issue. Part of it is the anointing that's in my life. Again, I feel like I'm in
 the middle of what God has for me. I just know that this is what I was made to do and I love to do
 and it just doesn't feel right to be able to wake up and be able to lead worship.
 And it's just, I love it.
 I love life.
 I live in the perfect life.
 The other thing I think is the expectancy of people, when John and Carol come, there's
 this expectancy that something's going to happen when he speaks.
 And the same way, you know, we built such a community around worship and there was that
 expectancy that, "Oh, something's going to happen." And I think I bring that up to say
 that it's not the thing about the anointing is it's not something that you... It's not
 something that just happens. I mean, it can just happen. But it's... I've found in my
 life it's something that kind of increases over long periods of time. And I know that
 the level of anointing for lack of a better word for it, that I move in is a direct result
 of decisions that I've made that have nothing to do with leading worship.
 Oh, that's a brilliant question.
 They're like life decisions that the stuff that really matters behind the scenes.
 And it's not, I don't think that it's like sin stuff.
 And that's a, that's an issue obviously,
 but the things that have mattered the most are the,
 the times in my personal life where I've kind of risked it all
 and laid it all on the line for the Lord and for,
 you know, it wasn't like I did it to,
 oh, well, I want more anointing to lead worship.
 So I'll do this thing,
 but it was like some of the hard decisions that I've made,
 I've noticed right on the other side of that,
 that there was an increase in the authority of my life.
 I think part of that is,
 we, you grow and your own skill
 and the leading worship is,
 you're navigating something in the spirit.
 It's not, it's just like anything else.
 you can learn to kind of, you know, work in that realm and you learn how it normally
 moves and feels.
 And the same way, you know, people that judge whether artwork is fake or real, they can
 do it like that.
 They just walk into a room.
 That one's fake, fake, fake, real.
 Al, how did you know?
 I don't know.
 I just felt it.
 And it's the same way for me when I'm leading the worship.
 Well, how did you know what to do?
 I just, I don't know.
 And it's frustrating for people like Alan,
 'cause I know you like to figure out why things work.
 And in such a big way, I just have no idea.
 It's like--
  </li><li>But I think you just gave such excellent answers there,
 Chris.
  </li><li>Oh, you're--
  </li><li>No, no, seriously, dude, I remember one of my favorite
 stories that John on it told me was they went to New Zealand
 and they were in the middle of worship.
 and the worship leader just passed out,
 boom, to the ground.
 In fact, the worship team, all of them just out in the spirit.
 So everybody looks at each other
 and the senior pastor's like,
 we should probably go up and explain something.
 So the senior pastor gets up on the stage to say,
 hey guys, we're not sure what is going on.
 As he gets up on the platform, boom,
 the Holy Spirit hits him and he falls out.
 So now they're looking at each other
 and so they nudge the associate pastor,
 the associate pastor, he gets up to say, just to try and help people understand, because
 people are like, what's going on?
 He gets up and he gets on the stage, boom, down he goes.
 So now they're looking around and it's one of the elders, he gets up.
 Same thing happens.
 They're all gone and they just look at John and say, you go up.
 And as John is walking up the stairs, he's like, Lord, Holy Spirit, what are you doing?
 And the Holy Spirit says to him, John, as you have honored me, I'm not going to do
 I'm now honoring you with my presence.
 And he was the only person that could stand and minister.
 And so just listening to you say, the decisions I made over here that have got nothing to
 do with worship, but there to do with the integrity of the heart or there to do with
 the kingdom or to do with a, you know, humble yourself before the Lord and he'll lift you
 up and do time saying yes to God and obedience.
 Yes.
 It's just amazing.
 As we finish, would you do us a favor?
 There will be many, many, many people who have been inspired by you, for sure, absolutely
 know that, who've been touched by your music and will certainly be encouraged by your words.
 But there'll also be songwriters and budding worship leaders.
 Would you pray for people just to be encouraged and for a release of inspiration and anointing
 on their lives as worship leaders, as crates of people?
 Let's broaden it for people who want to move and crave art.
 Yeah, I can do that.
 Do you want you to stretch your hand toward the radio?
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Please don't close your eyes if you're driving.
  </li><li>Yes, yes, if you're driving and listening to this,
 then congratulations, you have some fancy stereo stuff going on.
 (laughing)
 Awesome.
 Oh gosh, I now have to pray.
 Lord Jesus, just right now I pray a blessing
 on anybody that hears this, Lord, that you would meet them where they are in this moment.
 And I pray, Lord, that you would increase your presence on them and increase their ability
 to receive there.
 Just blow them up like a balloon, Lord.
 And yeah, I just, I wish I had something clever to pray other than just do it, Lord.
 I love it.
 That prayer summarizes your approach to life, Chris.
 It does.
 You're simple, you're straightforward.
 You just believe in the goodness of God.
 He is really good.
 Well, Chris McConnie, you're one of our favorite people.
 You are a freaking genius.
 You guys are amazing.
 And your dear friend, and we love you a piece of...
 You're so sweet.
 And honestly, we love that we're practically neighbors.
 We love that we have to live in the same town.
 We love that we keep bumping into you in the same coffee shops.
 And we love every time we come and lead worship at Grey Centre.
 You're so sweet.
 You're an inspiration to us.
 And thank you for being on the show and have an amazing 2015.
 Can you believe it?
 No.
 Unbelievable.
 Full of adventure, Chris McClarney.
 Yes.
 This year will be an adventure.
 I'm excited about it.
 It's going to be awesome.
 All right, we'll come back and see you soon.
 We love you.
  </li><li>I love you.
