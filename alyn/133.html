<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones and we're back we are back folks do you think we can remember how to do this I don't know we have time.
 Starting up or computer.<br/>
 I think that's the longest break we've taken from podcasting in a couple years it was three weeks yeah.
 three weeks of not recording and really even the last week was a bit of a cheat because we
 you know put our children to work violating child labor laws the world around and i'm sure people
 were shocked and appalled that violation they were very cute they were so cute i hope all of
 you beautiful listeners had a wonderful christmas and an amazing new year let's recap on the last
 three weeks. It could basically be summarized as pajamas and nothing else.
 Yes. I actually managed to spend three days in a row in pajamas.
 I spit on your three days. I think I did three weeks.
 Well, somebody had to go get food, darling and things like that.
 So three days is fairly impressive.<br/>
 Yeah, three days was great. I forgot how to shower.
 Yeah, I noticed. I literally just lived in pajamas.
 It's true.<br/>
 an eight and played with children.<br/>
 We had some vacation days left from the end of the year.
 Yes.<br/>
 So while most Grace and her employees go off on the 22nd, I think, yes, we had seven extra days
 and the kids were in school.<br/>
 So we had a pre-star on our vacation, which was wonderful.
 We got a couple of days with just muggins.
 A couple of days. We had seven days.<br/>
 Well, yes.<br/>
 Yeah, we had four days with them, not at home.
 Because we had the weekend.<br/>
 They were home during that time.<br/>
 Oh, I see what you're saying.<br/>
 You're so literal.<br/>
 It's amazing.<br/>
 I'm so sorry.<br/>
 I can't help it.<br/>
 But we had a pre vacation vacation where essentially it was just us.
 Yes.<br/>
 And and I should know that.<br/>
 I mean, this is the thing I've been most excited to talk about.
 I mean, I know this is the birth of our
 Savior and all of that and good tidings.
 Right.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 All that stuff.<br/>
 But on the first day of my vacation, Nintendo launched their first iPhone app.
 Should we talk about Super Mario run?<br/>
 Yeah, sure. Did you download it? I did. Did you launch it? No. You and I are so different.
 I know, but I never liked it in the actual game. So once I saw it on your phone and realized,
 oh, it just looks exactly like that stupid Mario game. I, oh, I'm sorry. Did I say stupid?
 Like your game? You mean words. I mean, I'm so sorry. Once I realized it looked the same,
 I thought I'm not going to play this.<br/>
 I like Mario Kart.<br/>
 I like the driving one.<br/>
 I think you have a judgment against Mario and Luigi.
 Well, I just don't like that game where you jump and there's bricks and I don't know.
 Manhole covers or something.<br/>
 I just, oh my God.<br/>
 I should get much of you.<br/>
 The game.<br/>
 Well, needless to say, I loved it.<br/>
 I downloaded it.<br/>
 I played it through.<br/>
 I thought Nintendo did a wonderful job of capturing all the charm and magic from all
 of their previous games and compressed it into a format that works wonderfully on the
 iPhone.<br/>
 It was, I got really annoyed because by the end of the day, by the end of the day that
 was released, I saw all these things on the internet that were just like, oh yeah, it's
 just too easy.<br/>
 I totally beat the game.<br/>
 And I'm like, hmm, I don't think you did.
 And some people's version of beat the game and my version of beat the game completely different.
 Well, you're a little bit obsessive, but at least you were sort of competing against other
 obsessive friends.<br/>
 I prefer the word thorough.<br/>
 Oh, okay. I don't know. I don't know.<br/>
 They're obsessive to do the job properly.
 No, but didn't you have to play like each level about 18 times or something?
 No.<br/>
 To get all the coins and the, I don't know, raspberries or whatever it is that you're collecting.
 Oh, wonderful. Wonderful sweet-deluded child.
 Yeah, you play basically, there's, I think there's 24 different levels.
 Right.<br/>
 And each level, you start at the beginning and your goal is to get to the end, which is a flagpole.
 Right. And you have to get past mushrooms that talk.
 or something and turtles.<br/>
 Let me talk.<br/>
 There are turtles in my room.<br/>
 There are koopas.<br/>
 They're not turtles.<br/>
 What?<br/>
 I'm so glad that I married you before I revealed that as a Nintendo person.
 Oh, well, yeah, you kind of got me.<br/>
 The premise of the game is you got to get to the end of the game.
 And and I wouldn't even say that's the premise of the game.
 The premise of the game is to collect all of the coins in the game and get to the end.
 But is there rings and stuff that you collect to there are not rings but for the purpose of this conversation.
 Yes, there are.<br/>
 But once you collect all the pink coins, I think then you have to collect, then it lets you collect all the purple coins.
 And then if you're really, really good, you collect all the black coins.
 Wait, so not in the same time, like you couldn't do them all in one go.
 No, no, the minimum amount of times you complete each level is three times.
 So it's 24 levels, 24 times three years.
 Ah, 72.<br/>
 Wait, 24.<br/>
 Times three yet seventy two times.<br/>
 I think okay i may not be able to play mario but i can do math.
 I wait the point of this rather long drawn out thing was it was it gave me three or four days of tremendous action patch on your right i was competing with friends all over the globe.
 And i would wake up and i would watch will and see where he was at and then i look at work for some clarnie was that and then i get stuck on a level and i feel like i'm never gonna get past it anyway i just absolutely loved it so.
 So well done Nintendo. If you haven't played it, go download it.
 So who won in the end?<br/>
 I don't even remember. Probably Will and Chris.
 I mean, probably Chris because Chris is like a video game savant.
 He's just a genius.<br/>
 He is savant to everything. Let's just face it.
 He's amazing. The band is ridiculous.<br/>
 Absolutely amazing.<br/>
 And it was great encouragement.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 The most important thing was I and I don't want to say that because I'm a grown man.
 It sounds ridiculous.<br/>
 No, say it. What were you?<br/>
 And now I feel like you're mocking me.
 No, I am a little bit. Yeah.<br/>
 I got Princess Peach's cake.<br/>
 OK, good.<br/>
 Dearly. That's awesome.<br/>
 Yeah, that's all I wanted.<br/>
 Well, all right.<br/>
 Well, that's what I basically did for until the children got off vacation.
 And then we want to do something special.
 We wanted to go see Christmas lights.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And so apparently I say apparently because we never good to see it.
 There's jalley stone is it even a national park?
 I don't know if it's national park, but it's up by the opera land sort of up that way.
 There's a big park that has millions of lights and you drive through.
 It takes about an hour to drive through and it's all illuminated and synced to music.
 So we thought we'd take the kids up there.
 Yeah.<br/>
 So we like as soon as they got off the bus, loaded them in the van.
 I had everything ready to go and we drove.
 And even though we got there super early,
 The lineup was like ridiculously long.
 Yeah, I was bored before we even got there.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And I thought there's no way we're going to get through this.
 You weren't going to make it for sure.
 No, well, forget about me.<br/>
 The kids hadn't eaten either.<br/>
 Well, that's true.<br/>
 So we did a yui.<br/>
 We did.<br/>
 And we went to the Gaylord Opry.<br/>
 We did, which is amazing.<br/>
 We have to explain what the Gaylord Opry is,
 because if you're from Britain,<br/>
 people are quite getting what we're taking our kids.
 It is an absolutely massive hotel.<br/>
 It's actually a number of hotels all strung together by these atriums that are huge.
 Like one of them has a river and boats in it kind of huge.
 When I go back in time to being a little boy, I think of America like the Gaylord
 Opera, like, oh, yeah, this is a total normal hotel for Americans.
 Yeah.<br/>
 It is a sprawling Metroplex.<br/>
 It's unbelievable.<br/>
 Of astonishment and at Christmas, I don't even know what their budget is, but they deck it all out
 with lights and nativity scenes.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 you drive up and then you walk around.
</p><ul>
  <li>All the trees and all that kind of stuff are lit.
 Apparently they start wrapping the trees and lights
 in July to get it ready.
  </li><li>Do they really?
  </li><li>Yeah, apparently for opening on Thanksgiving.
  </li><li>Oh, I see.
 Did you just make that up?
  </li><li>No, I read that.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Yeah, so it's amazing and the inside is amazing.
 I mean, MJ just sort of walked in and looked around
 and went, "Wow, is this my life?"
 So he was just, I don't think he remembers going last year.
 Of course, everything's sticking this year, so it was quite exciting.
 They have light shows and fountains and the biggest Christmas tree
 you've ever seen.
 And overpriced burgers.
 Overpriced burgers.
 And so you can walk around and see all this stuff inside where you're not freezing to death.
 Yeah.
 I'm yay for not freezing to death.
 Yeah.
 So it was good.
 The kids loved it and we stopped and had hot chocolate
 and just sort of made the best of it.
 But afterwards, they were like, are we going to see those lights?
 And we're like, no, we're not waiting in some lineup for lights.
 So.
 And then with no exaggeration, our whole vacation was pajamas and food.
 It was fully restful and entirely glorious.
 Glorious food.
 Glorious, glorious food.
 Remind me about Christmas Day.
 Christmas Day was awesome.
 We ate an enormous amount of really good food.
 And we had friends over and we all played games.
 It was good.
 And then there was napping on the very large couch at one point.
 I looked over and everyone was asleep.
 Mm.
 You got a sous vide for Christmas.
 I got a sous vide for my birthday.
 But we bought it at Christmas time.
 Oh.
 Well, you know, that whole hospital thing sort of threw
 a monkey wrench into the whole birthday thing.
 If you and your--
 I'm not going to hospital for my birthday.
 That's what I want to do most.
 You know what?
 I need surgery.
 -Okay. -So talk to me about your sous vide that you got for birthday,
 that you got a Christmas. Explain to everybody what a sous vide is.
 -Well, a sous vide looks like a massive cattle prod. I'm just kidding.
 -It does. -It does. It's a strange looking thing.
 A sous vide is something that you put in a large container of water
 and it heats, it moves the water and heats the water to a specific temperature.
 So you can do things like say, okay, I want to do a medium rare steak and it will say,
 well, then you need the temperature of 131 degrees. And so you set it to that and it brings the water
 to exactly that. And then you put the stakes in and whether they're in there for an hour or three
 hours, they're never going to be more than medium rare. They're just going to stay at that perfect
 doneness. We should know that you put the stakes in like a Ziploc bag or we have a, what do you
 we call it like a food saver that sucks the air out.
 So there's nowhere for the juices to evaporate.
 So the meat, fish, chicken, steak, whatever gets cooked
 in all its natural juices.
 But the weird thing is though it's fully cooked,
 it's not what they call finished, is it?
  </li><li>No.
 So you sear it, whatever it is, whether it's chicken or steak.
 So far we've done chicken and steak
 and with both of them, you sear them afterwards.
  </li><li>It's like backward cooking.
  </li><li>Yeah, it is like back cooking.
  </li><li>You cook it first and then you sear it,
 which is a little odd.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And it's so good.
  </li><li>What are you most looking forward to trying to cook?
  </li><li>Fish.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>I also made, what were those little desserts
 you asked me to make you?
  </li><li>Oh, good Lord, there were little pots of glory.
 They were called pot de creme.
  </li><li>Pot de creme, they did turn out well.
  </li><li>Wait, you sound like you have a Scottish accent,
 a good Scottish accent when you said that.
 It's a French word.
  </li><li>I know.
  </li><li>Okay.
 So speak French and you come out Scottish.
  </li><li>Who knew?
  </li><li>I like it.
 It's apparently very similar to creme brulee.
 It is. It definitely is.
 Except there's no torch sugar.
 Right. So we did torch sugar on two of them, didn't we? Just to try that out?
 Mm-hmm.
 Did you like that?
 Oh, yeah. I mean, it's got all three food groups in it.
 Sugar, sugar and sugar?
 Eggs, sugar, creak.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 It's divine.
 It was really good. I'm considering taking it with us on vacation so we can have those desserts.
 Is that a bad idea?
 Why don't you just make the desserts before you go?
 And then we could just take them in a cooler?
 Yeah, right. Bring it with you.
 we're gonna need to we're gonna need them every day.
 Okay.
 So much for the Paleo weight loss of the beginning of the month.
 And then New Year's Eve, all we did was go to bed early.
 Yeah, that's what we do every New Year's Eve.
 And that we're old.
 Yeah.
 Anyway, the whole time was just marked by downtime.
 It was wonderful.
 We unplugged brilliantly.
 And we know this because in our first day back at work,
 we just didn't know what to do with ourselves.
 Seriously, I taught twice and by lunch time,
 I just wanted to cry slash sleep.
 I was so tired.
 I was like, well, it was this.
 Yeah, getting out of the habit of, I think getting out of the habit of the speed with
 which we run and not running at that speed.
 It was, it was a rough reentry, wasn't it?
 We were exhausted.
 So goodbye 2016.
 It was a great 2016.
 It was a great year filled with blessings and goodness.
 I fully am excited and welcome.
 2017 riddle me this.
 Yes. Do you do New Year's resolutions? I do. You do? Did you keep last years? Mostly, yeah.
 That's why I never bother. What do you have planned for 2017 New Year's resolution wise?
 I mean, I kind of have to look at my journal, but like things like... Go get your journal. I'd
 love to know what it is. All right. And then you've got public accountability.
 Wait a minute. You want public accountability for me, but you've made no New Year's resolutions.
 People can hold me publicly accountable for not having any new resolutions.
 That sounds a great idea.
 All right, go get your journal.
 Okay.
 All right, you got your fancy pants journal.
 I have my fancy pants journal.
 I love this journal.
 Do you want to talk about your journal?
 Yeah.
 I got this journal for Christmas for my mom,
 and it's by Inc and Volt.
 I'll put a link in the show notes.
 And it's awesome.
 I don't know what the name of this particular journal is.
 It's whatever the one that's $40,
 because they have a couple of different ones,
 but I love it.
 It's a shapers dream kind of journal.
 Okay.
 So I guess they're not really New Year's resolutions as opposed.
 They're more like top goals for this year.
 So they're not resolutions to change something that happened last year.
 They're like goals to either get this done this year or continue to do this,
 but they're not like entirely different from resolutions, not even in the neighborhood.
 Go forth in your non-resolution manner.
 Okay, so my first goal is to write or slash finish the Song of Solomon book.
 Okay.
 And then I wanted to do another read the Bible in a year plan.
 And so I have started doing a different one.
 Did you finish last year's?
 Yes.
 No, I didn't do one last year.
 I did one the year before.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Last year I just freelanced.
 Oh, I see just random.
 Yeah, just random, random reading.
 Continue. I put that I have a goal to do a video course for finding father, which we are doing,
 but just that it gets, you know, sort of finished and put together.
 We were supposed to have done that last year.
 We really were. And then we decided to move and we lost our video studio.
 Right. Well, we didn't lose it. We just temporarily displaced it.
 Yes. We still have all of the things for it. We just need to build out the basement,
 which incidentally is also on my list of goals for this year.
 Oh, look at that.
 Yes, that's the next one to do the basement renovation and get the studio up and going.
 And then I want to get some video courses together for people that are in different parts of the
 world so that we could, I don't know, we could give them some teaching or some face-to-face kind
 of webinar stuff. Okay, so you're going to teach on your Taikwondo course? Yes, definitely Taikwondo,
 absolutely. And then some maybe basket weaving and then maybe extreme basket weaving.
 I'm thinking of doing a handspring clinic.
 Oh, wow.
 Okay.
 I can't wait to film that, darling.
 I'm going to need to trampoline.
 I'm pretty sure you don't need to trampoline.
 What do you know?
 I'm never right.
 So that's it.
 There's just things like that.
 Very good.
 And then you, in this planner, you can write weekly goals and monthly goals.
 Do you have any weekly goals for this?
 I have some monthly goals for January.
 Tell me.
 So let me just flip the page here.
 It's analog.
 How quaint don't make fun of my analog journal.
 Okay.
 So my January goals were to do whole 30.
 We stopped doing that about two days in.
 I just scratched that one off.
 Whole third.
 It was more whole one than a half.
 It was about.
 Yeah.
 And they were like, uh, yes, but in my own defense, it was because I was planning on taking a break in the middle and you're not supposed to do that with whole 30.
 but we're going on our anniversary trip.
 Yeah, very good.
 So anyway, yeah.
 Two exercise four times a week, which I've been doing.
 To get 10,000 steps per day, which I've also been doing.
 To complete my notes for the event with Patricia King
 next month, which I haven't done yet, but I have time.
 Beautiful month.
 So my January goals.
 to have daily time with the Lord and spend more time playing with the kids and to invest in our
 marriage slash sex life. Wait, wait, that's in the journal. It's in the journal. It's written
 here in ink. You know, I love that journal. That journal is the best, the best journal.
 Are you so glad I bought this journal? And we have public accountability. How are we going to
 I'm going to keep you accountable for that.
 Well, oh gosh, I don't know.
 If you see a jail and five dollars, just feel free to come out and just give her a
 knowing not.
 Well, well, if you know me really well, you can.
 Um, and then to spend three hours a week writing is in my January course.
 Well, you know, what's suddenly I'm a huge fan of New York's resolutions or goals if you would prefer.
 I prefer the goals.
 Yeah.
 I think what I like about this thing is it breaks it down into weekly goals and monthly
 goals and it sort of challenges you as to, "Hey, what's your action plan to make sure
 that you get those things done and there's blank spots?"
 So I've used some of the blank spots for just asking the Lord for like a word for the week
 and writing that in.
 And so just I'm sort of using it as like journal slash organizer.
 Gosh, you're so intentional.
 Now I feel bad.
 Yeah, you should.
 I'm not in a nap called streaks, which in the current context,
 we're a conversation.
 I was a little worried.
 Sounds like I'm dead again,
 dedicated to enhancing something else, but not that kind of streaks.
 Oh, no, that kind of streaks.
 It's basically looking for a streak of success.
 Yeah.
 Is that right?
 Am I using that in the right context?
 Sure.
 So you can put it into six things that you'd like to form a habit in.
 Yeah.
 And every day you mark them off and you're looking for a streak of a successful one after
 the other without breaking your record.
 Right.
 And it's a beautiful app.
 If you are interested in well-designed iPhone apps and it has an Apple Watch app too.
 So I have six things on there.
 The first thing is my reading.
 I'm also reading the Bible through the year.
 Yeah.
 I've done it many times.
 I really enjoy.
 I have a love hate relationship with reading the Bible through the year.
 There's some times I absolutely love it, just as a discipline, just as a getting an overview.
 Other times I will just spend a year in a verse.
 So I've done both, but this year I'm like, you know what?
 I would really like to read through the whole Bible.
 So.
 And last year, did you do a Bible reading a plan or did you know, I would usually do a theme or a book.
 Okay.
 So I'd sit down with a Lord and I would just ask, you know, where are we?
 What are we doing?
 Yeah.
 And I also did the proverbs of read a proverb every day for the day that you're on.
 And so when I talk about me, Andereen, that's what I'm talking about, is sitting down with
 the whole experiencing.
 What are we reading today?
 But it just doesn't seem to follow any sort of plan anyway.
 Yeah.
 I'm reading through the Bible chronologically or as best as whoever wrote my guide thinks
 the Bible structure chronologically.
 Right.
 That I liked because it's going to sound terrible, but it would be weird when you'd
 read First King, Second Kings, and then you get to First Chronicles, Second Chronicles.
 You've got, I've never read this before, and you think you're lost.
 So I like reading it chronologically.
 Same with the, with the Gospels, you know, I like to read the same event and where they
 appear in the Gospels rather than get confused and think I've heard a story before recently.
 Totally makes sense.
 So, so reading, do my daily reading, then taking my blood pressure, and then weighing
 in.
 I tend to do that, but when I forget, I then get unmotivated.
 If I have an unbroken streak, maybe it's my perfectionist, maybe it's my performance.
 I don't know, but I like doing that.
 We can ask Denise.
 We can.
 Yeah.
 Next time I go for my horse sink.
 And then I'm trying to get all three rings on my watch.
 Yes.
 And you're doing very well, which means I have to get over 450 calories of active calories
 burnt.
 Yes.
 I have to do 30 minutes of exercise a day.
 Yes.
 And I have to stand one minute of every hour for 12 hours in the day, which doesn't sound
  </li><li>It's not difficult, but I almost missed that one one day,
 just 'cause--
  </li><li>Well, you went to the gym and your watch died.
  </li><li>My watch died, and I lost like three hours.
  </li><li>But caught it to you.
 You came home, charged up your watch,
 and then worked out again to get all those points.
  </li><li>I did, 'cause I was like,
 "I am going to have my rings."
  </li><li>But did you see our achievement this week?
  </li><li>I did.
  </li><li>We got a little award, a special January award.
  </li><li>Oh, that's nice.
 See, this is where that Super Mario completionist thing works for me.
 If I can gamify health or gamify my life, it works brilliantly.
 Where are we going up to?
 Daily Bible reading, blood pressure, weight, three rings.
 Then I'm trying to update my moves app.
 I'm trying to track where I am every day.
 And then my last six thing I'm trying to do is update YNAB,
 which is our budgeting software.
 And so I'm trying to make sure that every night before I go to bed,
 my, our YNAB and our bank account is synced.
 So we're managing our money smarter and better.
 That's really cool.
 But that's what I'm doing.
 Can I ask you what Bible app are you using for your reading through the Bible
 chronologically?
 I am using one of the ones in the, what is that Bible?
 I don't have my phone with me.
 I'll put a link in the show notes.
 Okay.
 I, because I, I mentioned this morning when I was, I'm seeing it church, the Bible
 that I'm using, which is, it's by the Bible project, guys.
 We need to talk about the Bible project, guys.
 Yeah, they're amazing.
 The Bible project, guys, are amazing.
 There are a bunch of people out in, I think, Portland, Oregon,
 and they have taken on the ambitious task of doing a 10-minute or so video overview of
 every book in the Bible. And on top of that, a 10 minute or so video and these videos are
 astonishing. They're beautifully animated videos, not just overviews of each book of the Bible,
 but also overviews of major themes of the Bible, and then some other miscellaneous videos. And
 they're absolutely superb. They're absolutely wonderful in explaining the literary genius of
 the Bible. I can't recommend them enough. They're absolutely wonderful. And they have an app called
 their app is called Read Scripture.
 And it's, it's just brilliant.
 So you go through and you can check off, you know, you check off each day as you go
 through and reading the different parts, but they have their videos embedded in as
 you're, you know, thumbing through anything that they think would help you
 understand the passage better or, you know, if, if you're reading one of the books
 that they have a actual video on, then you would start by, you know, watching that
 and stuff.
 So it's brilliant.
 And I just thought it would be fun to do a different version.
 I did the one that you're doing two years ago.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And it is by you version.
  </li><li>That's right.
  </li><li>And it's their Bible app.
  </li><li>And it's their chronological.
 And I think because of the way they've got a structure,
 I can literally link to the chronological Bible plan
 that we're using.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Are you doing that one?
  </li><li>I was doing it with them.
 I just thought when I found the read scripture,
 when I thought, oh, that'd be fun
 to just do something a little bit.
 I have the re-scripture one as well.
 I'm not reading it because it's in the ESV,
 and I don't enjoy the ESV.
 I'm reading New Living Translation.
 I'm actually using my paper Bible that I bought,
 which I just love that discipline.
 It's the only piece of paper I touch
 pretty much all day.
 So I get up and I have my Bible open.
 And even though I have it on my phone,
 I just check it off on my phone, but read it.
  </li><li>Well, I'm not reading it on my phone either.
 I read it on my Bible, but.
  </li><li>But I'm also using the re-scripture app
 to watch the corresponding videos of the books
 I'm reading because I think it's a chronological reading plan.
 It's supposed to be.
 Yes.
 OK, so we're using both of those things.
 We'll see.
 It'll be fine.
 Do you have any other sense goal, excitement,
 overarching view for 2017?
 I don't know.
 I keep the things that I keep hearing from the Lord
 are things like abundance and fullness
 and inheritance and things like that.
 So I guess I'm expecting it to be another year.
 of just encountering the goodness of God.
 But I don't know that I have anything more finite than that.
  </li><li>I have something, but I think I'm speaking
 on it at M&amp;A tomorrow night.
 So it's not well-percolated to being chewing on it
 with the Lord and I'll flesh it out more tomorrow.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And then maybe we can share on that later.
  </li><li>Okay, very cool.
  </li><li>Would you like some listeners questions?
  </li><li>I would.
 I just wanted to tell you one really cute MJ story first.
 So this morning, MJ crawls into bed with me
 and he had heard a loud noise so he came downstairs.
 And he crawled into bed and fell back asleep on me.
 So I was reading this morning, my Bible app with my phone
 because I couldn't sit up and it was dark
 and he was sleeping on me.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But he eventually woke up and he looked over
 and it was just as I was thumbing down
 to one of their videos on the app about the covenants.
 And so he saw the universal symbol for a video,
 you know that triangle on his side
 and he knew what that meant.
 Yeah.
 So he was like, okay, mommy, video, video.
 And so I was like, all right.
 So I pressed it and he watched the whole thing with me.
 But at the very end of the video, have you seen the one in the covenant?
 You know, at the very end, there's like Jesus there and all of a sudden there's like plant
 life and bunnies and all that kind of stuff at the end.
 And he said, oh, mommy, look at what Jesus has done.
 And it was just like, I mean, he's talking about the video.
 You know, isn't that cool that there's whatever.
 But it was this whole video on how Jesus came and restored every covenant that we couldn't
 keep, but he did keep and he restored us into relationship.
 And it just really struck me like it's amazing that the eyes of children are full of wonder,
 you know, and we lose the wonder and I don't want to lose the wonder.
 So I just sort of was really impacted by that this morning.
 Can I share an MJ story?
 Yeah.
 We were out for dinner with him last week and he lost his dessert.
 I forget what he did, but we gave him a choice of MG.
 You can keep doing that if you'd like,
 but if you continue doing that, you won't get dessert.
 But if you change your behavior, you will get dessert.
 And he decided he didn't...
  </li><li>He didn't change his behavior yet.
  </li><li>So I said, buddy, you lost your dessert.
 And so he kind of soaked for a second,
 and then he bounced back.
 And so I was just talking to him.
 And he said, daddy, I'm happy.
 And I'm like, well, oh, it's great.
 I'm, why are you so happy?
 And he said, because I have a plan to get dessert back.
 And I was like, well, what's your plan?
 He's like, distraction.
 And I said, "Oh, tell me more."
 And he said, "I'm going to distract you with my cuteness."
 Yeah, there's no flies on that child.
 All right, listen to his questions.
 Yes.
 Got two brilliant listeners questions.
 Okay.
 First one is from Chelsea.
 Okay.
 She says, "This is kind of a funny question.
 Sometimes I pattern my prayers on the Psalms, especially when I'm suffering
 and looking to turn my eyes back to the Lord.
 But when David suffers in the Psalms, he often calls
 the Lord to humiliate or destroy his enemies.
 So true.
 He does.
 Now that we're in the new covenant under Christ, we should sort of skip those
 parts in prayer, right?
 Or what is a better way to pray those parts while loving our enemies?
 That's a great question.
 Gunan, give us your great answer.
 Well, I think yes, you skip those parts.
 I mean, one, your, your words have power and you don't want to be praying
 things like persecution and such down on anyone. Yeah, I'm just trying to think if I have anybody I would even say as an enemy.
 But if somebody's giving you a hard time, it's certainly not going to benefit you to pray in that way.
 Right. And Jesus taught us to bless our enemies. Yes.
 And so, I mean, we still ask God to rescue us for sure.
 But it seems like in the new covenant, we have no enemies.
 Everyone's just a potential friend.
 Yeah, they're either a friend or not a friend yet or soon to be.
 Sorry.
 I think it's it's right to consider Satan as the enemy and we can
 certainly ask the Lord to frustrate and thwart his plans.
 Sure.
 A great thing that we learn and we teach in second year on the school is
 that whenever you're reading the Bible, especially the Old Testament, a great
 question to ask is, how do I read this in light of what Jesus has done for me?
 So it's a great interpretation process.
 When you're reading trickier versions of the Old Testament, I'm saying, okay,
 what does this mean in light of Jesus or how did Jesus' life answer?
 You know what's going on there, but you're quite right Chelsea.
 We, we don't need to skip them, but we do funnel them through the life of Jesus.
 We bless our enemies.
 can absolutely pray for the plans of the enemy to be thwarted and ask God to bless us and bless
 our enemies. Yeah. I think it's also important to understand, as Paul said, it's not flesh and
 blood that we wrestle against, but usually what we wrestle against is people. It sure feels like
 you're wrestling with flesh and blood. But what does it Chester and Betsy call them?
 Unwitting vessels. Yes. They're unwitting vessels. They're people who are being used by the enemy to
 to accomplish his goal. So if you can love the hell out of people, it's wonderful.
 Yes. Okay. Second question. This is from Brandi and she says, "How does interdependence play out
 in your marriage? I'm currently engaged, which is kind of an awkward limbo season anyway.
 Boy is it. But I find myself struggling to navigate the dance between dependence and independence.
 Do you have any tips for the transition into marriage or for just maintaining a healthy sense of self while still meeting both people's needs for connection?
 So that's sort of the first question that says, are there things that are non-negotiable to be on the same page about and other things okay to disagree on?
 Thoughts?
 That's a great question for us to answer in light of this week's events, where we had a big
 disagreement. Yes, we just kept missing each other. Oh, utterly missing each other and then
 found it hard to find our way back to each other. Yes. But let's leave our thing aside and answer.
 So the skip of questions, our first question is, how does interdependence play out in your
 your marriage. Let's answer that. You are two people becoming one and in the becoming
 of one, you don't lose your independence. You use your independence to serve the other
 persons. Yeah. It's Chip Judd's brilliant line. Marriage is a race to outsurfer one another.
 I find the less that we are serving one another,
 the more that we demand that we get
 while the other person's not giving us.
  </li><li>Yeah, the less you're serving one another,
 the more you have to fight for the things
 that you think you deserve,
 or the things that you think you want.
  </li><li>And what we've learned is I can't demand
 that which you would freely give.
 It just doesn't work.
 You can't take from me what only I can give and vice versa.
 For example, if you demand that I love you in a certain way,
 what you get is not love, you get performance.
  </li><li>Right, yes, I totally get it.
  </li><li>That's what I mean.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And I feel like when we are prioritizing our connection,
 when we are prioritizing our marriage
 and that connection that we have,
 There's way more space for us to be ourselves and different.
 So here's one of the things we're totally different in our social outlook.
 Yes.
 My ideal night off is to be alone at home.
 Your ideal night off is to be with close friends out of the house.
 Yes.
 In connection.
 Possibly dancing.
 Right.
 The chances of me ever wanting to go dancing with you.
 Slim to anorexic.
 Yeah.
 Just not even there.
 Right.
 So how does that work? You don't care that I don't want to go when I'm prioritizing our connection in other areas.
 Yeah, I mean, I think it's tricky, Brandy. I think you're right that engagement is certainly an awkward limbo.
 And it really is that.
 -If for sure is. -And honestly, marriage is easier than engagement, I think.
 As long as you realize marriage is work, it's not just going to be handed to you on a platter.
 it is you getting to work through the stuff that surfaces him getting to work through the stuff that surfaces and
 Choosing in those moments to prioritize one another
 Rather than you know sticking your feet in the mud. Absolutely engagement is such a dance
 Isn't it a dance of time? It's a dance of attention. It's this unrealistic
 limbo state, you brilliantly put it where you are practicing the art of life together
 without embracing life together. Yeah, it's weird. It's really, really weird. So
 do second questions, do we have any tip for the transition into marriage or for just maintaining
 a healthy sense of self while still meeting both people's needs for connection? I think
 knowing each other's love languages would probably help a lot and trying to speak to
 your spouse through those languages.
 I think also recognizing that engagement is not real life.
 The pressures that you're feeling right now die down considerably once you're married.
 Because depending on how stressed you are about the wedding,
 the whole focus can become on the wedding day,
 not on the days that follow them.
 Right.
 You're in this time crunch of like, "This has happened a lot."
 It introduces a whole load of fears
 that tend not to be there once you're married.
 -Yes. I think bringing other people into the mix in engagement is really wise.
 It's a danger that you can become so isolated that you lose perspective.
 Having other relationships, other friendships as part of your free time while you're engaged is really helpful.
 -Probably other married couples that you would like to emulate,
 that you sort of look at their marriage and think, oh, yeah, I'd like a marriage like them and get them to speak into your life.
 We had that in John and Carol and a couple of other couples where we were like, hey, if you see anything on us, call us on it.
 But we also could go to them when we just were butting heads and we couldn't arrive at the same spot.
 And because they'd all been through those kinds of things before.
 There was no judgment.
 There was just like, okay, let's sit down.
 Let us help you with this.
 And yeah, so I mean, having people that can speak into your marriage, that's going to be something that's going to be really valuable.
 Also just going in.
 Are there things that are non-negotiable to be on the same page about?
 And are there other things okay to disagree on?
 Well, yeah, I mean, I think there are some non-negotiables.
 How about Jesus?
 There's a non-negotiable for you.
 Right.
 You know, what about if we think about our life?
 How do we how do we do financial decisions?
 Yeah, together.
 Right.
 So there's a non-negotiable unless there's unity between the two of us we tend to stay with the default
 Yeah, we're planning a purchase we both like to pray about it and we both want an agreement before we move forward
 Yeah
 And if there isn't agreement we've agreed that we won't do anything
 Yeah, and with us we have neither
 Will spend more than this amount of money without talking to the other one, right? It's a pretty low amount
 It's like, oh, you spent a little bit of that talking to me.
 It's so weird.
 But seriously, we, the non-negotiables that we've come up with usually
 revolve around, you know, big, big decisions and we won't peace.
 But then as you grow, you might have non-negotiables where you're like, okay,
 I realize in our marriage, we need to have a date night and that's a non-negotiable.
 So that goes on account or, and again, that will come out of your life language.
 And it's also seasonal.
 Yeah, like when we have kids like right now Friday nights are Friday night family night.
 So the kids are all in age where Friday night we're all going to be as a family in and we're going to play games or going to do a movie night and they get to pick the food and you know that kind of stuff.
 That wasn't there a year ago right and this is a non-negotiable for the season.
 Yeah, you love going to the gym.
 I do.
 And I don't want to go to the gym.
 So we disagree on that but i know it's important to you and i actually benefit when you go to the gym because
 you've got rid of a whole lot of stress and you tend to be happier friend there on the house yeah you are good at let me go for a bike ride.
 Yeah you know first thing in the morning you're like it it sets me up for a good day if i go for a bike ride.
 Yeah i like to say that like that's a regular habit yeah i think it's happened them once every week this year i've gone out for a bike right in the morning you have i am committed to it it's incredible.
 I've loved it. You give me space to do that.
 Baby, you know what? I support your dreams of being a pro athlete.
 Thanks, Durham. You're welcome.
 So, Brandi, yes, there are things that are non-negotiable,
 and you guys get to work out what those things are.
 And it's absolutely okay to disagree on things.
 We, Aj and I fundamentally disagree about a bunch of things,
 but here's what we've learned is...
 Mario Kart.
 I don't... There you go. Aj has no value on video games whatsoever.
 Not at all.
 And I have plenty of value and she doesn't have to make me think like her for our marriage to work.
 Yeah.
 I tell you one thing that I've really loved and I thank God for this all the time is you and I have
 a very high value on high quality goods. I have never ever had to persuade you for the reason we
 need to purchase this thing or when it comes to purchasing things for the home.
 We would both prefer to save up for the high quality item then buy the lower quality item
 and get it faster. Right. Yeah. And I love that about you. Thanks.
 We should actually congratulate anybody who got engaged over the Christmas vacation,
 New Year vacation, a bunch of our friends did congratulations. Congratulations.
 Marriage is awesome. I highly recommend it. Yeah. Yeah. All right, let's wrap this bad boy up.
 All right. First podcast of 2017. Thank you guys for listening to us. We just,
 find tremendous joy. I actually missed sitting down on a Sunday night to record podcasts to be with you guys.
 And we are praying for your 2017, maybe glorious, maybe filled.

 In September, we have our next school year starting for the School of Supernatural Life.
