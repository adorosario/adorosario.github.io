<p> AJ Jones, how are you?<br/>
 I'm well.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 I am great.<br/>
 We bring you this podcast heading north bound on highway 65.
 As if you hear bizarre traffic.<br/>
 That is why podcasting from the car, ladies and gentlemen, hoping this is legal.
 Well, AJ Jones, tomorrow we kick off the more conference.
 Before we jump into more, tell me what you've been doing this week.
 Wow.<br/>
 I'm getting ready for more conference.
 So, just, you know, all the things that you got to do to get ready for big conference.
 Hey, our makeup nails.<br/>
 No, I haven't done any of those things yet.
 That might be tonight.<br/>
 Our kids are at school for summer.<br/>
 They are.<br/>
 Well, almost.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 There will be gets out tomorrow.<br/>
 It's our final day and Tia's out.<br/>
 MJ, of course, is not in school.<br/>
 Which is awesome.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 We didn't go to any new restaurants this week, but I did concoct a fabulous meal the other night
 We had Ryan and Katie and Quinn over as a farewell as they head off to Iris and to Scotland
 We had<br/>
 Some steak with which was great. There's a thing that finished it was the fantastic lemon parsley butter
 But I found this recipe before I wasn't sure would work
 I've never thought of having lemon butter on a steak before no
 I mean either and I didn't think it would be good if I'm gonna be honest, but it was awesome
 Your confidence in my connery skills not with Stanley. It was amazing. I was amazed at how summery
 steak felt<br/>
 Yeah, along with slow roasted corn on the cob and a caprizy salad is it is caprizy is that what you say not caprizy?
 I think it's caprizy caprizy salad. Yeah, it was yummy. You managed to invent your own drink at frothy monkey
 Did they have a new or right now?<br/>
 They're running a thing of a coconut cream latte and I thought what could make a coconut cream latte even better
 I know mocha<br/>
 So I invented my own almond milk mocha coconut cream latte and haza
 It's got a really catchy title<br/>
 You should just do the what's it called when you take the first letter of her reward oh
 Oh, what is that called? I have no idea. Yeah, that thing. Antigram? No. No, not an anagram.
 Ah, something. One of those things. You should call it a gigninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninninn
 round up. Ah something. Anyway, you should call it a gignene, I
 I'll have a gignene, to go please. Would you like the iced? Oh yes,
 please. We haven't had much time to do TV, but we have made time for 24.
 Yes. What are you feeling about new season 24? I don't know. I'm sort of
 at the same place that I always am with 24 when you're only like three or four episodes in of
 you know that whatever the current storyline is is not the main storyline because you're only
 a couple hours in and you know Jack's not gonna die so I'm not fully invested yet.
 So you're a 24 cynic? I'm a I am I'm afraid to say but I still want to watch it it's just that
 I'm I could also play a game on my phone while watching it
 Very good. It's also interesting. It's all happening in the UK. It is which is funny for me. It's nice. Yeah
 Yeah, it makes us stuff up a little bit with some reader questions that came in which I want to take some time to answer
 Diana asked and Diana presumably by the fact that you sent this in you're okay with moving this on air
 This is a fantastic question<br/>
 You wrote hello. I was just recently quote unquote prophesied to from a family member
 He was sitting nearby me in the kitchen and suddenly he says he's unable to see anything
 Then he looks towards me and says something about I'm living in fear and that I'm greater than the anointed one
 Then he quote unquote wakes up and asks if anything happened
 Later that day he confronts me and says I need to stop mocking God because of my unbelief
 What are your thoughts on this situation? Well, I have many thoughts on this situation, but my first thought is that's not
 being prophesied over<br/>
 Yeah, throw it out. That's being weird to do over. Yeah, so a couple of things
 New Testament guidelines for prophecies that it's encouraging
 Edification, exhortation and comfort are your safety lines for that?
 So kind of feels like a rebuke that you're living in fear and then you need to stop mocking God and then sign of all
 Who just to weigh that word just against scripture?
 Nobody's greater than the anointed one so I don't know who your family member is or why they're
 Passing out in order to give prophetic words, but I would probably need some training. Yeah, I would throw that out and run away from it
 Got another email they handle this one. This is from Annie
 She asks about<br/>
 contending for your healing versus receiving him we see this sometimes when you pray for somebody and they get
 healed and all their pain goes but then the very next day the pain that they did have that they
 were previously healed from it comes back what are your thoughts on that one Ajay?
 I don't know I don't know if I have a great answer for that I've experienced that as well I've
 experienced being healed and you're just healed and that's it and it never comes back and I've
 experience the I got healed and now it's back and then usually it goes again. I
 don't have an answer for that really. Really great. The greatest example I
 saw of that was when I was traveling with John and Carol and I remember that
 happened at a conference so we'd get one either. Well let's say it was the Friday
 night and somebody got a miraculous healing really incredible healing and
 then the Saturday night John was doing test with me. Say everybody who's got a
 test when who's got something they want to share and this lady you know who
 got healed the night before came up and John had asked her, you know, how are things going?
 And she said the pain had came back and so I was interested to hear John's answer.
 And so as John wonderfully does, he just said, well, honey, how did you get your healing?
 You know, did you strive for your healing?
 Did you fight for your feeling?<br/>
 Or did you just receive it as a free gift?
 And she said, well, I received it as a free gift.
 And he said, okay, so when I started coming back, what did you do?
 She said, "Well, I started fighting the devil."
 And he was like, "Okay, well, here's the thing.
 "You know, the devil's already defeated foe.
 "So rather than striving and fighting to keep something,
 "my encouragement would be to step back into the grace
 "that got you healed.<br/>
 "And just thank God for what he's done and ignore it."
 You know, sometimes the enemy,<br/>
 especially if it's been a spirit of affliction,
 would love to convince you<br/>
 that you're not healed and you'll do that by intimidation by lying
 and you know why you don't want to ignore genuine symptoms you also do just
 want to say you know what<br/>
 when i stop i'm a step back i'm just gonna rest in the presence in the
 goodness of god<br/>
 and choose to focus on that rather than on the
 rather than on the the pain of the healing comes back here are the symptoms
 that<br/>
 we should probably do a larger teaching on healing but that's that's what i've
 seen i've seen that i've also seen that in my own life where
 I used to be terrified of flying, which is interesting given my job used to be being on airplanes.
 And I used to suffer terribly from anxiety attacks when I'd be on a plane.
 And usually if I hadn't flown in a long time and I got on a plane,
 I would begin to feel this overwhelming dread and panic and fear.
 And I learned very quickly that actually focusing on that and I'm going to rebuke you devil and listen to that,
 and the next thing actually just got me more wound up.
 So I actually just refused to agree with it.
 focusing on the turbulence and all the things that were feeding it.
 Yeah, I would just say, you know what, God, you're very, very good.
 I refuse to come into agreement with this thing.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Now, of course, you want to balance that.
 I'm not advocating that you're genuinely having symptoms
 and you should be taking medicine and you're talking stuff out.
 That's not what I'm talking about.<br/>
 I'm talking about you've experienced some level of healing
 and you're feeling like it's coming back
 rather than, you know, going all guns blazing, fighting.
 Why not just retreat into<br/>
 Heavenly rest and see what happens. So I'm not sure it's a fully answered response
 But it's the best I can come up with as I'm driving on I-65 or actually AJ's driving
 Well, we're on 440 now, baby, and that ladies and gentlemen is why I don't drive
 Indeed and then the last question wasn't so much a question. It was a very generous offer
 From Ryan who noticed hey, I love listening to your podcast
 But what I've noticed is you don't have any bumper music and he very kindly offered to produce them for us
 Which we really appreciate Ryan, but actually we decided very deliberately not to have bumper music of the podcast
 I like to listen to I like just listening straight in I
 Don't want to bore you by making you listen to the same 15 second jingle
 At the start in the end so thank you for your kind offer, but are
 Not having it isn't because we didn't have any it's because we didn't want one then one one boom
 Well, aj Jones. I wanted to ask you about
 Given that we're gonna be speaking several times this weekend at the more conference. I
 Thought might be interesting to ask you how you
 Prepare a message how you come up with a message. What's your process for doing that?
 um I<br/>
 Would say my process is<br/>
 Always fairly similar but doesn't always look exactly the same but for this past week
 You know obviously we've known that we're gonna be speaking this weekend for a couple of months
 So I'm kind of keeping my ear to the ground with the Holy Spirit as it were and just sort of saying okay
 God, you know, what do you want me to talk about and?
 And sort of collecting thoughts and I typically just collect them all on my iPhone
 So I've been getting little pieces of revelation that are all gonna go with what I'm speaking on for the opening session
 And I've just sort of collected those and then this morning
 I took all those and started flashing it out further by mind mapping and
 Searching scripture and all that kind of stuff so
 I started there. Yeah, and then you stick stuff to the scaffolding to see how it fits
 Yeah, and then I move it around until I'm happy with sort of the mind map and the way it's organized
 and I'm confident that people will be able to follow that and then I'm going to move it to keynote and start putting that together.
 How much of it would you say you have of the finished product when you sit down to start flashing it out?
 I had three lines and a thought.<br/>
 Three lines and a thought.<br/>
 And then you find stuff comes as you give yourself to it?
 Yeah, yeah, just as I start to look through scripture and just talk to the Holy Spirit about those three lines and
 Actually, even as I'm typing the mind map stuff just starts coming
 And then how do you get from that to what you're you're standing up in front of a couple hundred people?
 Talk to me about the difference between or the steps between fleshing out and then the actual finished product then what happened?
 Well, so once I've done the mind map and I have all the scripture verses together that I'm gonna use
 I I place everything in an order and then I start putting a keynote together and
 You know writing out full notes and stuff like that in the presenters notes
 Section of it so start you know start by getting it down there once I've got it into a keynote
 I dumped the mind map and all the other tertiary notes because I don't use them anymore, right?
 And then you hand it over to your husband.
 I do.<br/>
 And you say make this look pretty.<br/>
 Make this look pretty.<br/>
 Make this look sexy.<br/>
 What's your look sexy?<br/>
 It looks audience appropriate.<br/>
 I usually do the keynote.<br/>
 I do the amount of slides I want and I type out what I want on it.
 But I hand it over to you to make it the right size and automate it and put in pictures and
 you know all that kind of stuff.<br/>
 you make it look great. I was funny to me is you used to hate using you never
 wanted to teach using keynote. Now I don't really see you teach without it.
 Well right because I understand the visuals really important for people
 actually learning and retaining. But was it hard for you to overcome speaking
 without visual aids to speaking with visual aids because a lot of speakers
 that I meet are like I don't want to do that because then I can't add live or
 freestyle. It is harder to add lib or freestyle on something. So typically if I'm doing something
 like teaching on the father heart, I will use like skeleton slides and only use the
 slides that I need for a certain scripture. And that's my encouragement. Use landmark
 slides that you don't actually have to navigate through linearly. Right. So they're broad enough
 that you could jump around and skip some stuff. I like, I actually like the structure
 of having slides because I totally agree it does limit you in jumping around.
 But actually the process of having to think through what you're actually going to speak
 and refine and be deliberate for me I end up producing better material than if I leave
 it really really broad and loosey and I'm going to add a little bit.
 But I wonder if that's just personality type that's more the way the Holy Spirit and I
 tend to work.<br/>
 Yeah, I would say I probably still prefer to just do the ad living stuff.
 Right. On the topic of Keynote, Apple has a new version, well they've had a new version out for a while,
 but finally got to the place where it's a version I would actually use and do use now in real life.
 I've been using Keynote since version 1, so the very first version came out.
 And I actually really liked a new version.
 It's a little bit more limiting in the speaker/presenter view.
 Yeah, I don't like that part. I liked the presenter view of the last
 Where you could totally customize it. Mm-hmm. I've just gotten used to it and and trust it a little more
 I'm very similar in the way. I do my notes in fact
 I wrote an article on our website Alan I do dot com if you go to articles as a
 The very first thing I wrote there is how I prepare a sermon, but I'm very very much the same
 I feel like the week that I know I'm speaking
 I feel like I'm Velcro and I just kind of wander around and I collect bits of stuff
 And just kind of pick it off me on this revelation
 And when I actually come down to sit down and look through it. I then have a
 Collection of stuff that I've collected I get tons of revelation in the shower. I
 Get revelation while I'm driving you do yeah, yeah, I get in the shower and think oh that's good and yeah, usually my
 Procedures very similar. I just sit down
 I dump it out of my brain and then I arrange it in Keynote to try and make some sort of sense of it.
 And I did spend an inordinate amount of time, if I have the luxury of the time,
 revisiting my notes a lot because I actually find the creative part of
 adding photos and finding videos really really helpful.
 It's like my brain and the Holy Spirit work together and other stuff while my brain and my hands put together images and
 a line fonts and that sort of stuff.<br/>
 Thanks for your feedback on that one. I appreciate it. You're a great co-host. I get you. Yes,
 that is what happens for you. And then you stand up and I love what Conan O'Brien says
 that you prepare like crazy so that you can wing it. And so, you know, when I get up, I'm
 confident that I know what I'm going to say, but I'm always surprised by what comes out.
 That's sometimes why we get a recording of what we've spoken on because we're like,
 Oh my gosh, Lord, you gave me some revelation there that was amazing.
 Well, hopefully that will be the case for us this weekend.
 I'm aware that we record these podcasts on a Thursday and they don't come out until
 a Monday.<br/>
 So by the time you listen to this, we will have already spoken at the more conference
 and hopefully we will have done as well as we are planning on doing.
