<p> I live in a j's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Hey baby.<br/>
 Hello, Mrs. Jones.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 I'm I had a fun day today.<br/>
 You did?<br/>
 Well, I especially liked we met somebody from Tulsa who came up and said,
 I listen to your podcast and it's thinking about doing the school.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Do you remember his name?<br/>
 Micah, Micah, Micah.<br/>
 And he was here with JJ James and Jordan.
 Look at you with all the name.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 I don't think I met all of them.<br/>
 I only met two of them.<br/>
 You met Micah and Jordan.<br/>
 Yeah, and that was cool.<br/>
 And then I'm walking on the corridor and I meet somebody from Brazil and or Mexico.
 I can't remember which one.<br/>
 Mexico.<br/>
 She's a missionary in Mexico.<br/>
 Her name was Terry.<br/>
 And she says, I listen, your podcast all the time, such an encouragement.
 This is amazing.<br/>
 I mean, real life people.<br/>
 Come on.<br/>
 So that was an exciting little event for me today.
 That was very fun, wasn't it?<br/>
 Tell me about this week.<br/>
 We had, of course, a friend here this week that we'll talk about in a few minutes.
 Yes.<br/>
 And I got the proof copy of my new book in this week.
 Yes, you did.<br/>
 Tell us about your new book.<br/>
 The new book is a children's book.<br/>
 It's an illustrated book and it's called a boy named Ben.
 I looked through the book and the illustrations were beautiful.
 Who was your incredible illustrator?<br/>
 I was my incredible illustrator.<br/>
 Give us a synopsis of a boy named Ben.
 Well, it's based on our friend Ben Farley, who went home to be with Jesus about a year and a half ago now.
 And it's the story of a little boy who realizes that God is still speaking and that God wants to use him to heal others and to make other people's lives better and how he walks that out.
 Where did you get the idea for doing the book?
 It actually, I wasn't planning on doing a book.
 And then during worship, about a week after he died, I was just
 lying there during worship.<br/>
 And I heard there once was a boy named Ben.
 And I was like, yeah, there was.<br/>
 And I cried.<br/>
 And then I heard it again.<br/>
 And I was like, OK.<br/>
 And then the third time I was like, Lord, what are you doing?
 And he said, write it down.<br/>
 So I wrote it down and he gave me the like the rest of the book.
 So I got six lines sitting there on Sunday morning.
 And then the next morning, as I was driving in the car,
 I started hearing that voice again, you know,
 just like this thought, like mid-story.
 So I opened Voice Recorder and I just repeated everything I heard.
 And when I went in, I wrote it out and it's a book.
 And so how did you go from writing the book
 to illustrating the book?<br/>
 Well, I literally that morning put together the two notes
 and was like, wow, add a sentence.<br/>
 And this is a book, you know, so like a children's book, you know.
 And so I was sitting there and I was thinking, gosh, I know people that are great
 artists.<br/>
 I guess I'll text a few people and see if they want to illustrate it for me.
 And the Lord said, why don't you illustrate it?
 And I was like, well, the main reasons would be because I've never done that before.
 I don't draw cartoons and that terrifies me.
 And so we had a little discussion about that.
 And so I basically said, well, Lord, I'll try and draw a cartoon version of Ben.
 And if I can do it, then I'll try and illustrate it myself.
 But if I can't do it, can I please ask somebody else to do it?
 And so he was like, of course.<br/>
 So I went in, I drew him that day and I liked what he looked like.
 So we took it from there and literally every page was a Lord.
 What needs to be on this page because I'm, I have no idea how to do this.
 And he would give me a picture.<br/>
 I'm being the little nerd that I am.<br/>
 I love that you did it all on your iPad.
 Did it all on my iPad?<br/>
 It was before you had the iPad pro with the Apple pencil.
 Oh, I can't imagine how much easier it would have been with the iPad pro and the Apple pencil.
 Like it probably would have taken me a third or a quarter of the time.
 So you did it all on an iPad mini.<br/>
 I've had many with a big thick.<br/>
 What are those things called?<br/>
 53 pencil.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 In the procreate app in the pro.<br/>
 I love the procreate app.<br/>
 It's it's my favorite creative app.<br/>
 But I'm so proud of you because you'd never done anything like that before.
 And you hadn't been using procreate and you learn all about layers and this
 and that and the next thing and all trial and error.
 I mean, you did an incredible job.<br/>
 I really think they're incredible.<br/>
 And I'm not just saying that because I married to you.
 They are brilliant children's illustrations.
 Thank you. I'm really pleased with the way it turned out. And when we got the proof copy in,
 I was the weight of the paper and the cover and the feel of it is all gorgeous. We just found a
 couple spelling mistakes that needed to be fixed. And so I get the proof proof tomorrow of the
 supposedly fixed up perfect one. Right. And you made the the slide for path posting that to
 social media, I would find everyone to know where you can get copies. Yes. But they're not available
 for sale yet. They're not yet but they will be shortly but what we thought was we would put a
 page on alanaj.com and if you put alanaj.com/ben and if you want to go check that out it will let
 you know more information and if you want to be notified when it becomes available to be purchased
 you can also just put your email address in there and we will let you know so we're super stoked.
 We really are. I can't wait to get it into the hands of parents. I think parents are going to
 have a great time reading it to their kids. It is really cute.
 I had a very strange experience this week teaching. You did?
 Yeah, well, I was teaching on joy. Yes.
 And I don't want to give too much about this away because I think in the next couple of episodes,
 we'll talk about it because it was fascinating for me to teach on this because I learned a bunch
 of stuff I didn't know and was kind of really challenged by my own teaching, which is really
 the best kind of teaching. But it was one of the craziest weeks for us leading up to it.
 It was a few listened to last week's episode. You would have heard about the plague that
 hit the Jones household. So we got no sleep, no rest. All of our time was spent mopping
 and falling. And then I had to go in and teach a brand new series of teaching, which was my own idea.
 But I was probably at my weakest I've ever been as a teacher in terms of feeling confident about
 my material in terms of preparation. And yeah, in the middle of my weakness, the the Lord really
 showed up. And so that was just a weird experience for me to just go in and think God, I don't even
 I've got enough material to get through an hour of this and end up speaking for two days.
 But the students said it was amazing, babe.
 So as much as you felt like you were winging it, well, that's why I totally backed you
 up.<br/>
 Yeah, I'm sure the verse about his power made perfect in our week.
 There's something about that somewhere.
 Yeah.<br/>
 But anyway, that was joy.<br/>
 We'll talk about that in the coming weeks.
 Okay.<br/>
 Speaking of joy, our daughter turns nine tomorrow.
 I can't even believe I have a nine year old tomorrow.
 I just can't believe it.<br/>
 She's so excited.<br/>
 You know, parents always say, "Oh, it goes so fast."
 You're like, "Yeah, yeah, it does.<br/>
 It goes so fast."
</p><ul>
  <li>That's an illogical statement.
 It goes at the speed of time.
 It feels like it's going really fast.
  </li><li>That's more accurate.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>But we do logic men.
  </li><li>Does it feel like that?
  </li><li>It does.
 It does.
 Dude, MJ's three and a half.
  </li><li>Wait, I'm sorry, did you just call me a dude?
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, I'm like, "Hello, our children are,
 they're practically ancient."
 Yeah, they're growing up.
 So Abigail's her first tattoo tomorrow, isn't that the rule?
 Yeah, ninth birthday.
 Eighth birthday was earrings, ninth birthday tattoos.
 I love it.
 That's perfect.
 Yeah.
 She's going to look great with the Lord's Supper on her back.
 It's yeah.
 I mean, it's going to stretch as she grows, though.
 We might want to go for something smaller.
 Yeah.
 You alluded to a friend earlier.
 I did.
 Our friend, David Campbell, is here.
 Has flown all the way from England.
 Yes, he has.
 Hi, David.
 I don't even remember the first time we met.
 I think you met AJ in '94, but we'd heard about you.
 I'd heard about you certainly from John and Carol, because you and Mandy are
 really good friends with John and Carol.
 So I'd heard about the legend that is Dave Campbell before I ever met you.
 The legend.
 So tell our listeners about yourself.
 Where do you live?
 What do you do that sort of stuff?
 Well, I live in near London, a city coast in Dolben's.
 and Alwyn was the first Christian Martin Britain. So it's one of the oldest cities in England,
 but it was well over two and a half thousand years old. And I'm a Pentecoxo minister there,
 and I minister to looking over about 140 churches and 200 pastors, and I spend my time with them,
 mostly. And forgive me for pointing out the plain the obvious, but you live in England,
 but you don't have a very English accent. Yeah. One of these folks that people were born
 of Scotland and was sent down as a missionary down south. Try and when the heathen.
 When the heathen, that's the right word.
 Yes. Well, now that we have another Scotsman in the room,
 AJ insists on doing a Scottish accent and things that she thinks are like that.
 And I would she doesn't believe me that nobody talks like that.
 Oh, I knew.
 People do talk like that, but they're all English people on holiday.
 Can you say the thing about the moonlick?
 This is the broad, brach moonlick neck.
 The neck to say that your arctic and.
 And what does any of that mean?
 It's a beautiful moonlit evening this evening.
 If you can say that, you're all right to know.
 So it's a proper moonlick neck.
 Oh my gosh.
 So you started out life as a past.
 A past.
 You started out life as an accountant, didn't you?
 I did. I was identical twin brother and we both started off as accountants and he diversified
 into computers and I went off into the ministry. How does one go from looking after one church
 to looking after 140 churches? I often wonder how I was talking to that.
 I loved my church and then my leader said to me, "Would you look after Moa?" and I was given,
 i think initially sixty other churches i passed my chut wait wait wait you have a huge job
 yeah i think i have a richard slowly yeah it's called a regional superintendent
 and usually they were full time and i didn't ever want to give up local church.
 So i said if i can do that i can keep the local church i'll do it so then let me do that
 let me do two jobs and then we change our structure and i was given 130 churches but we've planted 10
 So there's 140 churches now.
 So growing and growing those have a few more on the way now.
 You oversee 140 churches, about 200 pastors.
 You really are a pastor to pastor and a leader to leaders.
 How long have you been a leader, a pastor?
 Well, I've been a pastor for over 30 years, but 38 years now.
 Goodness me.
 Wow.
 I started really young, you know.
 Like four.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I would be old, I was sick a lot as a child, so I just, I just, I've been in all my life
 really, and I started young.
 And you helped lead the Elam Pentecostal Church, it's not just the 140 overseas, but you're
 on the leadership team of the whole nation that oversees all the Elam Pentecostal Church.
 Yeah, I'm one of the national leaders, and there's 11 of us.
 But Elam, we are active in 40 different nations, and we really take the great commission seriously,
 going to all the world. So we're in 40 different nations. We oversee that. That's amazing. Good night.
 And how come there's not Elon churches in America? Well, fun. If we don't really see it as a
 mission field, we think, I think the American church is quite strong and should do that. So
 we have relationship, we've been most like the four square church in our structure and beliefs.
 And so at Elon's proper name is the Elon four square gospel lines. And in fact, the guy who
 started the Elon Musk, George Jeffries. And when Amy sent for McPherson, I don't know
 what this should be. She disappeared for a little while.
 Yes, she did. Yeah.
 And the elders at Angeles Temple asked George Jeffries to come and take over.
 Well, they figured out.
 Sort it out. But he was too busy, I don't know,
 revive on the UK, so he didn't come. But we were close. That's
 the Elon Musk 100 years old now. Wow.
 been going a while. Tell me the difference between a Pentecostal and a charismatic.
 I think the Pentecostals take the roots right back to Zuzu Street and times like that really.
 For this kind of Martis really came out with the 60s and 70s outpouring and would mainly have
 come out of the mainstream denominations. For us the Anglicans, the Baptist, the Methodist,
 they became kind of Martics. That would be the main difference. We'd have that history of 100
 years. I've been around really. Of course you would. I hadn't thought of that.
 You as well as being a leader of these churches, a leader of this movement, you also run River
 Camp. Tell us about River Camp because you know my great affection for camping, but this
 sounds like something. And by great affection he means rather being a hotel.
 Wonderful. But tell me about it and tell me how it started. I started off really because
 A few of us realized that it's really hard to get a family blasted by the Holy Spirit
 at the same time, really.
 And to take your kids off school to go to the other Christian things wasn't working for
 us.
 So what we did, we said, wouldn't it be great if we could all go away for a weekend, a long
 weekend and get your children ministered to and get everyone.
 So we just did it, it was two or three hundred people.
 In fact, they limited the number to three hundred and said, "Well, run it like that's
 five hundred."
 thought if it's a total disaster, but all our friends come and then we don't have to
 apologize to anyone. That's good thinking.
 It was great. I was just amazing. I think we're in our 14th year now. We're averaging
 out now, but 2,000 people. We go for six days now. It's just a place of folks that
 love the river, that love the father's hearts, and we just want people to connect with God
 and be transformed. That's what we do really. That's our value. Father's heart and freedom
 and the Holy Spirit.
 And when does it happen this year and where does it happen?
 It's always the last weekend in August. I may run from the Wednesday through to the
 Monday of the bank in England, the bank holding the Monday. I think it's Labour Day over here.
 And people literally camp out and then you've got stuff on site for them to do.
 Well, we've got about 2,000 people, 1,400 or 1,500 people camp. And then probably up to
 not 800 people because not everyone comes the whole time, but they've been hotels. I used
 to be in a tent, but I feel now God's call me to look after the speakers and so I stay
 in a hotel. That's probably smart. And that's a lot nicer really. It's great to have a bath
 or a shower or something. Those are nice things to have. Yeah, we have all those things out at
 the camp, but it's nice to not have to queue outside waiting for one. And you've had some amazing
 speakers in the 14 years that you've been going. Todd, what are some of the people you've had?
 Well, that friends of River Count me, John and Kyle are not, and they're special friends to
 us really. If John is the country, he just has an open invitation to come and he's a father of
 what's been happening really with the father heart. Heidi Baker is another one who comes.
 In fact, the revival of lying speakers would be the ones who would just come. We've just built a
 relationship with Jesus culture now and they're coming to be part of that. And so, Eric Johnson
 coming this year from Bethel in Reading and that she has shown books. It's coming to do a
 prophetic time. So, it's really amazing. Do you still have tickets open? Like if our listeners
 in the UK want to come, is it still tickets? Oh, you just turn up and we'll let you in really.
 Okay. We'll take anybody's money.
 But our real heart is actually we break even and we take an offering every year and we give it away.
 We just love to give money away to people and that's the real blessing really.
 Yeah, that sounds amazing, David. That really does. I'm thrilled to hear that in the UK,
 this was 2,000 hungry people in the presence of God. I'll be in the countryside, but I'll look
 over that for a second. It's amazing that you're pioneering that. One of the other things that
 that you do on top of that is you run a leaders conference for, I guess, all your leaders.
 Yeah, well, I wanted to try and get, reach everything because we have a, if the families
 come together, I like to do things for the leaders at different times of the year. So
 our plan is to build a nine-year-old leaders meeting. So we built Johnson, came and did
 our last one and we have about a thousand leaders come together. We're talking to build
 high books to come in next one. So it's completely different to build John's.
 Right. And Brian Houston from Hell Songs were the ones that we've hoping to get at the moment just to
 clip the body because we were really looking for a revival. I'm a bit of a revivalist. I love the move the Holy Spirit. I love renewal, but
 we really need a revival and I believe in the expo of God's got souls attached to it and some really keen to see that happen.
 Okay, so here's a fun one for you.
 Who have been some of your heroes or inspirations?
 I mean, there's one in the UK and one in Canada, really.
 I think there has been no surprise to you,
 Ray John Arnold is my hero.
 I think he's just amazing because not just because God used him in Toronto
 and something that affected the whole world,
 but I've got to know John and Carol away from the platform.
 And I think my goodness, if ever there's somebody like Jesus is John.
 Oh, I totally agree.
 It's so like, I mean, it just doesn't,
 I know I've seen patient with people.
 I think he gives time to people that really they don't, they shouldn't have really.
 And he just gives off himself and it just doesn't take himself seriously.
 He gets, it's just wonderful.
 He is a really example to me.
 I love his preaching.
 He's so biblical the way talks and all that sort of stuff.
 And he would be that.
 And then you came by man who's got me with the Lord recently, he's got
 when Lewis and he mentored me. He was an out-of-the-nomination. I was our leader, but he took
 Kensington Temple from 500 to 5000. He was our first mega church and he was just a great
 inspiration. So those two men pretty much had ready.
 I remember the first time a friend of mine, Laura Woodley, met John and she met him and then I was
 talking to her afterwards and she said, "AJ, I felt like when I was looking in his eyes, I was just
 looking in the eyes of love. And she said, I think that must be what it's like to look
 at the face of Jesus. And I was like, yep, you know,
 Yeah, I think you're right. Yeah. What brings you joy as a leader?
 The greatest joy I get is somebody reaching their potential. I think that that really
 in the sense, I think leaders are there to equip the saints to do the work of service.
 Right. And when you see someone who maybe didn't believe themselves or didn't know they were
 good at something. And I love it particularly if people become better at something than
 I am. I just I really love it. I find someone who's become really good at something I think
 that it's so good to see them fulfilled in doing something. So a lot of my time is just
 making things possible for people to do things and to reach the potential. I love it when somebody
 reaches their potential and especially if it surprises them. They do say that behind every
 successful man is a surprise mother-in-law. I think sometimes I look at people that think
 sometimes their wife's surprised, they're surprised and I think we don't know what we've got. It's
 a little boy with five looks and two fish. He didn't know what he had until he started to give it away.
 We don't know what we've got until we give it away and I like to provide an atmosphere that's
 that's conducive to people giving away what they've got
 so they realize how much they've really got.
  </li><li>Would you also say that,
 I'm just thinking while you're saying that,
 the flip side of that is probably one of the hardest things
 as a leader is to watch people not actually meet
 their potential, to walk away from what they actually
 could have walked towards and seen a fullness.
  </li><li>Heartbreaking. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Totally heartbreaking.
 When you see people just throw their lives away
 and just for all sorts of strange reasons,
 It's almost like they're seeking some sort of recognition for something they're not
 rather than receiving the commendation of the father for what they are.
 Why people you're not, when God's really pleased with what you are.
 I guess I've seen a few people shipwreck their faith and people lose their marriages, lose
 their kids, because of immorality and you think, "That's so sad you didn't need to
 do that."
 What would you say, I'm interested to be in your situation where I'm not saying you've
 seen everything but you've seen a lot.
 You've seen the good, the bad, the ugly, the inside, the behind the scenes of leadership
 and Christian leaders.
 What would you say to emerging Christian leaders?
 They've got a call, they recognize that they're stepping out.
 What would you say are the biggest mistakes you see leaders make early on in their careers
 as they're stepping out to just lead.
  </li><li>Well, I think one of the biggest things is the,
 everyone seems to out to impress somebody
 and they're worried what people are thinking.
 I think somebody said once,
 we wouldn't worry half as much about what people are thinking
 about as if a new house sound them they did.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And most people aren't watching you have the moment of the day
 and thinking, are they doing this?
 Are you doing right?
 And really the only person that really worries
 is what does Jesus think about me today?
  </li><li>Right.
 please in him because and the end of the day that's the one that works really so I think I almost
 sit here and pass it just be yourself that be fine and I and and because God's called you to be
 you and and if God wanted you to be somebody else that somebody else you keep thinking about
 don't you think God could have arranged that right right you don't think like the angel went to heaven
 and said he's been born such and such and the Lord went oh no there's supposed to be somebody else
 Right. You're meant to be who you are. You are the best you you could ever be. There's no one who could do you better than you.
 Right. And so just going to be the best you and that will be enough. That'll be fine.
 And I think that's one of the things that you embody really, really well. As do John, in fact, when I think about my,
 my favorite speaker is the most influential people that I know. There are people who are comfortable in their own shoes.
 Yeah. It's so much easier that way, isn't it?
 And if you're a lazy person, trust me, that's the way to be.
 And I just think, how could people just spend all their life trying to live a line, be something
 else? It's so much easier just to be yourself. And that doesn't mean you excuse your weaknesses,
 it means you accept yourself through weaknesses, you work on them. And I actually quite like myself
 in a nice sort of way, you know, I've accepted who I am. And that was a tunneling the colonial day
 for me. I think this is what I am and it's not that great but it's the best I've got.
 I have be the best me. I think because I'm an identical twin, a lot of people don't know
 who I am. A lot of people have caught me the wrong name but I've always known who I was
 and I just want to be me and I'm happy being me. I don't want to be somebody else.
 What are some of the things that you look for when you're picking leaders? Is there a
 process that you go through in your thinking and and what are some of the character attributes
 that you're looking for? I mean obviously devotion to Christ but what are some of the things that
 you are looking for and what are some of the deal breakers for you? I look for transparency really
 that's one of the biggest things is this person real right if you're transparent then people can
 See, it's like somebody said intimacy is in to me you see.
 And that's what if someone's intimate with you,
 you can see into them.
 And I look for that.
 I look for people who want to be real.
 Right.
 And I think if you're a leader,
 people will forgive you anything if they think you're genuine.
 If you love the people,
 they will almost cope with every other fault you've got.
 So long as they know you love them, you care for them
 and you're not abusing them,
 you're trying to do your best. So I look, who's genuine? I have this little thing about,
 do you want prominence or do you want influence? Do you? Some people want position.
 Right. And they need everyone to know, I did that. I did that. I did that. And they want the
 the commendation, they want the applause. And sometimes they'll take credit for things they
 didn't do because how you think of them is very important to them. Right. And there's other people
 just want influence. I think this needs to be done. And if somebody else gets a credit for it,
 it didn't really matter because it's more important it gets done. So I look for people
 who seek to have influence and not prominence. And I'll promote those people.
 Well, major deal breakers? Dishonesty. I think when somebody lies in one area of
 their life, they'll probably lie in others. And I think everyone can make a mistake.
 Emma makes two mistakes of three months. When she starts seeing a trend, we have a character problem.
 I think if somebody is dishonest, there will be dishonest, but all sorts of areas. If you lie a bit
 money, they're probably lying to their wife. It's almost like it becomes a gross. It's like a weed.
 Right. You don't find one weed in a garden.
 Need that long enough and you'll have a garden full of weeds and things like that.
 So if somebody's dishonest, it will come into other areas of their life.
 Yeah.
 You were telling the year two students the story about the Japanese thief.
 Yeah.
 Could you tell that story?
 Because I actually think there's so much life on that and it's got a great message.
 I don't know if it's a true story.
 I was told it's a true story.
 But if it's not, it should be.
 And it's a story told of a Japanese boy in the turn of last century, so that's the
 1900s and his parents both died and he was left on his own and they didn't have any
 family to laugh to him. So he ended up stealing food. I guess I guess stealing is wrong whenever
 but if he'd been in our street he wouldn't know how to steal food. We would have fed
 him or brought him to our house but he stole food and he found out he was good at stealing
 and he could break into people's houses and steal things and then he, I guess, like anybody
 else, once you keep bad company and you become bad company, he became such bad company,
 the bad company was scared of him.
 Right.
 And the ladies living, breaking into people's houses.
 And one day the little old lady in a Saturday night met him in the street and told him about
 Jesus.
 And he never had the gospel before.
 And to hear about God, I loved him and accepted him, just blew him away.
 And the whole spirit had convicted him.
 And she led him to Christ and he got saved.
 And then she said, I've potted up at him and your little old ladies can be quite scary
 and the sudden she said, no, your man, you have to go to church tomorrow.
 The oral promised me you'll go to church.
 They said, yeah, well, it's a promise me you have got church tomorrow.
 You know what a church is like, don't you?
 And he'd been on the roof of churches if you don't understand what I mean, right?
 Probably taking lead away.
 And they said, yes, I know.
 I know where there's a church.
 Yes, yes, yes.
 So he went to church the next day and he found a church and if I can give you a quick version of this
 He's sitting there and he's very uncomfortable because he's a thief and he what sees people
 He actually saw a family coming in thinking I recognize you and they thought oh no, I've been in your house
 Probably when they went in and now and he saw policemen arrive and other people and he's sitting at the bike and
 Like many visits to church. He didn't know any of the songs. He knew nothing about it
 Right. And so, once I sat saying, you could read, but he wasn't that great at it. And he's looking
 around. And it's an old fashioned church with a steeple outside and stained glass windows.
 And in olden days, they'd have stained glass windows that told stories that maybe the parables
 of Jesus or something. And the minister would point to different whenever we can tell stories.
 That's how people thought Bibles learnt things. And this church had the 10 commandments around
 on the outside. And as he was sitting there, just feeling uncomfortable, the sun shone
 through and on his face and he felt the warmth of it, he turned and I think he already guessed
 that one of the 10 Commandments was lit up as he turned and looked at it and the one
 that was lit up was said, "Thou shalt not steal." How did he feel? Probably felt really bad,
 I actually know he looked at that and said, "Wow, God says I'll never steal again."
 It's he hadn't heard of the Ten Commandments and he thought this is a promise from God.
 And he felt that God says, "No, you won't steal."
 And I think that when you become a Christian, you still keep the Ten Commandments.
 But instead of being commandments, you become Ten Promises.
 You won't commit adultery.
 You won't because I'll give you a love for your spouse.
 You won't steal.
 That was shout-not still. You won't steal because I will be the Lord your provider.
 You won't use the name of the Lord and vane. Why? Because you'll love that name.
 And you could go through the whole 10 commandments, one with that, after another.
 And instead of being a commandment, it becomes a promise to you.
 I won't be doing that because I'm a child now. And his commands have become promises.
 I love that. So good.
 When you were here at the more conference, you told one of the most amazing stories
 When you were here at the more conference, you told such an incredible story.
 The only thing I remember was it was a sign and a wonder and it involved a paramedic.
 Do you know the story I'm talking about?
 I do know.
 Can you tell that story because I loved it?
 Well, that paramedic was my daughter.
 Oh, so you're intimately coincident.
 I mean, Amy was in our final training to be a paramedic.
 So she's on her last day and in the paramedic drives an ambulance, but you're almost like
 a doctor, they're quite highly trained. And she had to be signed off by this chief
 paramedic officer in London, ticked off, she did so many things and did the right.
 So it's a day when her partner isn't just another paramedic, but one of the top people
 in the country really. And she phoned me up and she said, "Dad, I've just seen a miracle."
 And I said, "Well, tell me about it." And she'd be called out to a house in Hampstead,
 London. And her lady, and there had an accident,
 in the hamster London is a place where you would not buy a house for less than 3 or 4
 million pounds, right, $6 million, because rich people. But this lady was an Nigerian
 lady and her friend had come to stay and she'd fallen down the stairs and broken her leg.
 And when they got inside, this lady's speaking tongues very loudly over her, saying that
 there was a liar, there was a liar. And when they got in the founder lady, I hadn't just
 broken on the egg, that I had to put the colon open fracture, which means you've
 broke your leg and the bone is sticking out through the skin and into the fresh
 air, which is really dangerous and it's extremely painful. And so they're rushing
 to help on it. But the lady of the house is shouting in tongues and an Amy's
 looking at the bar box really saying, are you all right with this? And he says,
 it's a bit strange, isn't it? And they said, I know what this says, but
 died does this. And so they get that to go to the ambulance and they bring in a special
 splint thing which they put around the leg and then it, they inflate it and it goes really
 hard. It doesn't fix the leg, it just stops it moving anymore and then strap it to the
 other one and they put the lady on a stretcher and took her to the ambulance. And all the
 time that her host is shouting in tongues loudly. And when they get to the ambulance,
 Amy said to her boss, "Do you want to drive?"
 And now I'm going to back and he said, "Yes, please."
 And so he gets in the front and he has to raid over head
 and say, "I've got a lady with an open fracture.
 "We need to have a theater open immediately.
 "We need to have a need to test.
 "We need everybody there.
 "We're bringing this lady in."
 And London is a pretty busy place.
 I know America have a lot of cars,
 but we've got a lot of cars and not a lot of space in London.
 Oh, it's crazy.
 So they're going with the ambulance, they're flashing red and blue lights going, the blue
 lights going, and the sirens going, and all the cars are going out the way.
 They have to go right across London to the Royal Free Hospital.
 And when they get there, they're met by the staff.
 They've got the theatre ready, the whole theatre, everybody's ready, on standby.
 And this lady still speaks in tongues all the way there.
 And they have to say to you have to stay here because you're not family.
 You have to, you know, you're not allowed past this point.
 And when they got inside and some of you probably guessed what's happened next, but
 I'm still going to finish the story.
 When they, when they get inside and they all gathered round and they took the sprint off,
 the lady's leg was totally healed.
 Wow.
 Totally healed.
 And like, that means the bone wasn't sticking out the leg.
 But more than that, there was no scarve where it had been sticking out her leg.
 And later on when they x-rayed her, they couldn't see a crack in the bone.
 I said, "What, do you have to realize that actually in London, you can't just stick
 your lights on and go across London with your sire and you have to get permission to do
 that.
 You have to get all the traffic moving the way you get the police to help you."
 And this senior paramedic in London has just done that.
 And he's sent to the doctors.
 I promise you, I promise you, she presented with this.
 She did this.
 She definitely had an open fracture.
 This is the way it was.
 But the thing that got me, I asked Amy, I said,
 so what did the doctor say?
 I know the doctor just looked at her and said,
 shocked his shoulders and said, it happens.
  </li><li>Wow. - It happens.
 And ever so often they get somebody brought in
 who has a life-threatening condition
 who by the time they get the hospital, God has healed them.
  </li><li>Wow. - And they think,
 Wow, that was incredible.
 That is such an encouraging story
 because we often think, and we've had people
 on the podcast, you know, we've had surprise on here.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Talking about miracles, and we tend to relegate that to either,
 if you're a cynical Christian, you think,
 well, of course God does that in the third world nations.
  </li><li>Because they don't have medical.
  </li><li>If you're just a cynical period, you're just like,
 well, they're uneducated, they don't,
 they were confused about the diagnosis.
 But here is a senior paramedic whose job reputation,
 everything on the line.
 Here is an ER doctor.
 And yeah, both of them were like, yeah, well,
 that happens, we've seen that.
  </li><li>It's great, 'cause it's funny that the secret,
 the prequel to that was just before I'd been saying
 to my wife, I'd love to have a story
 that people didn't believe, you know,
 'cause I hear stories that people don't believe
 and I think I'd love to have a story like that.
 And I, and we're saying to the students,
 I'm praying that you all have a story this week.
 right, that people don't believe, you know, almost when people say it's too good to be
 true.
 Right.
 I want to be able to say, I say, no, it's actually so good it could only have been God.
 Right.
 And that story is not too good to be true.
 It's actually so good it could only have been God.
 Yeah.
 So I either would tell them big black lies or that was a miracle.
 And it's not just too good to be true.
 It's so good it could only have been God.
 As we wrap this up, share with our listeners three things that would help them grow in
 their relationship with Jesus.
 If you could leave them with three things like, guys, somebody who's been in ministry,
 30 plus years, who has given their life to raising other leaders, here's what I would
 encourage you to do, just three things that you could practically do today.
 I think someone would really just obvious things like, actually read your Bible.
 Right, yeah.
 to read this. People say things, read the Bible, but actually people don't do it much,
 really. They say the Bible is the most bought book in the world. I'm not sure it's the best
 read book in the world. I read it and I should enjoy it and let God speak to you and fill
 yourself with that. But also find out where is it you usually hear from God? I asked groups
 of pastors this to say, "When is the last time God really, really spoke with you?"
 I mean, it's a normally happening.
 And I'd love to say it's when I'm preaching
 that most people have.
 But I see it's very seldom during the sermon
 that people really hear from God a changing word.
 But a lot of people it's maybe in a large worship gathering
 or it's listening to music somewhere
 or looking at a sunset or looking at a seaside or book.
 And I just would say, so when is it God often speaks to you?
 Is it a pattern?
 And if there is, when is that next in your diary?
 Oh, because often people say, I know when God normally speaks to me and says, so do you
 have that in your diary?
 No, so you're not expecting God, you're not planning for it.
 You can't make God speak, but you can make space for Him to speak.
 So find out where it is and how it is in only speaks to you and makes space for that.
 And I think one of the best things to keep you close to Jesus is witness to somebody every
 day.
 Because there's nothing like Jesus had going to all the world and preach the gospel
 And lo I'll be with you. So if you really want to be aware of his presence
 Witness to somebody and of course that that's sort of lens so three point a
 It's to say that also that you need to spend realize you spend and all your life in his presence and just
 Enjoy his presence. Yeah, David. Thank you so much for coming and being on the podcast and just
 sharing your wisdom and sharing your heart and of course thank you for impacting our school.
 I'm just wondering if you would mind praying for all of our listeners before we close out this
 evening. Yeah, I'd love to do that. Father, I thank you. You have such a wonderful plan for our lives.
 You're such destiny. I just want to speak to you as we're praying and to say, listen,
 your history does not determine your destiny. Your God holds your destiny. I pray, Father,
 that you'd release destiny all over.
 Every one of us, I'll just pray for every listener
 that we might reach the destiny you've called us to,
 that you've placed us on this earth for a purpose.
 And then that purpose is all wrapped up in your love,
 that we might be a people who know your love
 and who are set free by that love.
 But let us be so blessed
 that we become a blessing to others.
 Let us so know your love,
 that we are able to shed your love abroad.
 Let us be so secure in you,
 that we can shout your name from the rooftops.
 'Cause you're a great and wonderful God.
 So I just speak blessing over you as you listen,
 that God will bless you and everything you do.
 Every place you go today,
 will be just a little bit different
 because the fragrance of Jesus is with you,
 but you will change the atmosphere of everywhere you go
 because you're taking the presence of Jesus with you.
 God bless you in Jesus name.
 Amen.
  </li><li>Well, thank you to David for being here
 and for spending some time answering our questions
 I'm praying for everybody.

 because nobody's actually told me how you pronounce it.
 But I think it's pronounced Chikamaga.
 Chikamaga.
 Chikamaga.
 Well, there's no "an."
 Chikamuga, Chikamaga.
 Chikamaga.
 Chikamaga.
