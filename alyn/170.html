<p> I live in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to episode one seventy of keeping up with the jones is this week we're actually having a lighter week before we get on to the lightness.
 The airy fairy lightness that is to come.
 Let's do a weekly catch up.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 The great national nightmare and debate is over.
 The results are in.<br/>
 It is pronounced apricot, not apricot.
 At what percentage did that come in at?
 Because I spoke to two people yesterday who said they didn't vote
 because they thought I had secured apricot.
 Okay.<br/>
 Well, two people is not statistically valid number.
 It was a landslide victory.<br/>
 It was something like a hundred percent.
 No, it was not.<br/>
 It was not.<br/>
 You said that.<br/>
 You said it was 100% and then I went and checked and it was like 59 to 41.
 And I was like, babe, that's not 100% and you said, well, I don't know when that happened.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Last time I looked before it came down because I forgot it's Instagram stories.
 I thought I'd take a screenshot, but the last time I looked, it was a 60 40 split,
 60% of people educated enough to know that apricots pronounced apricot.
 The other 40% I don't know, hippies, but I'm so sorry.
 But at least now you know, how do you pronounce it, baby?
 I forgot all the deception run deep.<br/>
 Deep.<br/>
 And runs really deep.<br/>
 Let's try doing that one next.<br/>
 Is it that deception runs deep or the reception?
 The reception runs deep.<br/>
 Oh dear.<br/>
 You were saying too late.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 We're all messed up.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 This week, yes, there's one item on my weekly catch up.
 I'm trying not to jump to.<br/>
 OK, so I'm trying to do procedure.<br/>
 Really.<br/>
 We started the week.<br/>
 I was teaching on sexual wholeness in first year.
 You were teaching on Sunship in second year.
 Yep.<br/>
 Matt Crowstone just killed it, knocked out of the park at M&amp;A.
 It was so good.<br/>
 I laughed so hard.<br/>
 I, we, he brought his friend Harvey.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Our dear friend Harvey.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 I don't know how old Harvey is.<br/>
 I don't know either.<br/>
 But he's, he was certainly the oldest person at M&amp;A.
 Yeah, he's like 60s or 70s somewhere in there.
 And I thought Matt killed him.<br/>
 I thought Matt told the joke and I looked over just to see what Harvey would have thought.
 And I thought, are we in trouble?<br/>
 Like Harvey was doubled over.
</p><ul>
  <li>He was gonna explode.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>And I thought the man's gonna die laughing.
 This is great, but really, really bad.
 But anyway, Matt just killed it.
  </li><li>We're happy to record that Harvey is still alive.
  </li><li>I'll put a link in the show notes.
 It basically had all the elements that we want
 with like meekness, wisdom, humor, anointing,
 great storyteller.
  </li><li>So good.
  </li><li>So I'll put a link in the show notes.
 But well done, Matt.
 That was just a phenomenal job.
 All right, all that is great.
 I really enjoyed that week, but it pales
 and didn't significant with the revelation
 I had this week.
 Do you know what I'm talking about?
  </li><li>No, I don't think I do.
  </li><li>We, Edgy and I went out to have some dinner
 with our friends, Josh and Chelsea.
  </li><li>We did, yeah.
  </li><li>So we're at their house, we had a great meal,
 we're just chatting, catching up,
 having seen them in a while.
 And as we're getting to ready to leave,
 I'm just kind of wandering around their living room,
 and I noticed that they have an intent to switch.
 And I was like, "Ah, I didn't figure you guys
 for video games and they're like, oh yeah, we really love Mario Kart.
 And I was like, oh, you do do you.
 And I was like, I want to play you Mario Kart because let's face
 facts. It's not too many areas of life that I can excel compared to these guys.
 Like they're uber fit.
 They're super like outdoorsy.
 They're like workout champs.
 Yeah.
 Like just and I'm thinking I can flex my Mario Kart muscles.
 Yes.
 So now here's the thing for context.
 I'm a pretty good Mario Kart player.
 I'm by pretty good.
 I mean, I've finished every level that there is in there.
 I've raced all the Nintendo staff, etc, etc.
 I've got, you know, gold stars and everything.
 I regular play online.
 I regularly beat everybody I play.
 So I'm exceptionally confident that I.
 What you're saying is when I play against you, you're
 dumbing yourself down so that I'll play.
 Not you, darling.
 Thank you.
 You're you're amazing.
 Thank you.
 You give me a good run for my money at 50cc.
 I don't know what to do.
 Thanks, darling.
 So I'm fairly confident that this is going to be walking apart.
 We can have a quick four rounds.
 We can leave and I'll end on a high.
 And so I've got.
 Because you need to beat somebody before you leave their dinner.
 Absolutely.
 I'm I've completely forgotten Proverbs 16 verse 18 that pride goes before
 destruction and shoddyness before fall, but seriously, these guys are like.
 Crossfit junk.
 I mean, there's no way they're good at a video game, right?
 So we sit down and we begin playing.
 And I'm like, dang, I like, I am struggling to keep up.
 Now, there's a few asterisks and caveats we'll get to in a second, but credit
 where credit is due.
 Josh and Chelsea are amazing.
 I don't just mean that they're like good players.
 I mean, they handed you your butt the first round.
 I mean, these guys are heavily.
 Oh, they absolutely did.
 Yeah. Absolutely.
 They're heavily invested.
 I know this because there's people who play the game a lot.
 Then there's people who've studied all the statistics of all the characters and
 the cost benefit analysis of each of the vehicles, they knew all of that.
 I'm like, who are you?
 We drive to this and you probably need the that and maybe you should try that.
 And I'm like, Oh my God.
 No, in my defense, they hadn't unlocked all the vehicle parts.
 So they didn't have my usual setup.
 And Josh was kind enough to acknowledge that.
 I mean, he did, you know, bless me.
 He used some sports analogy about baseball, which I didn't get at all.
 But I was like, yes, yes, absolutely that.
 It's me pitch hitting a square run touchdown.
 That's exactly what's happening.
 So he let me change vehicles and I, but again, I struggle to keep up because
 good Lord, those people are are are skilled.
 So now here's the caveat.
 We were playing 150.
 I spent all my time in 200 CC.
 Yes.
 That's not really an excuse though, because I should have been able to just kill them, kill them easily.
 But the fact I couldn't.
 I mean, I went home bewildered.
 I was like, I lost my powers.
 the next morning like Samson, but somebody cut off my hair and I've lost my Nintendo
 box morning. You must have mentioned it like three times before nine o'clock. Like I still
 can't believe how good Josh and Chelsea were.
 Well, you know, you put people in boxes and you know, you shouldn't do and you think, well,
 they'll be good at this. They'll be good at that. I mean, they'll be good at half marathons
 and triathlons and Iron Man. But, you know, I've got them.
 But maybe, okay. Yeah, I'm kind of the man at Mario Kart. No, no, no. Although we did
 play around with 200 before we left and you know I regained our family dignity and
 I could see what we had to do.
 I mean otherwise the Jones family name was going to go down the tube.
 But the worrying thing is word on the street is they're now practicing at 200cc.
 That is the word on the street.
 She's scared to go back to their house for a rematch.
 So we're just going to have to off them as friends.
 No, I'm just going to play people who have less caliber Mario Kart, but I have worked
 out that we can play online.
 So I haven't sent them my credentials yet because I'm too scared to play.
 I think I need to practice a little bit more.
 Wow.
 It's nice to see this side of you, darling.
 What they, the humbled, not humble side.
 It's, it's just nice because, uh, now you know how I feel.
 You know, playing my 50 cc.
 You're adorable, adorable.
 All right.
 That is our weekly catch up.
 But wait, you forgot to mention our other Mario Kart news.
 I don't know what other Mario Kart news is.
 I prophesied using Mario Kart this morning.
  </li><li>Oh my Lord, I thought the Lord was gonna return.
 Agee gets up, second service, to give a prophetic word.
 And I'm partially tuned out
 because we're getting to the end of the service
 and there was a lot of stuff going on this morning
 that I was having a deal with
 and I'm catching up on text messages,
 trying to tell the pastors,
 "This has happened, this has happened."
 And Agee stands up and so she's given a prophetic word
 and she says, "This is a bit of a weird example,
 "so stay with me."
 But it's like Mario Kart.
 And I was like, "Wait."
  </li><li>Wait, what?
  </li><li>What now?
 Like, Lord Jesus, thank you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>This prayer and fasting has worked out.
 My wife, my wife is now floonin'.
 And so you gave a prophetic word about Maricor,
 which I really liked.
  </li><li>Thanks.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I thought I would get a bigger reaction for me.
 You just looked up.
 (laughs)
 Like in a shack.
  </li><li>Yeah, I was in shock and trauma.
 All right, now we're done with our weekly catch up.
  </li><li>We are.
 Oh, but I wanted to say one thing.
  </li><li>Yes, go on.
  </li><li>Okay.
 My one thing is I wanted to give a shout out
 to the girl who said hi to me at Whole Foods
 in the parking lot.
 Apparently you listened to the podcast,
 I didn't catch your name
 'cause we were yelling across the parking lot,
 but thanks for saying hi.
  </li><li>Okay, now we're done with the weekly catch up.
  </li><li>Now we're done.
  </li><li>I normally introduce the main topic for this week,
 but I'm gonna let you enter the main topic for this week.
  </li><li>Okay. - Go ahead.
  </li><li>Okay, so this is a complete departure, basically,
 from normally we pick a topic
 and we have a conversation about it,
 But you asked me to come up with the idea for tonight.
 Yeah.
 And I thought it would be kind of fun to talk about our favorite three things for
 each season.
 Now, and I said to you, what kind of seasons do you mean like a season of
 breakthrough, a season of abundance, a season of lack?
 And you said fall, winter, spring and summer.
 And I was like, wait, what now?
 You want us to talk about what?
 So basically this is straight up fluff.
 It's just talking about the things that we enjoy the most in each season just for fun.
 Like as a get to know us thing.
 OK, and you have three things you like about each season.
 Well, I don't have them pre-programmed.
 I just thought we would start to talk and they would flow.
 I'm going to go on Wikipedia and find out other people three favorite.
 That's cheating.
 You have to come up with your own.
 OK.
 All right, well, then you're fully in control of the session.
 So take it away.
 Well, shall we start with fall since we're in fall?
 Oh, sure.
 OK, for fall, my first one would be the leaves turning color.
 I love it.
 It's beautiful.
 Is it my turn?
 Yes, you get to do one.
 I like camping.
 That's my second one.
 You can't say camping.
 I should have done this differently.
 OK, go ahead.
 Go ahead.
 Yeah.
 Well, camping in the fall was brilliant.
 There was no bugs.
 It's true.
 It wasn't hot or cute.
 Well, it's kind of humid, but it was just beautiful and I loved it.
 And people were teasing me church this week, like, Oh, did you go camping this week?
 I was like, no, and I'm kind of sad about it.
 That's so amazing.
 See, look, the Lord is doing miraculous things.
 You're in a Mario car.
 I mean, the camping.
 I don't know.
 What the heck is going on?
 He is on the move.
 All right.
 You're number two.
 My number two was going to be camping, but it shall be.
 Um, campfires.
 Yeah, that's right. It's slightly different, but because we can also do campfires on our
 back porch. Actually, should we be doing that on our back porch?
 A very good listener wrote in and told me what to do about having a fire pit on our deck.
 Oh. So I have instructions and materials I need to get from Home Depot to make sure it's safe.
 Really? So it's not safe the way we've been doing it.
 Well, I don't, I mean, a, we haven't really had any fire, so it's fine so far.
 Okay. Well, we've had two, I think. But yeah. All right, good.
 My, my one is the light.
 I really like, is it the length of the light?
 Is it the color of the light, you know, with sun and stuff?
 The sun and stuff.
 I'm doing my best here.
 I'm trying to engage.
 I think that's the way I said my comfort.
 The sun and stuff.
 Yeah, baby, the light does come from the sun and stuff.
 No, I mean, the light is a different angle or hue.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And fall, it's just, I love it.
 Yeah.
 That's what I love.
 Yeah.
 Um, I like all the drinks that you feel like you can't drink during the summer
 because they're not healthy, but it's fall now and you're wearing big sweaters.
 So you can drink pumpkin spice lattes and things like that.
 I though, you know, Starbucks has worked on you.
 That's right.
 Did you even know what pumpkin spice was before Starbucks?
 Did you ever crave pumpkin spice?
 Anything?
 Well, I mean, I've been drinking Starbucks for.
 20 years or something. So it's hard to remember. But yes, I like pumpkin spice lattes.
 You know what my last thing is? You're going to wish you'd said it.
 Oh, okay. Go ahead.
 The evenings in the fall.
 Okay.
 I like going outside in the evenings because there's a cool crisp sense to the air. And I like it.
 I like that we could sit out on our deck. Even though it's dark.
 Yeah.
 And it's a little bit chilly, but it's something lovely, which we can do.
 We can have a fire.
 I'm going to go to this piece.
 I love these kind of podcast next.
 Winter next is winter.
 I like turning on the fire.
 I'd like to say like building a fire, but we have a fireplace that you turn on,
 but I like running the fire.
 It just makes me feel cozy.
 I'm spotting a trend.
 You might be in the cold months.
 I like Christmas.
 We started our family movie this week was elf.
 Yeah.
 The kids request.
 yeah, Tia wanted to Santa Claus to.
 Cause she's like, daddy, can we do family movie night?
 I'm like, sure.
 And then what do you want to watch?
 She said, remember last year we got to the Santa Claus.
 I was like, yeah, she said, there's a part two.
 And I was like, well, it was mommy's bit last time and it traumatized you all
 because you wanted to know what divorce was.
 Yes.
 So so Christmas.
 So Christmas is yours, but not Pentatonix, but not.
 Have you heard the new tour vault Christmas album?
 It is amazing.
 I mean, I knew that Brian could sing obviously, but his voice is so like it just really stands out on the album.
 The Christmas album.
 It's really good.
 Decorating.
 I like decorating.
 Do you want to tell the people about this year's decorating?
 Is my turn to decorate the Christmas tree.
 You sat on a throne of lies.
 Walk in the light.
 But I'm coming to the light purchase this.
 This is in the light.
 No, what happened was.
 last year was your turn to decorate the Christmas tree.
 And so let's talk about the shame for your control cycle.
 Why?
 Because you have major control issues about Christmas decoring, true or false?
 Yeah.
 Right.
 Which means every year since we've been married, you have decorated the Christmas
 tree.
 But you don't even like decorating the tree.
 I love decorating the tree.
 And I have all these little ornaments that I've gotten all over the world.
 and they're really some of them are very fragile.
 And you think I'm a hamfisted monkey with non-apposable digits,
 who's just going to drop them?
 No.
 So where's the issue?
 Because you were scheduled to decorate the tree this past year.
 But I secured the in between the year by offering special papers.
 So actually it's still my year.
 This is we're back on track to be my year.
 your years next year.
 So we have recorded the next year, 2019.
 Me and the kids get to decorate the Christmas tree.
 Yep.
 And any decorations we want.
 Well, you can't just go buy a whole bunch of new decorations.
 You don't get to stipulate me and the kids.
 No, we're going to town red and green.
 No, you can't do red and green.
 And colored lights.
 No.
 The thing is you wouldn't ever do that because you have taste.
 But nevertheless, we have a recorded that you're going to let me in the kids
 decorate the tree next Christmas.
 Next Christmas.
 2019 people watch out.
 It's going to look gorgeous.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 I think we've pretty much done winter season.
 Please tell them we have.
 I can't remember, but sure.
 All right.
 Say we've done winter spring.
 Is it my turn?
 I'll go first.
 Please.
 I like the cherry trees when they're in blossom.
 Yeah.
 You drive down Cool Springs Boulevard.
 and all the cherry trees are.
 Yeah, or old hickory.
 And I think every time that I see cherry trees in blossom, it reminds me of the faithfulness
 of God.
 How so?
 Um, cause it's, it's like the first sign, like it, usually the winter or the, the warm
 weather hasn't fully come yet.
 It's still like just a little bit chilly, you know, but the blossoms come through and
 I feel like it just reminds me like, Hey, the winter is over.
 know, kind of you made it, not that we have anything. I mean, we have a house. It's not
 like we're like making it through the winter outside or something like that. But it just,
 it reminds me that that God is faithful, that seasons change and that new life comes.
 So that's, that's my thought.
 Oh, what happens in spring? I don't remember.
 It gets warmer.
 Yeah, but like I'm a product of advertising. What's the main events that happen in, in
 spring?
 Easter.
 I mean, sure.
 The death and resurrection of our Lord is important, but that's not why I was thinking.
 Oh, like what is the Home Depot tell you to do in spring?
 Um, start getting your garden ready.
 Yeah, it's not that.
 I don't know what I like about spring.
 Is it like too early for me to wear flip flops?
 Well, um, I have seen you wear flip flops in the spring.
 So I'm going to go with flip flops and I like wearing flip flops.
 Flip flip as your number one, but then we get to summer and you can't say flip flops again.
 Well, I do you know I tell people if they're going to come visit us to come in the spring
 or the fall because I don't think I've seen Franklin and it's in its finer glory than
 either in spring or in fall like in spring you know you got the rolling green hills of
 Franklin it's just looks beautiful the again the light is beautiful yeah but it's not
 killer hot yet you get these bright crisp days that remind me of the occasional summer
 day in Scotland.
 Yeah.
 That's what spring feels like.
 But yeah, flip flops.
 That's my number one.
 Your number two.
 My number two would be camping.
 Really?
 We've never camped in spring.
 I know, but I'm speaking prophetically.
 Well, if we're speaking prophetically, you know what?
 I love that spring is driving my Tesla model X.
 I love it.
 It's put the windows down.
 I know, right.
 Or the sunroof is gorgeous.
 Number three.
 It's just, I will, you'll like camping in the spring.
 Oh, you love the Tesla.
 It's beautiful, silent, and kids are going to love it.
 Okay, number three in the spring would be,
 I don't know, gosh, ran out of things in spring.
 I've got it.
 What?
 Spring is when we begin to eat dinner out on patios again.
 It is.
 So again, you know.
 Cool nights.
 Cool night, late evenings out on a patio somewhere
 enjoying good food with friends.
  </li><li>Not too buggy.
  </li><li>Yeah, beautiful.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Good job.
  </li><li>Thanks.
 Summer.
  </li><li>Summer.
 Swimming.
  </li><li>Mm.
  </li><li>I loved this summer taking the kids,
 even just for like one hour trips to the pool.
 Like, you know, whenever we could get there,
 just going there and swimming with them and stuff
 was so fun.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'd go for that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Air conditioning.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Not camping.
 -No, I just love air conditioning.
 -Yes, you do.
 -I love feeling a consistent temperature all the time.
 -Mm-hmm.
 -So that would be my summer number one.
 -The summer number one would be air conditioning for you.
 Summer number two would be, I think, all the barbecuing outside.
 Like, do you know what I mean?
 Just the flank steak and the burgers and just how it, all of a sudden, all the cooking
 moves to really simple outside cooking with just nice vegetables.
 It's basically just meat is what you're talking about.
 Yeah, and vegetables, but yeah, but meat mostly meat mostly.
 Yeah. My number two, vacation.
 Yeah.
 Summer is typically when we take our vacation.
 It's true.
 And I love going away and I look forward to it.
 I start planning that in the spring.
 I could make that spring number three.
 There you go.
 Starting to plan vacation.
 Sorry, go ahead.
 No, you're number three for summer.
 Um, having a garden now.
 This is what's confusing because in North America, a garden,
 like a vegetable garden in place where you grow food where where I grew up a garden is your backyard is you're just your lawn
 right yeah what nice garden you have we're talking about the grass anything in front of your house or behind your house I have to say I was very confused about that when I first started visiting the UK because I'd be like I don't see a garden
 where's the vegetables? Yeah, but I didn't ask. But so that helps you.
 My mom and dad's house, you know, we got both. They had a garden, American garden in the pack.
 Yes. And a British garden in the front. Yeah. Yeah, for sure.
 It was funny because I think I've always thought of my childhood home as having the garden that it did.
 You know, my dad was into gardening hugely. Yeah, that would be the understatement at the center.
 We had like five main lawns, our house was on a corner.
 And so there was like these neatly manicured grass lawns
 all taken care of, and then shrubs, and flowers,
 and trees, and bushes, and it all was looked vibrant
 and colorful, that was my whole memory.
 And then in the back, my dad would grow strawberries,
 and raspberries, and blackberries, and gooseberries,
 and carrots, and cabbages, and plums.
  </li><li>What is a gooseberry?
  </li><li>That's not worth knowing about.
 It's a sour, grumpy fruit.
 Imagine rhubarb got in a fight with lemon and there was an accident on the street.
 That is what gooseberry tastes like.
 And you know, there'd be herbs as well or herbs.
 Either one.
 I just thought that that's all was, was like that.
 But when we were going through all the photos of the house and we got to see them as a child,
 I realized the garden that I knew that was just burned in my memory was the product of 10,
 20, 30 years of steady nurture and care.
 Wow.
 And it gave me some perspective.
 Like, you know, when I look at our garden or lawn, I'm like, uh, it's pretty basic.
 Although this year we took it to task.
 We've receded and aerated the lawn.
 Yeah.
 I think we need to do something about the rose bush and the maple.
 What's it called?
 A Japanese maple because I was looking at them and they're looking kind of sparse and
 um, spindly.
 And I'm wondering if they have to get trimmed.
 I'll ask our friend and see if he can take care of that.
 But anyway, my point was it just doesn't happen.
 It's nurtured over time, which I'm sure everybody who gardens knows that and are like the Alan, but I'm learning.
 Yeah.
 Are we done?
 I think that's it.
 I did my three.
 We didn't do your third.
 Oh, summer blockbusters.
 Like just brain candy.
 Amazing big movie comes out.
 I like that.
 There's always one that comes out near your birthday, isn't it?
 Yeah.
 I mean, it's like every year there's something.
 Pixar usually have something right around my birthday day or, you know, day after day before.
 They must know you.
 I know.
 Oh, and iPhones.
 Well, no, iPhones are get launched in the fall, which, by the way, iPhones get launched this week.
 This is how much the Lord loves me.
 This week?
 Yeah.
 This Friday, the new iPhone gets announced and the new Super Mario Odyssey game.
 And that equates to the Lord loving you.
 Yeah, on the same day, but there's also conference happening that day.
 Right.
 Trifecto of awesome.
 Just incredible.
 Speaking of said conference, this week is your last week to get tickets.
 Yep.
 We are.
 Are there any tickets left?
 We're about 80% capacity in the main room.
 Oh, OK.
 Good.
 Good.
 You could still get some.
 you could still pre-order your tickets rather than paying the door. Historically, what happens is
 the vast majority of tickets are purchased at the door, which is going to be interesting for
 this year. - A couple of some this year, yeah.
  </li><li>Because we're already nearing capacity. - Yeah.
  </li><li>But get your tickets. We're also selling online streaming passes as well. If you go to
 greycenter.us/heavendeclares, you can find out more information about that. I'm so looking
 forward to seeing our friends come into town this week. We get to host guests. I think the Lord is
 going to do something amazing this conference. I'm excited. I'm going to the conference for me.
 I know we're hosting a conference for the region, but I am going there for Alan Jones. I'm like,
 "Lord, speak to me. I feel like the Lord has got revelation for us." Very cool.
 And I'm excited. Me too. So excited. All right. If you want the show notes for this episode,
 we are going to manufacture something very clever for you for show notes. Go to Alan and AJ.
 No pressure.
 What am I going to do?
 You can do it.
 Just make everything we said into a poem.
 Okay, you're on drugs.
 Go to alanamaj.com/170.
 And if you'd like to ask us a question, like Alisa did this week, she asked, "Which churches
 in the St. Louis area has A.G. been visiting?"
 Answer.
 Southgate.
 If you'd like to ask us a question, any question, go to alanamaj.com/ask and we'll do our best
 answer your question on air. Also, I'm making an executive decision. I'm just forecasting
 our level of energy next Sunday after having run the week we're about to run.
 Yes. It is unlikely we are going to have time to record a podcast.
 Super unlikely. Yes, that's correct. So next week there will be no new podcast,
 but the following week we will pick up where we left off.
 Possibly with special guests. Have a great week. Bye.
 Faith, life, communication, tacos and video games
 Pale you donuts and the kindness of God
 But things we deal with every day
 From Franklin, Tennessee
 They are just like you and me
 Alan, an H.A.
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 Sharing their life, experience it
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 They talk about faith in God and everything under the sun
 If you are a human being, there's something here for everyone
