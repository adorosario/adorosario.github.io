<p> I'll live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Welcome to episode 210 of Keeping Up With The Joneses.
 This week we're talking about authority with our dear friend David Campbell,
 but before we get to that and before we introduce him,
 AJ Jones is something very special about the day we're recording this.
 There is. Today is the 10-year anniversary of the day that we
 actually landed in the US to change our entire lives, basically, to move from Toronto and
 being at TSCF and being with John and Carol to being at Grey Centre and serving Jeff and
 Becky, today is the day.<br/>
 Yeah, I was thinking about it because I have got the little thing on Apple photos, as that
 was called, on this day.<br/>
 And I realized that was the day that we landed at the airport.
 If you follow me on Instagram, you'll see me with a random, smiley, elderly woman.
 And it was the first person I saw, but it was the first person I remember landing in
 America.<br/>
 She was a volunteer at the airport.<br/>
 She had an American flag, and she was just her job was to welcome people.
 So I just ran up to her, "Can I have a photo?
 I'm new to America.<br/>
 Oh my gosh, that's amazing."<br/>
 And then if I remember correctly, we went to McDonald's and I had a super-sized breakfast
 and thought, "I love the land of the free and the home of the brave."
 Did you?<br/>
 Did we go to McDonald's?<br/>
 I don't remember.<br/>
 Do you remember I was sick when we got here?
 No.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 I remember a friend Brad saying, "Hey, just because they can super size, you don't always
 need to."<br/>
 I should write like a Welcome to America beginners guide about all the things that you need
 to know that you might not know.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And we're 10 years, baby.<br/>
 10 years.<br/>
 So this day, I'm not nostalgic and I don't tend to remember things as you probably are
 aware of.<br/>
 I don't tend to remember dates or stuff like that,
 but for whatever reason, being in America,
 10 years, totally reminded me.<br/>
 I'm so grateful, love America.
</p><ul>
  <li>Same. - Love that move.
  </li><li>I've actually been thinking about it for months, babe.
 I was sort of counting down inside my head
 or inside my heart, however you wanna view it,
 to today when it would be 10 years.
 I don't know why.
 I mean, I sort of, I don't know,
 I expected something to happen today, maybe so will.
  </li><li>I love your optimism.
 730 p.m. on a Sunday night does matter maybe still most church services don't start until 730 at night
 You mean you're expecting fireworks or I don't know I just I I've been excited about this day
 So me too. I don't know I love it. Who knows I feel like my reward for being in America for 10 years is being in America for 10 years
 Okay, I mean I've loved every part of it
 Even though it's been really really hard things. There's been a love it really great highs and and not that many
 any lows really. But all worth it. Oh, so worth it. Oh, I mean, I love, I love being here
 too. If I could move a posse if people from Toronto to here, I'd be even happier, but
 I'm pretty sure I'm not gonna be allowed to do that. So you and your posse me my posse.
 All right. Well, what's happened this week? Tell me goodness. It's it feels funny, doesn't
 it? Because it was sort of a strange week for us. Because we had a bunch of days off.
 And so I actually don't even know what day it is today.
 We ended the year with a bunch of unused vacation days.
 Yeah.
 And they don't roll over.
 Nope.
 So in order to be compliant with our HR and be well rested and the pizza boss, December
 kind of looks like a patchwork quilt.
 Yeah.
 So like last week we worked Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, then had off Wednesday, Thursday,
 Friday, Saturday, yes, went to work today by teaching at the school Monday and Tuesday
 and then we're off again.
 Right.
 summertime. Yeah. Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Except for Sunday.
 Yeah.
 With one Sunday in the mix.
 So it's a little bit of, like I said, a patchwork quilt, but it's been glorious.
 I taught on boundaries in first year.
 You did.
 And it was amazing.
 I love that teaching.
 Yeah.
 It totally changed my life.
 It did.
 I would imagine the part of the reason the last 10 years have been so glorious is in part
 because of boundaries.
 Being able to say no.
 Yeah.
 Being able to say yes.
 Yeah.
 saying or hearing no. No, or yes.
 Oh, what a glorious revelation.
 I'm so grateful for the people who told me that message.
 And I think I did Ephesians this week.
 Oh, yes, you did.
 I was wondering who taught and said, did you?
 Well, that's what I was thinking.
 I was like, gosh, who taught in second year?
 Wait, it was me.
 I mean, I really, I feel sort of discombobulated.
 I kept waking up in the morning and thinking, what day is it?
 Is it Saturday yet?
 Is it Sunday yet?
 You went verse by verse through Ephesians.
 Yeah.
 First by verse through Ephesians.
 I love it.
 I love anytime that you get to dive into the word of God and really mind things.
 It's I think it's really exciting.
 So yeah, it was very fun.
 That was basically our week.
 Even verse by verse through visions.
 Yeah, I taught boundaries.
 Yeah, we had a date on Tuesday night.
 I meant to say Richard Vider start Monday night, Emily.
 Yeah.
 And was just absolutely fantastic.
 Oh, good.
 Oh, I just I loved his message.
 She just absolutely fed me and it was glorious.
 It was just beautiful to receive.
 And I left feeling so full of the word of God.
 So well done, Richard Viders, for sure.
  </li><li>Good job.
 I did hear a lot of great feedback about it.
 I didn't get there on Monday night.
  </li><li>I put link in the show notes for people who missed it
 or you would like to be encouraged.
 It's really, really good.
 So that was Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.
 I don't even remember Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
 I basically remember we were in a pajamas a lot.
  </li><li>Well, Wednesday, we spent the whole day in pajamas
 until I eventually had to put on clothes to take Abby the youth.
 Oh, what a burden.
 I know it was horrible.
 But no, we went on the Christmas lights tour,
 except you didn't go because Muggies wasn't feeling great.
 So you stayed home with Muggs.
 Annie, you stood up to go on Christmas lights tour.
 No, it was really fun.
 It's true.
 Kind of loud.
 Yeah, but fun.
 Would I have enjoyed it?
 No, you wouldn't have liked it at all.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 But Tia and I got to ride on a bus with a bunch of carolers
 and hold hands.
 Oh, I'm so glad I messed up.
 So, yes.
 It was amazing.
 coming out in a rast just talking about it.
  </li><li>And then Thursday, mostly let's be honest,
 we cleaned our house.
  </li><li>We did, we have,
 aforementioned friend David Stain was,
 is it true that we only tied our house
 when we have gas coming?
  </li><li>I think so.
  </li><li>But pretty much it's like,
 it's so bad, but it's kind of true.
 I insulated the garage.
  </li><li>You did, which hopefully is gonna solve
 our heat fluctuation problem above the garage.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm fixing songs when we can
 insulate in garage as the next.
 You're just a man of men.
 Wait, the men of, yes, the man of men.
 There you go.
 Yeah.
 And then we did Christmas shopping?
 I did.
 Well, I did too, but you know nothing of that.
 Oh, yes.
 Do you want to tell them about our thing this year?
 No.
 Oh.
 Maybe in the new year, if it works.
 I'm nervous.
 AJ is a high gifts person.
 I am.
 get scared buying age of gifts because it feels like a minefield.
 And I mean, I thought you put pressure on me.
 Well, usually we do like Amazon lists or something and say, here's
 something I would like.
 Is that what you do?
 I've never looked at your Amazon wishlist.
 Maybe that's what I should do.
 Well, you do Amazon wishlist and I usually say, I would like this, you
 know, like, and it's usually for something for the kitchen.
 Right.
 which then feels weird because it feels like anyway, I've gone out and
 a limb this year and I hope I'm right, but I'm nervous.
 So I don't want to talk about telling you.
 I guess listeners, you're going to find out in the new year if he was right
 or if he should have been nervous.
 Yeah.
 But I've gotten most of the kids done now.
 So that's great.
 Good.
 Should we talk about main topic?
 I think we should.
 In order to do that, we need to introduce Mr.
 David Campbell.
 We do.
 Okay, you're there. Good. Just checking. Episode 90, for those of you have not heard the Dalsa
 Tons of David Campbell before. David, tell us what do you do for a living again?
 I'm part of one of the larger Pentecostal Domination in the UK. I am one of the national leaders there
 and I with special responsibility to look after the South East of England, including London,
 which for me means oversight of 140 churches and 200 pastors. Good. So you really are a pastor
 of the pastor and leader to leaders.
 That's the way it goes.
 Well, that's perfect because our topic tonight is all about authority.
 Oh, wait, wait, before we start the topic, are you about to freestyle rap?
 Well, no, I'm not going to freestyle rap.
 OK, I was just wondering if you could give us some Scottish lessons because you
 have like a legit Scottish accent.
 This is true.
 This is true.
 And Alan's has kind of diminished or wavered.
 Well, it's important to understand that David and I didn't have the same accent to
 begin with. And the same way that you would have like an American accent, like a New York
 accent, a California accent and a Louisiana accent are all completely different. Yes.
 David is from the West Coast of Scotland and I'm from the East Coast of Scotland. Right.
 I have I have great faith he could give you a refresher. So I was wondering if he could
 say a couple Scottish expressions and then you could say them and maybe that would like
 boost up your accent. I think everybody would love it. I'll happily say them if you say
 them too. Oh, okay, I'm ready. Well, I mean, the obvious one is that it's a
 bra brush moon-like next to next. It's not bad, really, for a Canadian.
 It's probably better than me. It's a bra brush next to next. A bra brush moon-like next.
 It's a beautiful moon-like evening this evening. That's beautiful. That's what it means.
 And lying be your lumberick. That's a good one too. I never heard that before.
 "Lying be your lumberick." Long be your chimney have smoke coming out of it. So
 that's to do with prosperity. Okay, so say that. That'd always be a fire in your grate.
 Lying be your lumberick. Lying be your lumberick. Lying. Lying. L-A-N-G.
 Lying. I didn't know I was going to have to give a fair
  </li><li>All the questions, all the questions,
 and then mind-wee's lessons.
  </li><li>Lang-mee your lumb-ree.
  </li><li>Mind-me your lumb-ree.
  </li><li>Lang-mee your lumb-ree.
  </li><li>It's the LOD.
 (laughing)
 Don't give up your day job.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I'm sure people are still about to tune into this.
  </li><li>Go ahead, you didn't say it.
 You didn't have to.
  </li><li>I never said that one had lived in still.
  </li><li>Laid and lime, that's what I got out of it.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Very good.
 All right, I have a bunch of questions for you, David.
  </li><li>Right.
 Because one of the things that AG and I've noticed is I'm not claiming we're unique in
 this because we certainly are not.
 But we've noticed that whenever we talk about authority, whenever we teach about the benefits
 of authority, for example, we've found in our life that having godly authority in our lives,
 living under godly authority has been nothing but good.
 Like we've seen incredible fruit from it.
 But whenever we talk about the need for authority, the need to live under authority, the benefits
 of living under God of leaders, submitting to your leaders, everything feels a little
 bit prickly.
 And I'm wondering if you have any observations on that?
 I'm guessing that when you talk about the prickliness of authorities, because people
 have seen abused really, and that's the biggest fear.
 And Jesus said all authority belong to him.
 So if it are all good authority, it's going to be a manifestation of Jesus, isn't it?
 And so no one will have a problem with that.
 It's when man uses position and power and what is...
 Authority gives you the responsibility for looking after others and if that is misused,
 then authority can become a very, very blunted weapon that you know, a lot of damage.
 Do you think the prickliness then is from people who've either experienced ungodly authority or godly authority not handled well?
 Been hurt.
 Been hurt.
 Yeah.
 What do you think the remedy to that is?
 I also think that we're not a reason.
 There's been nobody likes to be told what to do even if they're right.
 I mean, you're driving your car and you say, please, men go by.
 You tend to slow down even when you're not breaking the law.
 That's true.
 And so there's always something about authority that makes you think I'm doing something wrong.
 our first reaction is denial rather than thank you officer for helping me keep the law.
 So there's something about that we don't like to be told what we're doing. But I do think there's
 a sense in which if those who we are in authority to or under, if we see them as godly people,
 then we were being encouraged by the involvement in our life and actually we were wanted,
 everyone to get it right.
 So I guess it's making sure you're under the right authority.
 I remember John, John on it, dear friend of yours and spiritual father to
 to a genie who said everybody wants a king like Jesus.
 Like everybody wants to serve Jesus.
 Yes.
 And but he also said if you haven't learned
 to serve earthly authority, how will you submit to an eternal king?
 And so there's a sense where we get to practice and it's not entirely fair because as we've alluded to
 You know, not everybody leads like Jesus, not everybody wheels authority like Jesus.
 Right. There's some very unhealed leaders out there.
 Yeah. And I think AJ, part of our blessing is we've typically always had amazing leaders like
 John and Carol for one, Jeff and Becky for another. David, what do you do if you have bad leaders?
 I'm, yeah, well, let's start there. What do you do if you have bad leaders?
 Well, I think we submit to leaders that they submit to Christ. Paul said, be imitated as
 as amaze, I imitate Christ. So if it's someone's not
 imitate Christ, then please do not imitate them. And so I'm not
 saying that gives you a cause for rebellion, but it is a cause
 of saying, actually, I want to be discipled in good authority,
 not bad authority. Right. And so just because somebody may be in
 a hierarchy above you, does not mean the right thing to say. And
 I do think it's almost like you can skip a manager, you can
 sort of sort of, well, what did your boss say? What did Jesus
 say and if Jesus is saying something different to that person, then they've made a mistake.
 And how you deal with that in a godly way shows you your character as much as it shows
 the hiss and sometimes you have to say, but no, I'm not with respect and I can't do that
 because that's contravenes a higher law and a higher authority.
 And they can't be pushed into doing something because it's man's will.
 People in authority have a responsibility.
 I think authority is not but power over people.
 Authority has been given permission to exercise power.
 And so if you exercise that power in a bad way,
 then you misused authority.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And they're all accountable for that.
 So you can.
 Just because you have the ability to do something
 doesn't mean you should do it.
  </li><li>Can I ask you a follow up question to that?
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Let's paint worst case scenario.
 Let's say you go off the rails.
 Let's say you ask one of your leaders to do something
 and you're actually an error.
 You don't know that yet.
 And one of your leaders comes to you and says, "Hey, David, exactly what you've just said,
 how would you want that to be walked out as a leader?"
 So you're the leader.
 You're a leader over me.
 I come to you, man, my conscience is not feeling good about what you've asked me to do.
 How do I disagree with you honorably?
 Well, in my life, I have an accountability group and everyone who's under my leadership
 knows where they can go to.
 And if I'm wrong and something, they would go to them.
 You know, if just tell me, hopefully, if somebody came up and said, "David, I'm not
 sure about this."
 Hopefully, I would listen and think, you know, you're right, you're right, and get it right.
 But if I'm not teachable, then you have to go to somebody else and say, you know, you're
 part of the group.
 Can you talk to them?
 Can you listen to this?
 And you put yourself in accountability before there's a problem.
 You don't wait for their problem to say, "Okay, you can see these two friends of mine because
 you're choosing people just back you up, right?"
 And if your heart is always to get it right, you'll have people who will tell you it.
 Yeah.
 Because if I'm getting it wrong, I don't want to be proved right.
 I just want to get it right.
 And one of the problems with people who abuse an authority, they just want to be proved
 right.
 They don't want to be questioned.
 And servants want to get it right.
 Parents want to make people do what they say.
 Wow.
 And then it's hugely different.
 We're servants of all, but leadership should serve people, not serve your own vision.
 Right.
 thing about authorities that allows you to serve with great reads. Yes.
 But the flip side of your, you know, when you're saying, well, if Jesus is asking
 you to do something and your authority says, you know, not to do that, then you
 go, you know, go with Jesus or, you know, whatever. But surely also the Bible plays
 in there some place, right? Because like I'm thinking, I've had a number of
 different meetings where somebody is saying, well, Jesus told me, for example,
 to not work for a year, but this person's married and has kids. I'm like, no,
 didn't. The Bible says, if you don't work, then don't eat. Like, actually, I don't think God told
 you to do that. But this person is convinced that God did tell them to do that. Like, what do you do
 in those kinds of situations? It's totally into the subjective there. And it's almost like when
 somebody pulls out the card, God taught me. Yeah. So that's almost impossible to disagree with.
 I mean, if it says God taught me, go kill my next door neighbor, you say, well, that wouldn't be right
 because he's ready to tell you not to kill your next door neighbor. So you won't. But I also
 the Bible if a man won't work he won't eat. And so there's this principle. So when God
 speaks to you, he may speak to you for a season to do something, but it won't contradict his
 word. And I think sometimes I think God gets blamed for a lot and the devil gets, you know
 the story of the, they say that Satan stand outside of church one day crying and somebody
 says what's wrong with you? And he says, they blame me for everything in there. And I think
 Sometimes, you know, God gets a blame for things, the devil gets a blame for things.
 Sometimes we just have some naughty Christians around, you know,
 so sometimes they're just looking for an excuse to do what they want you to do around the get it right.
 Right. Yeah.
 So let me ask you that in a different way. So I'm changing some of the variables.
 You've got a leader, you were wanting to walk in one area. So for example, I remember being raised
 in this great, I mean, a great evangelical church that they did not practice the gifts of the spirit.
 it was that they would they would kind of not an agreement theologically
 but we saw no evidence of it and in my private life and read all these books
 and listen i'm actually going to conferences where you're speaking
 and i'm listening to all the stuff and i'm going to grow in it
 and let's say i'm in that situation and my leaders
 are perhaps leading me in an area i don't necessarily want to walk in
 can you give me some wisdom for that i think when you get out of practical
 illustrations there's no one size fits all but there's something to do with the heart
 and if people are of good heart and they're trying to do the right thing, you honor that,
 you bless them and that. And it's, because when the problem to get in those situations is there's
 no bad people involved. See if you've got somebody who's leaders, a bad person, then leave. But usually
 it's a good person who's trying to do what he's seen within their limited vision and understanding
 and own personal experience. So you have to honor them up where they are on their journey
 without feeling superior to them because you've got an experience that they have got.
 And so part of it is to respect them for who they are and what they give to you.
 But also to realize they haven't seen what you've got at the moment and respectfully say,
 "I've also received this from straight from heaven really," in that sense.
 I'm not superior to you, but I've been very fortunate.
 And so you have to respect where they are and where they can lead you where they've been,
 but they can't lead you where they've not been themselves.
 And sometimes our frustration is that people don't need us where they've never been themselves.
 And we have to be careful with that.
 That's so good.
 That's so good.
 So the next question then is, as a leader to leaders,
 what's the one thing that you wish everyone knew about authority?
 I guess that it doesn't belong to you.
 It's been put in your safe keeping from Jesus.
 And so I don't have authority.
 He gives me his authority, Matthew 28.
 Jesus said, "All authority is given to me."
 Well, that means old, sort of means old, doesn't it?
 So therefore any authority I have must have come from him.
 Because the next thing he says, going to the world and make disciples.
 So the whole structure came from that old.
 So any authority I have, I realize, is not my divine right to authority.
 It is my human responsibility to carry it well in a godly way.
 And so I cannot abuse it because it's not mine.
 It's his to bring about his will.
 Right.
 So that's what I like to say.
 It doesn't belong to you.
 You're a steward of it.
 Right.
 So good.
 On the heels of that, then, how does one grow an authority?
 I think it's the more you carry the presence and the more you sit in this
 presence, the more you will actually think and talk like Jesus.
 And so far, when you think and talk like Jesus, you move an authority
 because that's you're doing his will.
 And authority is the right to exercise power.
 And so if you're walking in the right way, you have the right to exercise his power.
 So I think the way to increase an authority is to walk into presence more and more
 in the faithful way every day.
 That's how to increase authority.
 Is there like in your years of leading leaders, is there a common mistake?
 You see new leaders make in exercising authority?
 Is there is there like a I've seen this before?
 Is there any of those that stand out to you?
  </li><li>Lots of them really, be honest with you.
 One of the biggest one is that just everybody's thinks
 they're right.
 Of course you think you're right.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Don't we all?
  </li><li>You wouldn't be doing it unless you thought you were right.
 But it's almost like maybe entering to the understanding
 that a lot of situations are more complex than you think.
 If only there was a black and white answer
 to every question, but sometimes there's not,
 But some problems do not have an answer.
 Some problems are tensions that have to be managed.
 There's not a problem that has to be solved.
 And so authority doesn't mean that you're black and white
 about everything.
 It means that you actually have discernment and wisdom
 to know the right thing to do in any given situation.
 And so there's lots of times when people come to me
 with situations and there's two or three right answers
 and you have to say, well, actually,
 we may have to hold this intention
 and play one against the other really,
 rather than have a, there's only one answer.
 And other times you have to say there's three answers,
 two of you are going to have to have grace
 because we should only do one of them.
 But does it mean that one's more right than you two,
 but this is the, that's better for the rest
 of the body of Christ.
 Like for example, you get people who believe
 totally opposing things,
 say the woman in ministry question,
 which is some places it is non-issue,
 but other places it's a huge issue.
 And I got a pastor who, he would believe that women should not carry government really.
 He might let them speak and pray, but he would go right back to a creation ordinance.
 It's not New Testament from it's bigger than that.
 And it's really strong on that.
 And I know that other people just believe that women should be apostles and they should
 be running the nomination and they go all the way up to the top.
 And those two, and two things come out of that.
 Well, one is firstly, is that I'm quite certain that I can put an argument as to why women
 should be in government, totally from the Bible to my satisfaction, totally, and no one can
 just dissuade me of it.
 Yeah.
 And also whether he can come up with an argument from Scripture that he's right and that
 headship is male and it's totally persuade him.
 I cannot prove it enough from scripture, for my point of view, to get him to change his
 mind.
 And trust me, he shall not get enough from scripture to get me to change my mind.
 So therefore, we have to hold that intention because I think they might both be right.
 And they might, so I don't have the answer.
 I cannot persuade somebody.
 And so I have a church which is close by and we have an Antioch principle where we have
 bigger churches looking down for smaller churches.
 And this pastor who holds that sort of headship concept is the closest church to this little
 fellowship where the leader is a lady elder.
 And I asked him, would you please give covering to this church?
 And he said, yes, I said, you need to know the leader is a lady elder.
 No, I just think that he is such a blessing to me.
 He said, that's fine.
 fine because he can live with the tension of actually you believe something different to me
 but we will manage that tension in a creative way which blesses them and I think I have a
 huge respect for people of that. Yeah, that's a huge respect. Okay, so here's another question
 for you. Can you think of a time in your life when being a leader looked like a step backwards,
 like in the natural it might have looked like a step backwards? And then what was the fruit
 of that obedience anyway. You're talking to somebody who's the worst member in the world.
 Really? I don't just make something. What do we have for dinner? Do you remember?
 I think there's lots of times when I sort of,
 so I'm not one of these plans on life on the back of an envelope and say this is what's going
 to happen next. I'm wanting this to happen next. But I think that I've always had a desire
 But there's been times among my foot when I loved being a pastor of a church.
 And I came to a point where I was asked by our national leader to give that up and become
 full-time one of the national leaders.
 And I never really wanted to do that.
 If I was left myself, I would be pastor in a local church.
 I think it's the highest calling in the world, really.
 It's the leader of a local church.
 when he said to me, he said, "David, that's really where your gift would be best used
 for the maximum number of people."
 So I did.
 I handed my church over to somebody else and I'm an out full-time.
 That's probably been the most fruitful thing I've ever done.
 I still wish it was part of a church in some ways.
 Sometimes you do not realize you're on gift and you need somebody outside to see your
 potential.
 Yeah.
 like a day of Pentecost, how did you know you'd a flame above your head?
 I don't know if you stuck your hand over a bunch of your fingers off, you get an idea
 about it's a hot flame of what you need somebody to tell you there's a flame above
 your head. So sometimes people authority see things in you that you don't see in
 yourself, right? And you have to listen to them. And you have to trust them at that
 point. That's why it's important who you submit your life to. I you cannot, you're
 literally putting your life into somebody's hands
 to make a big decision.
 So that would be one of the big ones for me.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think that's certainly been our experience as well
 as in it that the leaders that God puts in your life,
 they often see things in seed form
 that you don't even see in yourself.
 And it might even be really hard to believe.
 Like I wouldn't be in ministry
 if it wasn't for somebody else saying,
 hey, I see this in you.
 And really every part of me was like, no.
  </li><li>Tell the story about how you end up in ministry
 with John answering invitations on your behalf.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, well I mean, yeah that was super funny.
 So I'm a youth leader and I'm working
 as a server in a restaurant.
  </li><li>So when you say you're a youth leader, define that.
  </li><li>I mean, I lead a small group at church.
 I was a youth leader for eight years.
  </li><li>Right, but you're not the youth pastor.
 There's youth pastors.
 You're just a voluntary show up on a night.
  </li><li>I'm a volunteer, show up on Fridays
 and help lead things and whatever.
 And at this point I had spoken twice to the youth
 And I mean, the youth were about 150 people.
 So I mean, it was a fair size youth group.
 And if you ask me, youth are still the most intimidating group
 to speak to, but I had spoken twice,
 and vomited both times and shook horribly, like, and cried.
 And I was like, I, you know, this is awful.
 And then I was talking to John just on a Sunday morning.
 And he said, so, you know, here's the thing.
 a church called, they need a person to come
 and do this youth conference in Michigan.
 And so I said, you would come and here's the dates.
 And I was like, you did what?
 And he's like, oh, I think you're made for this.
 And I was like, John, I vomited both times I spoke.
 I'm not good at it.
 And he was like, no, I see this in you.
 He just said, would you go?
 Would you just trust me and go and if you hate it, then that's fine.
 But give it a try once, you know, and I, it was really funny because I had to teach
 four sessions and I, I only had two really bad sermons.
 That's what I had ready.
 So I got, I got ready to go thinking, well, all I have to do is do this one weekend.
 And then I can come back and tell Johnny's wrong, you know, that this isn't what I
 meant to do, but the very first night I got up and spoke.
 And I literally, like I think about that chariot,
 it's a fire quote, like I felt the pleasure of God.
 And I thought, oh, he's right and I'm wrong.
 You know, and that changed everything for me.
 But it didn't get easier immediately.
 It still was, you know, vomit festival every time I spoke
 for a while, because I get so nervous.
  </li><li>That's quite the imagery there.
  </li><li>Yeah, thank you.
  </li><li>I think that's the beauty of the leaders
 that I was talking about at the beginning,
 the whole thing that they see in seed form
 and the amazing amount of trust.
 The writer of Hebrew says, let them do this.
 Submit to your leaders, let them do this.
 And so there's an element where we let our leaders lead us.
 They don't lord it over us, but there's
 this beautiful element where we submit to our leaders,
 patho allow ourselves to be persuaded by.
 And I think of the good and the bad that the leaders have seen
 in me in seed form.
 And whenever they bring it to you, it's not yet fully born
 so they can't prove they're right.
 But so they might be like, hey, are you aware there's this issue?
 It takes a huge amount of trust and confidence
 that this loving leader is pointing out
 something that you don't yet see.
 And we're always the fastest to defend.
 To defend.
 But if we trust them and they're godly,
 they're speaking to our life for our good,
 whether it's a good thing or whether it's a negative thing
 that they're seeing.
 You see, people with authority couldn't open doors, have the ability to open doors.
 I find it interesting that when you're talking to each year about, you know, John said,
 go and do this.
 And it's actually boldness.
 You need it.
 I find it interesting that as you look in the New Testament, the church there, they didn't
 pray for their nighting, they didn't pray for gifting, they prayed for boldness.
 Yeah.
 And the majority of us, it's boldness to be like.
 a few people who are so self-confident as there's 30s on arrogance and 10s in badly.
 But the majority of us have a crisis of confidence on a fairly regular basis.
 And there's boldness that we need to do what is right. And I think that sometimes
 apostolic authority people see that and they open the door for you. And then they push you through it.
 Well, yeah, exactly. I think I kind of borrowed his boldness really. I was just like,
 All right. You know, yeah, well, John thinks I can do this. It's his reputation up for grabs,
 don't mind. Yeah. Yeah. He signed me up for this.
 Turns out he was right. Who knew? He did a good job there. He did a good job there.
 There was a question. Is there anything you want us to ask you about
 authoritarian? Do you want to clarify anything you'd like to say in closing?
 I think just that authority properly administers one of the best things in the world, because it
 it brings the presence and the will of Jesus
 to the reality in our lives.
 That should be the goal of it.
 The goal isn't just to make people do what you want.
 It's to bring the presence and the will of God
 to reality in individual's lives.
 That's what God authority brings.
 It's the rule of the king being manifested.
 And if it doesn't leave a greater imprint of the presence
 and the personality of Jesus,
 then something went wrong somewhere
 in the exercise of authority.
  </li><li>That's beautiful.
 Thank you, David, for being with us.
 We're so excited every time you come.
 David speaks every year so far, no pressure, but David has spoken every year as part of
 our...
 No pressure, but come back every year.
 Yes, well you have done for the last five years of spoken every year on year two of
 our school of supernatural life, which is focused on leadership.
 And so we love having this, this apostolic leader of leaders in with us for two days
 where our students get to ask you questions like this and throw out things.
 And I love that you're...
 I love that you...
 What do you describe yourself?
 I don't want to put words in your mouth.
 I think you describe yourself as an accidental profit or a lazy profit at some point, but you'll you'll fall into prophetic
 Ministry of a governmental nature. It's a beautiful thing to see. Well, thank you David for that
