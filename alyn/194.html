<p> I live in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones.
 Welcome to episode one ninety four of keeping up with the Joneses.
 With this week, we're talking about expectations.
 Expectations.<br/>
 Are you wrote a jingle just for this episode?
 Lovely.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 You're welcome.<br/>
 Before we jump into expectations, great and small alike.
 Let's do some catch up.<br/>
 Yes. The big thing that happened this week was the source conference.
 It was. Yeah. Are we working backwards then?
 Well, I'm just thinking there's nothing really happened at the beginning of the week except for the fact that my stinking daughter,
 I guess ours stinking daughter.<br/>
 Listen, our color is stinking daughter. She smells quite nice.
 Okay. I was unprepared for this.<br/>
 Tuesday night was fake graduation.<br/>
 Well, like elementary school graduation.
 Elementary school graduation for everything down here.
 Which was graduation.<br/>
 which we're growing to appreciate because we're becoming less cynical and we love that America celebrates everything and we're becoming Americans yes and we have a lot to learn from that department.
 So anyway, our 11 year old daughter is leaving fifth grade and going to sixth grade.
 Yes, which I guess is a big deal because just changing schools and it's from elementary school to junior high and anyway we go except here they call middle school is a middle school.
 They keep calling it junior high and getting blank stairs.
 And then I'm like, "Uh, wait, you call it middle school."
 And then they're like, "Oh, I understand."
</p><ul>
  <li>It's like you this morning trying to talk about restrooms,
 bathrooms.
  </li><li>Yeah, washrooms.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It's all blending together now in my head.
 I just don't know anymore.
  </li><li>Anyway, so we go there and it took a very long time.
 And--
  </li><li>Like so long.
  </li><li>So long.
  </li><li>But over an hour.
 But in the middle of it, we found out that our daughter,
 along with some other students as well,
 I don't wanna make this, like Abigail was the only
 recipient of this, but got a letter from the president
 of the United States of America for her academic achievement.
  </li><li>Yeah, she got the president's award.
  </li><li>I didn't know that was a thing, but I loved it.
 And it has a seal and a letter and a signature.
 And I was like, I am so proud of her.
 So I'm gonna get framed. - So cool.
  </li><li>So that was for me a highlight this week.
 That was Tuesday.
 And then we jumped into the source conference.
  </li><li>We did.
  </li><li>Talk to me about the source conference, baby.
  </li><li>The source conference was, I think it was really good.
 We had people from our own church speaking
 on different topics that they were experts in the area of.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So it was really fun.
 There was, you could pick one of four different tracks
 and you could go and listen to somebody
 who knows things about that.
 And then in every single workshop and every track, you got to ask questions actually for
 more than the teaching time.
 There was 45 minutes of question asking.
 So it was great.
 I can't wait to review the feedback on that.
 But for me, just for an observer of how the audience seemed to enjoy.
 I loved as an organizer that at the end of Saturday, we had run eight sessions in the
 time it takes to run two sessions.
 Yeah.
 That was brilliant.
 And I loved it was quite hard.
 I spoke at one of the workshops and I spoke for half an hour, which I don't think I've
 ever spoken for that amount of time.
 I spoke for half an hour and then we had 45 minutes of questions, but I was really grateful
 I had the rest of our senior team join us in the morning.
 Well, that was Jeff's session.
 I joined his panel, but in the afternoon, you and Jeff and Becky joined me on a panel.
 And I loved that.
 I loved getting to field questions from everybody.
 So thank you to everybody who came.
 We look forward to getting the MP3s out to you this week.
 And thank you to all of our staff and volunteers who made it happen.
 It was a great conference.
 I love doing it and I hope we do it again.
 Yeah, so good.
 On the topic of conferences, somebody wrote in earlier this week and said, "Hey, when
 is the Heaven Declares conference?"
 And I said, "We're actually announcing it this week at the sort conference.
 If you're interested, we have a conference coming up on October the 25th, the 27th.
 It's our Heaven Declares conference.
 We haven't released the guest list yet."
 But you don't want to miss it.
 You don't.
 If you're thinking of making plans to travel here, I'd really encourage you to come.
 You won't be disappointed.
 It will be an incredible conference and I can't wait.
 It's on my calendar and me, Alan Jones is super, super excited about this conference.
 Yes.
 I feel like God's kindness has designed this conference for me and I can't wait to go.
 I want to try and abdicate all responsibility so I can sit there.
 I might take vacation days so I can just sit there and not be on staff
 I just received everything.
 You can't take a vacation day during conference.
 Oh.
 I'm sorry.
 All right.
 Well, yeah, you can just sit there and look pretty though.
 Yeah.
 Well, I'm going to be doing a lot more than that.
 So there you go.
 That's our week so far.
 The fastest catch up ever.
 It really is.
 Yeah.
 Wait, there's got to be other things.
 Well, Quinn's in town.
 Quinn is in town.
 Quinn is in town.
 I went to like a little party that the Robinson's hosted for him was great.
 It was a celebrity.
 It wasn't little.
 tons of people.
 Everybody loves Quinn.
 He's like royalty.
 It's true.
 One easier.
 Quinn, for those of you who don't know who we're talking about, is a dear friend of ours,
 an old friend of mine.
 Me and Quinn were in church together when we were both in the university way back in
 Scotland.
 And just one of my dear friends from Scotland.
 And a number of years ago, we invited him out.
 And you know what we should do?
 We should do a podcast for Quinn this week.
 We should.
 Oh my gosh.
 Yes.
 Geniuses.
 just went to come on and we'll let quintel his own story of why he's a celebrity in national.
 Good. All right, baby, enough with a small talk. Let's talk about expectations. I love
 how bossy you are. It's a fourth right. It's amazing. I just need to wear my librarian
 glasses and just have the whole thing going on there. Take me to your leader. I've been
 thinking about, I don't know why I think about this, but I was rolling through my head.
 If there was going to be a poll for the most disbelieved verse in the Bible, what would
 I submit?
 And I think at least a strong candidate would be Galatians 6 verse 7.
 And the reason I think it's the most disbelieved in the Bible is it comes with the warning
 not to disbelieve it.
 Well, that's true.
 Yes.
 It says, "Do not be deceived.
 God cannot be mocked.
 A man reaps what he sows."
 Yes.
 So there's a danger that what we talk about tonight, people will dismiss and just think
 That's ridiculous. But we fall into the trap of the very first part of the verse,
 trying to warn us against not being deceived. So being deceived is when you're relying on your
 own understanding of things rather than being open to a different truth.
 So the fascinating verse, we've long taught on this verse, long lived on this verse. But I've
 thinking about it from a different perspective, basically, Paul is saying, God can't be mocked.
 There's this universal principle called the law of sewing and reaping.
 And when I say law, I'm not talking old Testament law.
 I'm talking like the law of gravity, the law of thermodynamics, the law of other laws, right?
 No, the law of other laws.
 Yeah, the law of that one, the law of the government.
 Stuff that governs the world.
 So the law of gravity can be suspended for a while, like planes take off from London,
 Heathrow and London, Los Angeles, right?
 So the rule of what goes up must come down.
 It's kind of suspended for those 10 hours while that plane isn't in flight.
 But there, there, but then the plane is subject to other laws, well, it's in flight.
 And surely gravity is still playing.
 No, you understand what I mean.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 But my point in bringing up someone like the law of gravity is the law of gravity is not up for debate.
 Right.
 The law of gravity is not subject to your understanding.
 Yes.
 Not subject to you agreeing with it or believing.
 No, it's completely impartial.
 Good people are affected by the law of gravity and evil people are affected by a law of gravity.
 Yes.
 It is no respecter of race, of religion, of sexuality.
 It just is.
 Yes.
 It's like, it's a beautiful thing about the world that there are principles that cannot
 be denied.
 Yes.
 And the law of sewing and reaping is one of those.
 I agree.
 And it is simple in that whatever you sow, you reap.
 Yeah.
 And the reason that it says don't be deceived is a lot of people think it doesn't, but it's not real.
 Right.
 So for example, I could cheat you out of a lot of money and go for many years without anything happening to me and be like,
 "Ha ha, I got, I got away with it."
 Yes, but eventually.
 Eventually it's going to come back and hit me.
 Yes.
 The new age or some other kind of modern, what do you call them?
 Religions.
 Yeah.
 Cults.
 Yeah.
 Other religions talk about karma.
 or what goes around comes around.
 And this is the biblical basis for that sort of thing.
 So if you sow negativity, you will reap negativity.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>If you sow honor, you'll reap honor.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And basically what the verse is teaching you is,
 you can actually start in your life a momentum
 that will come back and affect your life.
 Good or bad?
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>And it doesn't matter whether you believe in it,
 it doesn't matter whether you agree with it,
 this law will be an operation.
 Yeah.
 And I think a lot of times when people look at this verse, they think it's just talking
 about money and it isn't.
 It's talking about a lifestyle of sewing and reaping.
 So you're right in that it's talking about negativity and honor.
 It's also talking about things like friendship.
 You know, if you sow friendship, you'll reap friendship.
 It's talking about all kinds of things.
 One of my favorite ones is generosity.
 If you sow generosity, you reap generosity.
 And I mean we just saw that this week we gave away a sum of money.
 We had an opportunity to give more like, oh, we're so excited.
 And we gave away that some money.
 And then two days later, we got given the same amount of money plus a little bit more.
 I was like, this is this is this just happens all of the time.
 Right.
 So it is an incredible principle that I absolutely love.
 So for example, I know someone and names have been changed to protect the innocent.
 I know someone.
 Upon close observation of their life, I don't think I know of anybody who seems to have a higher
 rate of conflict.
 What do you mean by that?
 I mean, every venture that this person takes on, so let's say they're doing some renovations
 to their house.
 Yes.
 So they may be hired a plumber or a carpenter.
 Or these are all true examples.
 They're getting internet installed at their house, or they're buying a new car, or they've
 opened a new bank account, or they've registered for a new offer with a credit card company.
 So there's just five or six things off the top of my head that are all real, not made
 up.
 Every single one of those things goes wrong.
 And so then they end up in some sort of not legal battle, but just this back and forth
 going, "Hey, I hired you to do this and you should this up and when this happened," and
 just a catalog of errors.
 And I remember, listened to them talking about, "I can't believe this happens."
 And then I was like, "Hey, would you like an observation from the outside of your life?"
 And the observation is that you seem to have an expectancy that everybody who does work
 for you is going to be an idiot.
 Or they're going to screw you over somehow.
 Like you have this subtle, it's not so subtle, you have this huge mistrust over everybody
 that comes into your orbit and have you noticed that that seems to be affecting your life?
 Yeah, you're reaping the result of that.
 And it's just the law of sewing and reaping.
 Yeah.
 And I'm like, how is this possible?
 And the amount of stress that's on that person's life to keep that thing from not continuing to
 reap is astonishing.
 And I'm like, hey, we could help solve this problem real quick.
 Because I think about our life, I've had to work very, very hard.
 Again, the culture I was raised in didn't seem like we placed a high value on optimism.
 It was kind of ridiculed. So it was easier to have low expectations or no expectations.
 So when it didn't happen, you weren't disappointed.
 But it probably didn't happen because you had low expectations in the first place.
 Exactly. So I remember when we first got married and I started traveling.
 Like I had backups of my backup of my reservations because I was convinced when I go to a hotel,
 that they were going to screw me over and they'd lost my reservation and I was like,
 "Aha!" So I'm like lawyering up for every situation and I'm realizing,
 "I learned that." You know, my dad was a bit like that. He had a bit of an expectation that,
 you know, things weren't going to go great. And I learned that and I would literally rehearse
 all of these options when I was going in to check in a hotel.
 Oh my gosh.
 No, I would have like 10 different conversations in my head about how it was going to handle this.
 How can it ever occur to me?
 I know. That's a huge amount of mental stress.
 Yeah.
 Now what a waste of energy.
 Well, the whole thing of worry is a misuse of imagination.
 Yeah.
 But now what happens is I actually have an expectation that good things are going
 to happen.
 Yeah.
 And good things happen.
 Yeah.
 I was thinking about my uncle Percy.
 Uh huh.
 And I don't know what kind of expectations he might have had.
 Maybe he always said things over himself like I am a clutz, but an axe more
 accident prone person I've never met.
 So can I just tell you about Uncle Percy?
 For sure.
 It's story time with Alan and
 aging. He never met him.
 Did you?
 He's he was my grandpa's brother.
 The cocktail party who set himself on fire
 then threw himself into the swimming pool.
 But there was something electrical next to any
 electric kid himself.
 No.
 No. OK.
 That was a joke.
 That's from a movie, I think maybe.
 No.
 So Uncle Percy, so he had a number of accidents.
 So when he was a little kid, they all went outside.
 He stayed outside for too long, didn't have his hat on,
 got frostbite.
 And so his ears stuck straight out from his head,
 kind of like wings.
 Okay, so--
  </li><li>It's a good look for the ladies.
  </li><li>It's unfortunate for sure.
 And then when he was around 10, I think,
 they were playing with rifles like 22s and stuff
 and just shooting things on the farm.
 And he was cleaning it out
 and he wasn't holding the thing away from his head.
 And he actually shot himself
 and it came in through the bottom of his,
 like under his chin, out the front of his mouth
 and took the front of his nose off.
 So he had like this huge divot.
  </li><li>Do you have any happy stories?
  </li><li>On the front of his nose.
 So that, wait, wait.
 So then a couple of years later when he's legally allowed
 to drive a motorcycle, he's driving a motorcycle,
 He has an accident.
 He hits a fence and the it's not funny, but the the barbour takes the top of his skin off of his head.
 So they had to sew it back on his head.
 So he had no hair.
 He ended up having no hair.
 Here's the stuck out to the side.
 He's missing the front of his nose.
 And then he is the guy in case you're ever wondering, is there actually somebody who drank with a spoon in their cup and took their eye out?
 There is uncle Percy did it.
 So he had one glass eye.
 And so when he would come over, he would, you know, I mean, he, he didn't look horrible, but he looked interesting.
 Is that a person still alive?
 No, no, he's not likely to hear this.
 No, he'd be in his hundreds by now.
 So yeah, anyway, he, he would tell us stories about all the accidents that he had and it made me think, oh, I wonder, I wonder if you had any expectations of that.
 I mean, I don't know, but something was going on there.
 But it's worth checking if there's repeating patterns in your life that keep happening.
 If, for example, one of the most common ones I see is rejection.
 Yeah.
 So people are constantly rejected or constantly fired or, you know, just these things just happen over and over again.
 It is worth checking what is your expectation or your belief in that area.
 Yeah.
 because there could be other reasons for constant rejection and there's a myriad of things under
 the whole thing or healing.
 First judgment, yeah, of course.
 But expectations are a super powerful thing.
 It ties into what Jesus says in Matthew 9 verse 29 with the healing of the blind Bartimaeus
 where he heals them and it says, "According to your faith be unto you."
 So whatever you have faith for, both good and bad, comes to you.
 And people object to that because it just seems so over simplistic and people try and
 hijack it.
 The way they hijack it is they think, "Well, if I change my expectation, then I'll change
 the outcome."
 And that's true.
 But the way they try to change the outcome is they change their words but not their belief.
 Right.
 Right. And actually their efforts to do or to prove it wrong.
 So they're not actually believing anyway.
 Right. Does that make sense?
 Totally makes sense. Yeah.
 But I've had people do that actually.
 Having said that, I remember a friend of mine
 came to our church and was so fed up with us teaching on
 Tithing and giving that he bet the Lord $50 it wouldn't work.
 And he showed $50 in the offering.
 And then I forget what happened in the very next day.
 either he got $100 or he got some sort of raise or he got something and he was like,
 "Are you kidding me?" And it's back to that whole thing of it's impartial.
 It doesn't care why you're doing it. So, expectation is super powerful. I found this
 amazing verse in Proverbs 10, verse 24, says this, "What the wicked dread will overtake them,
 what the righteous desire will be granted." Wow, that's really good.
 It's really interesting because what it's saying is, what it's actually saying is both of their
 expectations will come to pass.
 Yes.
 How about this verse?
 Proverbs 15 verse 15 says, "For the despondent every day brings trouble, for the happy heart,
 life is a continual feast."
 Wow.
 I know.
 It's just it's down to your expectations.
 Yeah.
 How do you get good expectations if they're hard to hack?
 I think you asked the father for what his expectations are.
 I think particularly if you've grown up in a culture where negativity is the rule,
 where that's most things are seen as the glass is half empty and things like that.
 When you're retraining your mind, you're retraining your heart on what to believe,
 I think you just have a lot of conversations with the father about,
 "Hey, what does my day look like? Hey, how can I partner with you in this?"
 That kind of stuff and ask him to start to rewrite your expectations.
 also been in the community where people will call you on that stuff yes so yesterday or maybe the day before the conference,
 a lady in church keila came over to me and she had to say hey Alan i i'd love watching worship i love that you're kneeling down worship.
 And i just i said thanks so much i quit the joke and just said yeah i figure you know,
 anytime i can you i'll take advantage to do it in worship because there'll be a time when i can't and she just said another one,
 I just break that off. I was like, "Oh, good Lord, I have an expectation that my knees are going to fail."
 And that's... - Go, Keelah!
  </li><li>Yes, I just loved it that she caught that,
 rebuked it, and I was like, "Yeah, that's absolutely right." So, I think asking the Lord,
 I think part of the reason we're allowed to feel the sting of our bad expectations
 is so that we're prompted to change our expectations so we can receive good.
 Isn't that God's punishing us? The law of song and reaping is designed for our good.
 Yes.
 And yeah, it's totally designed for our benefit and our blessing, but we get to choose what
 we're selling.
 Good.
 All right.
 Short thought for this week.
 Yeah.
 But I have two questions from last week's topic on parenting.
 Are you ready?
 Yes.
 Because I'm looking at you as the parenting expert.
 Oh dear.
 Our first question comes from Josh.
 Yes.
 And Josh asks this, I get that when you become a parent, your personal time almost completely
 disappears.
 We're talking about that in episode 193.
 However, would you say that it is healthy to have some time for just ourselves, like individually
 and as a couple? Where is the balance between giving up yourself, your children, and becoming
 a child-centric home where their demands override everything else to both our and their detriment?
 Okay, I definitely wouldn't say you want to be a child-centric home. I think that your marriage
 is the number one thing that's a priority in your household. So is there, you know,
 a necessity for time. Yeah, for sure. That's part of why we're such big proponents for
 baby-wise or things where it's scheduled sleeping and stuff because we've always known,
 okay, for the last 11 years, at seven o'clock it's us time. And so sometimes we just have a
 date on the couch because we're exhausted and we don't want to go out or whatever. But I know
 at seven o'clock the kids are down and until i go to bed at ten or eleven.
 We have adult time and sometimes we have that adult time together and sometimes we have that time separately but we we both recognize i need time by myself and we need time together otherwise we're not our best version of a parent.
 Oh absolutely.
 Yeah, I think neither extreme that you present their Josh is good you you absolutely want to be in the middle there and I agree with a jay that.
 Yeah, when we're talking about hey you're your time completely disappears and you're aware that when you have kids have self-assure it just requires greater planning.
 Yeah, and we are grateful for babysitters.
 Yes.
 All right jail asked a question i do and she said this hi lnaj i'm really enjoying this your podcast on parenting.
 Are son is eighty months old so we're fairly new to the whole parenting thing enjoy hearing your perspective when you were talking about how parenting is he'll think from the inside out like a to becoming more girly i was thinking about how parenting for me so far has been really difficult and painful.
 I started some inner healing and see many threads of control and anger and fear playing out,
 especially in relation to other people caring for our son while I'm at work.
 I'd love to know your thoughts. I'm trying to figure out why I'm experiencing so much pain
 rather than healing through the experience of becoming a parent. There's so much joy in being
 a parent, I don't want it to constantly be overshadowed by fear of what if this person who's looking
 after my kid doesn't do things the way I think his best. I know God takes care of him no matter
 what? So how can I walk out of fear and experiencing the healing that comes with having children?
 Great question.
 I think that's a hard question to answer, babe. I mean, partially Jill, because as you say,
 you're entering into this journey of inner healing, and there's probably a fair amount of
 things perhaps from your childhood or whatnot that are robbing you and causing the fear and the
 anger and that kind of stuff. But it would be hard to speak with any kind of knowledge
 on how to help with that without actually knowing that stuff. Does that make sense?
 But I do think that it is a big thing to leave your child with another person. I don't think
 it does get easier as they get older, but also because you can talk to them afterwards
 and say, "How was that?" and you know whatever.
 But it is a hard thing.
 So on one level, you might need to give yourself
 a little bit of grace that it's a normal transitional thing
 to have to get used to leaving your kid.
 But also, we would leave printed out instructions
 because our kids were on a specific schedule
 and they had to eat this time and they
 had to go to bed this time and all that kind of stuff.
 And I don't think that anybody really flinched at that either.
 So I think if you can have good, clear communication
 with the people that are watching your kids
 and make that as easy as possible,
 that might decrease some of your anxiety.
  </li><li>The other thought I had Jill was,
 who's to say healing isn't happening?
  </li><li>Well, yes, exactly.
  </li><li>It sounds like you're getting tremendous healing.
 You're just on the path to it.
 So it sounds like you're having this awareness.
 all of this stuff is coming up,
 which the Lord only brings stuff up to bring healing to.
 He never does it to cause trouble
 or make us feel shame or sadness.
 So I think you're in the process of being healed,
 which I wanna encourage you with him.
 I'm not sure how encouraging that feels,
 but I love your honesty.
 I love that you're being real.
 I love that you're not blaming anybody else.
 You're like, hey, I'm realizing all this stuff's in me.
 And I'm like, yeah, that is part of the healing
 that happens in having kids is just sometimes not a glamorous process.
 Yeah, it's a bit like being under a magnifying glass at different points.
 And you realize that there's stuff in you that you didn't know was there until
 you're dealing with a frustrating situation or, you know, that sort of thing.
 So yeah, yeah, it's tricky.
 All right.
 Those are two questions on parenting last week.
 I do still have some great questions that I want to answer.
 But I am wanting to bring in an expert to answer some of them with us.
 And I haven't done that this week.
 So I am working on that.
 If you would like to ask us a question that we can answer on the podcast,
 if you go to allen and aj.com/ask, you'll find a form where you can submit your
 question or you can reach out to us via Twitter at allen and aj.
