<p> what age is officially a first it's what it's officially a first it's it what kind of first baby
 talk to me time we have ever recorded a podcast in pajamas.
 It's very true and tell me why we are in pajamas we are in pajamas because it is Christmas Eve
 and on Christmas Eve everybody in the Jones household except for MJ because he doesn't know the difference
 got pajamas because that's the tradition is you get to open a new pair of pajamas and go to bed in them
 And then we stay in pajamas all day the next day.
 Should we describe our pajamas for our listeners?
 Sure.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Do you want to describe mine or do you want me to describe your, I mean, do you want me to describe my own?
 Oh Lord.<br/>
 I'm going to describe yours.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Yours is just the most amazing wonder woman I've ever seen.
 So I'll describe both of our pajamas just so that there's actually some integrity in the podcast.
 go for it. I'm sure our listeners can't wait to hear.
 Well, mine are bright colors with different desserts on them.
 I know it's not that exciting. They're flannel. And then Alan
 still is too much. My beating heart.<br/>
 Take it. It's flannel.<br/>
 I am getting lucky tonight.<br/>
 Yes, well, they're, they're, yes.<br/>
 And then yours are plaid, blue plaid pants.
</p><ul>
  <li>I'm keeping my Scottish traditional life.
  </li><li>With pockets?
  </li><li>Because pockets are important.
  </li><li>Pockets are great.
 Women's pajamas, women's pajamas never have pockets.
 Or at least, I've never had.
 And then your shirt is actually got four minions
 on the front that says,
 bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, nah.
 Because all I am she cares about right now is despicable me.
 It's all he cares about as minions.
 He's got a minions in his stocking and a little minion hat.
 While it's fantastic that we're kicking off with the description of our sleepwear,
 we are in this to not start with an apology.
 We're so sorry.
 What are we sorry for?
 Well, we're sorry because as regular listeners of the show, no,
 we love to have a podcast out every Monday for you.
 And we failed this week.
 we did.
 But thankfully for you, there is a fairly hysterical backstory, which was neither hysterical nor
 a story at the time.
 I was going to say.
 Pretty much.
 Funny you're now.
 Yeah, not that.
 Well, it was funny because I spent most of Saturday night and then Sunday morning.
 Well, you have to go back before that.
 Well, okay.
 Well, I was just going to say Saturday night, I spent most of the night tripping out of
 my head hallucinating.
 What's it called when you're, yeah, it's hallucinating.
 Yeah, I was hallucinating.
 And then as a result, all of Sunday I was a basket case.
 And the reason for that was I had an allergic reaction to some high-powered drugs.
 Yes.
 But you're right, we need to go back in time for that.
 So I don't know when I did this, but there's two vertebraes in my neck, but two in particular,
 C5 and C6 got pinched somehow. Subluxated is the proper term.
 And in doing so, the nerve that comes out of the left hand side of my neck, C5, C6 got
 pinched, thus sending my shoulder into a spasm. I've never had nerve pain before. It is not
 fun.
 Pretty fantastic, isn't it?
 Yeah, it's really fantastic.
 And it actually led me to the world of painkillers.
 So a little bit of background,
 we're as a family, not really into painkillers
 as a life choice.
 That sounds really hoity-toity.
 Sounds like we sat down and had a family
 council meeting and decided I don't mean that.
 I just mean, generally we try and look after the route
 rather than medicate the cause.
  </li><li>Right.
 We're not opposed to if you're in pain,
 dear God, get it sorted.
 Absolutely.
 If there's a crisis, absolutely.
 But I'd rather not live a life of taking drugs
 to avoid having a change the way I lead my life
 to avoid having to take drugs.
 I'm not even sure if that makes sense.
 What I mean to say that is I probably
 haven't taken an ibuprofen in six years.
 So at this point, I go to see my chiropractor.
 He adjusts me.
 The trouble is as soon as he adjusts me and puts my neck back into alignment,
 because my muscles has been spasming so badly, it pulls it back out of alignment.
 So I end up going to see my GP.
 And when I go in and see my GP at one point in my interview with him, I am on the floor.
 In agony.
 Yeah, you're kneeling on the floor.
 I drop to my knees and biting your wrist, biting my wrist because I'm in pain.
 and he's like, "Okay."
 So he gives me four shots of lidocaine.
 -Well, first you called himself the Candyman.
 -He said, "Yeah, where we are, who can you up?"
 "I love that you don't like to take drugs,
 but you're about to take a shed load of them."
 -And RGP's don't like to give drugs
 because we go to a more of a naturopathic kind of guy.
 So if he's saying, "No, you're at the drug point.
 It's because he doesn't think anything else
 is going to help either."
 -The first thing he does is gets four injections
 of lidocaine and cortisone, is that right?
 Some sort of stare at the shore.
 Some show, yeah.
 Which did nothing.
 So then he prescribed me on a series of ridiculous drugs
 like prescription strength and a Proxin,
 gave me some diasapam, which is Valium
 to try and relax the muscle.
 And I'm on that for a couple of days
 and I'm noticing no relief.
 So he's like, all right, we have to go up a level.
 And by no relief, I mean, I don't know
 if you want this on the podcast, he's literally balling.
 We're driving in the car and he's bawling his eyes out.
  </li><li>I had dust in my eyes on that particular one.
  </li><li>Sure, let's go with that in several moments.
  </li><li>Yeah, there was moments where I was like,
 it feels like there was a bear trap
 clamping down on my shoulder.
 And so anyway, I just called my daughter back again
 and he was like, okay,
 where about to give you something called Tramadol,
 which is an opium like morphine derivative drug.
 And the most amazing thing about that is
 after taking that, I felt relief.
 that and value my felt relief.
 What we didn't realize was, and this is where the fun begins is, I'm completely allergic
 to tramadol, which means by Saturday night, I go to bed and you're sleeping downstairs
 because you're getting no sleep because I'm tossing and turning.
 Well, mostly because you're snoring because the volume just knocks you for six and I can't
 actually get you to wake up and get your nose away from my face.
 I'm like, yeah, I'll see somewhere else.
 So because I was on Valium, my memory wasn't the best.
 So I was keeping a log of everything that was happening.
 When I took drugs, you know, what was happening.
 When did I feel pain relief, that sort of stuff?
 When was I going to the bathroom?
 All this stuff that I'm sure my podcast listeners
 would just love to hear about, but I'm sorry.
 I don't think so.
 I am tripping off my face.
 At one point, my journal entry reads,
 "Origin of the Hulk has been revealed."
 That's right, I woke up at three o' eight
 in the middle of the night going,
 "Oh, I know where the Hulk came from,"
 and wrote it down.
 And then I'm delirious, I have a fever,
 I don't know how many times I threw up,
 I was just an absolute mess.
 And so needless to say, you don't know any of this
 is happening until you come up at six o'clock
 in the morning of Sunday, ready to go church.
 And I'm in pieces.
 And you're like, "Ah, I think I probably just stay home
 and look after my poor basket."
 Well, I felt fine and the kids felt fine.
 So partially I'm like, "Well, we could go,
 but actually if you've been vomiting
 and you're out of sorts,
 I don't feel great about leaving you on your own."
 Especially when we called the doctor
 and he said, "Get him off that.
 He is having an allergic reaction."
 Right.
 So, the problem with that is still no relief
 went back to the doctor and I'm now on
 something called methylprednisolone,
 which is a, what do you call that?
 It's like a steroid.
  </li><li>It's a steroid.
  </li><li>So I'm on a steroid and a jacked up level of Valium,
 which means my day is very, very interesting.
  </li><li>As is mind, darling.
  </li><li>We went to Lulu Lam, and yesterday I did
 a doing some Christmas shopping,
 and I stood on a Lulu lemon employee.
 I mean, I stood on her.
 She was down, you know, on starting out something,
 and I stood on her, and as high as the kite as I was,
 I said, "I'm so sorry, I didn't even stand on you.
 "I'm high on Valium."
 (laughs)
  </li><li>I'm gonna be like, "Thanks, darling.
 "Overshare."
 No, wait, you're not done.
 Keep going. - Overshare, you bet.
  </li><li>And then I was like, "No, no, well, I am high on Valium,
 "but I'm also high on steroids too."
 (laughs)
 So this poor woman's back and we're like, "No, no, no, it's totally okay.
 My C5C6 is out."
 Well, thankfully she was a speech pathologist.
 So she was like, "Oh, can you swallow okay?"
 Which I thought was the most natural question in the world.
 So it's been quite the week where I haven't been no use whatsoever.
 And as a result of me not being any use, you've had four children to look after this
 week.
 Yes, you've required heavy supervision.
 I've required heavy sedation.
 required heavy lots of things.
 You'd be pleased to know that I'm recording this podcast with no
 value in my system.
 Really?
 Yeah, no, I took my last shot at two o'clock.
 And I'm about to take it as soon as I finish this podcast.
 Right.
 So you'll rapidly start being funnier.
 It's Christmas.
 Yay!
 Christmas day!
 And so I seriously doubt that you'll be listening to some Christmas.
 Oh, but baby poor TT, we didn't talk about Tia.
 Oh yeah, I know a five-year-old.
 Monkey.
 Poor little monkey. She's grown here and all she wants to do is eat bananas.
 [laughter]
 She... [laughter]
 Lie. [laughter]
 morning was just not quite herself and has kind of gone downhill since then.
 So at lunch she didn't really want to eat.
 She was staying shut ahead.
 It can stuff.
 She lied down.
 And then within an hour or so she was registering a pretty decent temperature.
 And then it just says we're sitting down to eat dinner.
 We hear her little voice go, mommy, we go over and she's vomited all of
 herself on the couch lying down.
 Which is disgusting.
 Thankfully she missed the iPad, but we cut her clothes off.
 We had to cut her shirt off.
 And then Cindy showered her slash bath to her.
 Well, it's about really glad you tuned in this week to hear about my hallucinogenic
 episodes, my C5C6.
 Y'all pray for me.
 Right.
 I just I'm surrounded by a daughter who's.
 I'm surrounded by sick people, but everybody else is okay.
 But hopefully she'll be fine for the morning for Christmas.
 She bounces back.
 She gets over.
 She is amazing.
 plus we're wearing Christmas pajamas. Talk to me about how excited our kids are going to be for Christmas day tomorrow.
 Oh, they have no idea. I think one of the things, or certainly the thing I like the most about Christmas,
 is really thinking about my kids and really thinking about what would bless them.
 And the kind of stuff that they showed interest in that they probably don't remember that they even showed interest in and I just wrote it down.
 So I'm really excited about them getting to see stuff tomorrow and yeah.
 It's also amazing because the threshold of what it takes for
 somebody to be interested in Christmas lowers the younger the age they are.
 So what I mean by that is you gave me pyjamas tonight and I was like, great pyjamas.
 And that was it.
 We gave Pyjamas to Abigail.
 She literally thought we'd given her a diamond mine.
 Her eyes filled with tears.
 She was so excited.
 But that's what I mean.
 But also because hers match her dollies, Pyjamas, and that just sent her right over the edge.
 I think tomorrow I'm going to give her the wrappers of my chocolate.
 And she's just going to be ecstatic.
 And as you get older, the wrappers aren't enough.
 You want the chocolate?
 I think she'll look you and go.
 Seriously?
 Where's the where's the chocolate?
 Can I talk about chocolate for a second?
 You're welcome to talk about chocolate.
 Lookin' Debbie Finch, our guardian angels in the UK,
 sent us a care package, but actually,
 the care package was addressed solely to me,
 so it wasn't an ass thing, it was to me.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>And in it were things like Jaffa Cakes.
  </li><li>Well, I did text with her,
 and I was under the impression I was allowed to have some.
  </li><li>You're deluded.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>Marmite-flavored crisps.
 Actually, when it arrived, we separated the box,
 and you said yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck,
 like, like, like, like, like.
 So you picked the stuff you like.
 There's only like two things that I was like, yeah, that's edible.
 Cause so much of it was marmite laden.
 But I wanted to especially thank Look and Dead before that and to my great
 delight at work yesterday.
 Um, I got texts from all our testing.
 There's a package for you and it's got a UK postal mark.
 And when I went to it, do you know what I found?
 I do know what you found.
 Why don't you tell everybody else?
 I found a box of Shreddies.
 Yeah.
 One of our listeners in Scotland.
 That's breakfast cereal, by the way.
 God bless you, Jillian Crossley from Glasgow and Scotland, who packaged a box of shreddies
 and sentenced to me.
 And it's all I have been consuming since I arrived at yesterday.
 It's absolutely delicious.
 That's why most of you have.
 It's true.
 It's like half gone.
 Given by the time it's given, our kids don't even listen to our podcast anyway.
 But what's the thing our kids are going to be most excited about tomorrow?
 It begins with Nintendo and ends with the Wii U.
 Yes, I think that's definitely it.
 And what's interesting about that present this year?
 Well, you're more excited about having one than I am.
 Well, I certainly was more excited about having one than you were,
 but the excitement level from your end of the camp seems to have raised over the
 last day or two. I think your rivals might now.
 The trouble is I realize I have lost large portions of my life to the Nintendo.
 universe right so when the nintendo 64 came out.
 I got one for my i don't know what that is that was a video game to do is a video game console many many years ago and i think i got it when i was 22 23 something like that my best friend Glenn.
 He's kind of like a dealer he bought me and i just remember spending on super mario 64 which i love every minute of it don't get me wrong.
 And so I obviously had to unpack it tonight before the kids saw tomorrow and I had to charge everything up and update all the firmware and maybe look at a couple of the games and maybe some maybe maybe and I just thought.
 Okay the deep dark hole that could be consuming my life is coming my way and I'm not too sure I'm unhappy about it.
 So i'm glad that we got a couple weeks off work because i plan on just.
 Clean and dandel well here's the deal you still have to be a dad you still have to help around the house.
 Still have to be a functioning adult so we might have to come up with some screen time rules for you as well as the girls.
 I'm going to tell no i can't hear you.
 I love we have a backlog of listeners questions that we have not had time to get to.
 And I know that last week we said,
 "Hey, we're gonna come up with our favorite things
 "about 2014, but then our lives changed."
 But I promise you, we will get to your listeners' questions.
 Thank you for sending them in.
 So there's been a bit of a backlog to you.
 We did wanna get a podcast out before Christmas,
 and we have a little Christmas treat for you.
 If you happen to visit our website in the next week,
 in the Christmas week before the new year,
 you will find that we've put up there a free little gift.
 It's a little teaching called why God is like Santa Claus.
 If that sounds completely ridiculous, then listen to it.
 It's just a couple of thoughts to point us towards the goodness and the kindness of God.
 It's amazing how comfortable we are with the benevolence and the kindness of a fictional character.
 But when we have clear revelation in Scripture that God is good and that God is kind
 and that he wants to give us good gifts, we mentally acknowledge that,
 but don't actually position our lives for that.
 And so that anyway, that's a free little teaching
 we want to just give away, just go there, download it,
 have a listen to it.
 We did also want to mention that we will not be recording
 a podcast next week, we're taking a couple of weeks off work.
 Our next podcast will be out on January,
 I think it's the fifth, isn't it,
 as the first Monday of the year.
  </li><li>January 5th?
 Yes.
  </li><li>Is that what I said?
  </li><li>I believe it is.
  </li><li>We sincerely and we truly hope
 that you have a magical, restful, wonderful, blessed Christmas season,
 and that you enjoy being with your family,
 that you enjoy being with your friends,
 that you find yourself blessed and rested,
 and we are excited to see you in 2015 for all that God is going to do.
