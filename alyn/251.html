<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Welcome to episode 251.
 Keeping up with the Joneses,
 I'm air drumming for some unknown reason.
  </li><li>Miles, a little dance move going on there.
  </li><li>I think it was air drumming with excitement.
  </li><li>Okay, all right.
  </li><li>Mrs. Jones, we could catch up.
  </li><li>Yes, sir.
 It was a holiday weekend, like a long weekend.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Labor day &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 I looked up what Labor Day is.
  </li><li>A day to rest from your Labor's?
  </li><li>You but you know where it came from?
  </li><li>I don't.
  </li><li>Labor protests in the late 19th century.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>Yeah, workers uniting, complaining.
 And so some states started honoring their request
 to give them a day off and soon became National Holiday.
 And it's one of 10, I think, federal holidays.
 So if you're a non-essential federal employee,
 you get it off and most private companies have followed.
 And there you go, thanks to Wikipedia.
  </li><li>Wow, what about that?
 Did you research?
 Yeah, I'm just so curious.
 When did you get that done between all of the other things you were doing this weekend?
 I just think as a now an American, yes, but we had Labor Day in Canada and I never cared
 enough to look it up.
 I don't know because people say to me, what are you going to do for Labor Day weekend?
 And I instantly think, what should I be doing?
 Like what is a because I wasn't raised here.
 I don't know what the rituals are.
 I think I think the rituals are always the same.
  </li><li>Grill, barbecue, be on a boat if you've got a lake.
  </li><li>Yes, that seems to be like the standard answer.
  </li><li>We did none of those things.
  </li><li>No, we chilled.
  </li><li>We.
  </li><li>I tidied.
 I organized drawers.
  </li><li>Tell me, Darnie.
  </li><li>Yes, I like to organize things every once in a while.
  </li><li>You too, like if it's tidy.
  </li><li>I feel much.
  </li><li>You like to, it's not,
 it's like if the house is tidy.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>You then have passion and energy to sort.
  </li><li>Yes, and so our bathroom is now like all organized
 and sorted and beautiful.
  </li><li>Good.
  </li><li>So I still haven't tackled the junk drawer,
 it feels overwhelming to me.
  </li><li>Which one's the junk drawer?
  </li><li>The drawer with all the junk in it,
 this by the pantry.
  </li><li>You're gonna have to narrow that one down.
 Okay, the one in the kitchen.
  </li><li>So we only have one drawer that fits that description.
  </li><li>We didn't.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Name another drawer that fits that description.
  </li><li>The drawer in the console of the living room thing
 behind the sofa, both those drawers.
  </li><li>Nope, they're both virtually empty.
  </li><li>This is very different between virtually empty and empty.
  </li><li>The reason we differ is you haven't looked
 in the drawers in a very long time.
  </li><li>That could possibly be it.
 As for the junk drawer, I think just set fire to the thing.
  </li><li>Oh, go ahead, burn our kitchen.
  </li><li>Oh, my answers involve fire.
 Maybe there's some latent pyromania.
  </li><li>Terrifying. - What's going on?
  </li><li>What else happened this week?
 Well, I took Tia for a date and we went to Desanos pizza.
 Yeah.
 She was just adorable.
 I know.
 I had no idea that had keto pizza.
 I mean, it's just amazing.
 Yeah, it was amazing.
 Yeah.
 If you try hard enough and think hard enough,
 anything can become keto.
 Yeah.
 You just like think the calories right out of there.
 The carbs.
 Yeah.
 The carbs that got--
 The carbs that got--
 Yeah.
 Gone.
 I got a haircut.
 You did?
 Lord, my ears.
 OK.
 Does that what they say?
 I don't know anybody that says that.
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong>
 Do they do that in Scotland?
 No, the phrase was stuck in my head.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>We, you know how like, was it last week
 or was it like before we were talking about
 like we finally put up paintings in our house?
  </li><li>We did, yeah.
  </li><li>We moved some furniture around.
  </li><li>Yes, you did.
  </li><li>What's the last before?
  </li><li>That you need supervision.
 I feel like you need supervision in most things that you do.
  </li><li>Like explain that in specific reference
 to this weekend's activities.
  </li><li>Okay, so clear out of nowhere.
  </li><li>Yep.
 something that took four guys to get in our place,
 you start dismantling and then trying to shove it around
 on a piece of cardboard and bring things down.
 And fair enough, you got the two smaller pieces downstairs.
 But there was not a chance that you were gonna be able
 to move the big piece, but you were trying to convince me
 that you could do it.
  </li><li>Oh no, no, also. - Oh, yes you were.
  </li><li>No, no, you were. - Yes you were.
 I have witnesses that were sitting at the table.
  </li><li>Do you remember the conversation?
 How did I pitch it to you?
  </li><li>Go ahead, you say how you think you picked it.
  </li><li>I asked babe, do you think it's possible?
 I didn't say I'm gonna go do this.
  </li><li>No, no, no, no, you said,
 now wait until I'm done.
  </li><li>Because I knew you didn't drop.
  </li><li>Because I think I can do it
 because it's worked with the other ones
 and the cardboard and whatever.
 So you were pitching it like,
 oh, I really think I can do this.
 And I was like, maybe,
 but you'll end up dead underneath the piece of furniture
 at the bottom of the stairs and I won't be able to lift it.
  </li><li>And what did I do with your advice?
  </li><li>You decided not to do it.
  </li><li>I took your advice.
  </li><li>'Cause it's wise to listen to me.
  </li><li>But I pitched as, hey, you know, like,
 fresh off my enthusiasm from having to be able to do this.
  </li><li>I think you think you pitched it that calmly,
 but you didn't.
 You pitched it out like, I can do this.
  </li><li>I really thought maybe I could.
 And then the fact that I needed another strong man,
 thank you, Matt, to come over and help me.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Proves, there's no way I could have done it.
  </li><li>Not a chance.
  </li><li>Not a chance, but I was interested in exploring
 and seeing if I could and my cardboard winching system
 worked well.
 Basically, I toppled things on a cardboard
 and then kind of moved, slid them around on carpets
 and then slid them down the stairs,
 which admittedly was very sketchy at times.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But I got--
  </li><li>Even with the smaller pieces, it was sketchy.
 At one point, you almost did the splits,
 the bottom of the stairs.
  </li><li>I don't know why that thing is so heavy.
 I remember trying to get it up the stairs.
  </li><li>It's solid wood.
 for man. Yes. Yeah. But now it's moved. You have it. It's in your
 to my office. I've rearranged my very interesting books in it. Yeah. I
 know I've lined them up and I'm curious to the next time I do a zoom
 call if people will be able to see what books are on the bookshelf.
 For all of your research and all of your various different topics, it
 makes for a very interesting workshop. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, if you
 ever do a zoom call with me, you can see if you can spot what I
 I might be talking about.
 But that was our weekly catch up.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Is that all we did?
  </li><li>Really? - Yeah, just.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>That's pretty much it.
 Getting ready to have orientation
 for the school this week, so.
  </li><li>School supernatural life kicks off in person and online.
 How do you feel?
  </li><li>Good.
 I mean, I feel like,
 I feel like the same as when we're gonna fly the next day.
 like, I don't know if I'm completely ready.
 Did I pack everything?
 Did I, you know, I feel a level of like,
 I don't know if I'm gonna sleep tonight.
 You know, I like that.
  </li><li>It's funny that you use that as an example
 because that's what it would be like now for us to fly.
 But do you remember there was a season of our life
 when we were on an airplane, at least every month?
  </li><li>Like non-stop, yeah.
  </li><li>And it was the most normal thing in the world.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And we never had trouble sleeping before we would fly
 and we never had to worry if we'd packed
 because our life was constantly packed.
  </li><li>Well, we lived in our suitcases.
 We basically took it out, washed it, stuck it back in.
  </li><li>Do you know I totally miss those days?
  </li><li>I don't.
  </li><li>I totally miss being in airports,
 and airport lounges on airplanes and in hotels.
 I still--
  </li><li>I would like to travel some.
 I don't want to ever go back to the amount of travel
 that we did.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>Really, yeah.
  </li><li>What if I could guarantee it was always in first class?
 Would you do it?
  </li><li>Ah, no.
  </li><li>Still wouldn't.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>No, I ended up with a dream of fatigue and burnout.
  </li><li>Well, I guess some people are not made for life in the skies.
  </li><li>Well, I did do it for four years longer than you did.
 So let's move on.
 What's our topic for today?
  </li><li>Last year, and you did all of those four years,
 almost all in economy.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, all in economy really.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>Much grace to you.
 Our topic, but this week, if you remember last week,
 we were talking all about authority,
 blasting the goodness of authority.
  </li><li>Yes.
 in talking about that we realized we have a like our experience of authority is on the
 whole been an incredibly positive thing and what we notice are you holding in a yawn?
 Because I was like you're either having a stroke in which case I need to call 911 or
 you're doing the worst attempt of cycling.
 Can you play that back?
 No.
 Picture in picture.
 Close up of ages yawn please.
 listening to the podcast would have known only our patreon viewers would have seen the contained
 yawn and now it's oh yes chop that out and put that on social media last we were talking about
 the joy of social media no joy of authority yes and we were as we were even talking thinking yet as
 we've talked about authority in the past we realize it prompts lots of questions from people who might
 I know I've had as fortunate experience with us.
 Are you okay?
 Now what's happening?
  </li><li>I don't just have your knee on.
  </li><li>Get your body under control.
  </li><li>Yeah, I know.
 So people may not have had as fortunate an experience
 with authority as us.
  </li><li>So I ask for questions.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I got a ton.
  </li><li>Oh, good.
  </li><li>And they're great.
 I wanna start.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>With our, here's the thing,
 I forgot to ask on social media
 you know the various places I asked him for questions if I could use your name and
 Because I didn't get permission from me
 I don't want to use your name, but I do like to give credit where credits do so I'm gonna make them all anonymous
 But I do want to thank everybody for sending in questions. Yeah, thank you very much
 I'd rather or on the side of caution air
 What I say or yeah, or on the side of caution air on the side of caution
 Okay
 All right, I'm gonna now it's late at night. We're recording late at my eyes
 Shame is too
 All right, okay
 Okay, so Alan realized
 That when he keeps his phone down low he ends up with a double chin
 So for our patrons he's decided to hold his phone higher
 But then I realize I can't see it
 So he's been trying to figure out where he can hold it and not have a double chin
 And then I realized the problem isn't with the angle of the phone. It's the fat
 The dangers of video podcasting okay, all right, okay
 So I thanked our viewers for sending in questions.
  </li><li>I have to wipe tears away, hang on a second.
  </li><li>We should not podcast late at night.
 All right, one question that we got,
 that I thought was such a great question
 that kind of put this in context,
 it was from one of our subscribers,
 and they said this, when I posed the question,
 and they said, do you mean leaders,
 or do you mean authority?
 Do they mean the same thing to you?
 And I thought it was such a great question
 because of course they're not the same thing,
 and yet there is huge overlap,
 And the reason that we're not talking about spiritual aspects of authority or authority
 when it comes to government or cultural authority and the reason that we're leaving it at parents,
 bosses, pastors, coaches, that sort of stuff, your immediate leaders is by and large, the
 most common way you and I encounter authority is through the authority that's been delegated
 to our earthly leaders.
 Yes.
 that's, you know, rather than having a big, which might be a great topic to have, to talk
 about the kind of larger concepts of authority, we're buying large talking about how do you
 walk with the authority you experience for your leaders? Okay. And we've got a ton of questions,
 and I've listed them, kind of I've grouped them in order. And if you send in a question and you
 don't hear me read it, it's probably because it was so similar to other questions around the same
 topic that I might have taken some
 libertane kind of compressed them all
 together.
 Great.
 You ready AJ Jones?
 I think so.
 All right.
 This section is all about where is the
 line between you're just giggling on
 you're holding your body holding your
 body.
 Jimmy, hold it free.
 Well, part of it is, again, I don't
 have new glasses yet.
 And as the day goes on, my eyes get
 tired.
 Oh, I see.
 So look, I have to take my glasses off
 to read it.
 If I'm going to keep my glasses on, I
 have to read it over here.
 Where is the line between having challenging authority versus having abusive authority?
 Ooh, that's a good question.
 So many good questions.
 Where is the line between having challenging authority and having abusive authority?
 I think that's tough to answer on one level because like on one level, I think I'm always looking at what is the motivation
 of the heart of that person that they're, you know, what are they trying to express
 and what's their?
 You mean the leader?
 Yeah, the leader, you know, is, is their heart to see you grow?
 Or is their heart that they don't look bad?
 Or, you know, so, but I don't think right.
 I don't think when you're being led by them, you can actually assess that, especially if
 something's happened where you're actually questioning.
 Oh, are you, is it just that you're challenging me or are you actually abusive?
 I don't know what we should have thought about it.
  </li><li>I was thinking that probably outside help,
 an outside perspective would absolutely help
 because one of the things that is unique to every human
 is we're our own worst counselors.
 So part of the reason why counselors and therapists
 are so good is you can go to them and say,
 "Here's a situation in my life.
 "Can you give me an impartial, unbiased,
 "professional opinion of some of the dynamics
 "that are going on?
 "Because I know in my own life,
 I can talk myself into and out of situations.
 Yes.
 I can talk myself.
 I can justify my behavior.
 I can excuse other people's behavior.
 You know, and it's a mess.
 So we really are our own worst counselor.
 So probably getting some perspective is helpful, but it's also worth wondering
 like the thin line we touched on this last week about, you know, if you're
 following your leader and they're going in the direction that you are going in
 anyway, are you really following your leader?
 Right. And so part of the problem happens is when challenge happens, when your leaders challenge
 you and good leaders do, they challenge you, they call hold you to account. They perhaps, you know,
 challenge you with prophetic words you've had over your life, or perhaps they challenge you at work
 outside of a spiritual environment. Like, hey, actually, you know, I noticed that as a parent,
 let's do that like part of our job in the season is to challenge our kids about their behavior,
 their attitude. And I've noticed none of them like it.
 their cleanliness of their bedrooms or their teeth.
 Exactly. So like, how do I don't think there's one matter?
 I mean, of course, there's clear indications when abuse is happening.
 Yes. But also depending on our background,
 depending on the discipline that we experienced as a child,
 we, you know, may have a way too sensitive or a not too sensitive
 meter on what is or isn't abusive. Yeah.
 I wonder to if maybe, I don't know if I want to call this a litmus test,
 but I wonder if if if a leader is bringing some sort of correction, my thought is if it's
 challenging, you can ask questions and that leader can answer questions. Yes. Where if it's
 really more sort of spiritual abuse, they're probably not going to answer questions.
 Because I told you so. Right. I'm your authority. So I say jump, you say.
 That's just like a little thought in the back of my head.
 Yeah.
 I'm going to leave it with, get some outside perspective.
 Like if you're running that line between, is this that or is it another thing, bringing
 other people in.
 And by the way, if you're too scared to bring in other people for how that will make you
 look, it could be an indication that you're in an abusive leadership position.
 Does that make sense?
 That you're an abusive or that you're under an abusive leader?
 No, what I mean is if you come to me and say, hey, you know, my boss at work, I don't know
 this is abusive or this is challenging and and you say hey you know I'm thinking of like maybe
 speaking to my counselor about it but I don't want to make my leader mad that statement right there
 tells me that you're probably not in the healthiest of environment yes is all I was thinking sure so
 there's gonna be hints along the way sure unless you're really not used to having any healthy leader
 relationships in which case probably everything always feels scary all right well well done on
 stomping us on your first question. Oh, dear. Oh, so many good questions. Where is the line
 between healthy disagreement with authority and a rebellious heart? I would have liked these
 questions earlier. I'm just throwing them at you. Well, how about I'll read you the questions
 and you can answer them. Read the question. Let me see if I can even see the question.
 Where is it? Look at us. Look at where is the line? I can hold the phone in Murphy's
 burn so you can see it easier. I don't have my glasses. All right so yeah we'll go
 back to me answering questions. Me asking the questions you answer them. Okay and
 I'll just I'll just go over you. What's the thin line between healthy
 disagreement with authority and a rebellious heart? Probably teach ability
 like I think I think it's I think it's healthy to disagree when you disagree
 absolutely and to ask questions and you know ask clarification all that kind of
 stuff. It's when you choose not to hear, like when you're, I don't think we ever, as a leader or as a
 person being led, want to be so stuck in our point of view that we can't actually hear the response of
 the other person. And I think if, if we are the person being led, who is sort of refusing to even
 consider the other perspective, probably we're heading more towards rebellion, then that's my
 I thought. Yeah, that's a great thought. I thought the same thing is you that actually
 disagreement isn't bad. Oh. And a healthy culture will allow people to disagree. Yeah.
 And here's the thing. If you as a leader, and I'm speaking to leaders here,
 don't permit disagreement in your culture, you'll lose your leaders. Yeah.
 You lose your strong leaders. Sure. And so you don't have to have agreement in order for leadership
 to be present. Otherwise, you're going to move at a snail's pace and you're not going to get anywhere.
 And actually part of the reason God announced leaders is to take people in the direction they
 might never otherwise go. So consensus agreement isn't required for good leadership to be present.
 And so good leaders, healthy leaders, will allow disagreement. Just let it out. Don't try and hold
 it in. Well, it's so pointy. You could have just kept talking. There's no way, baby. It's a picture
  </li><li>That I was young.
  </li><li>There's a picture of beauty.
  </li><li>It is not, I flare my nostrils like the dragon
 for the beach jacket. - Don't worry,
 we're all gonna see it.
 We're all gonna see it.
 So, disagreement is really, really good.
 And I think you need to allow disagreement
 because any idea that is worth holding onto
 needs to be stress tested.
  </li><li>Well, in fact, like in departments that we've led,
 we're like, everybody throw your ideas in the middle
 and let's rip them apart.
  </li><li>Best idea was-- - And see what stands.
 So you have to be able to disagree.
 Well, I think about my experience with Jeff and John,
 by being led by them, incredibly gracious, godly leaders
 who, you know, both of them want to be led by the Holy Spirit.
 I can think of times where they have made decisions
 that I haven't disagreed with,
 I haven't agreed with rather,
 and it hasn't meant I can't follow them.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And it doesn't mean that they're wrong and I'm right,
 because actually their leadership
 is not predicated on my agreement.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know, my willingness to follow
 doesn't require that they do everything
 that I want them to do.
 Oh my God, woman, just yawn.
 What were we talking about?
 Yeah, you don't need agreement
 in order for someone to lead, right?
 I think about that whole thing about
 you don't need agreement to lead.
 And the reason that God has given you leaders
 because they've got more wisdom and experience than you.
 Like, for example, could you imagine what our family dynamic would be like?
 If we, if you and I only led somewhere where me and you and the three kids were all in agreement,
 can you think if we handed over the decisions?
 If we... - Nobody would brush their teeth anymore.
  </li><li>Well, think about where our money would go. - Right.
 We'd go on Pixel Gun 3D.
 Think about what our grocery budget would be like.
  </li><li>Right. - It would just be ice cream.
  </li><li>Right. - And so we lead because we've got more wisdom,
 more understanding of what's good for them.
 We do it.
 I think I just saw a vortex in another dimension.
 Guys, if you're listening to podcast,
 AJ is just yelling.
 We can never podcast today again.
 We can.
 We're old.
 I just don't know.
 Now you're making me on.
 Good luck editing this crescent of something coherent.
 So disagreement is good.
 Or at the very least, it's not bad.
 What do you do about whether you have a rebellious heart or not?
 Well, I think that comes down to are you prepared to follow even if you disagree?
 And for me, yeah, I am going to follow because again, you know,
 meaning to agree with my leaders is not part of the deal.
 Like God put Jeff, God put John, God put these leaders in my life for my good,
 for me to follow.
 And I'm often not going to know what the good is until I follow them to see what it is.
 And so, you know, I don't want to be able for that reason.
 So there you go.
 I hope that helps.
 And I would say even I've had times where I'm not not with John, but like leaders under John where I was like, oh, I don't agree with this at all.
 But I'm going to follow because John put you in place and, you know, yeah.
 And later, you know, John was like, why didn't you tell me that was happening kind of thing.
 But I still grew from choosing to follow even though, you know, it wasn't it wasn't ideal.
 All right, well, on that topic, this is this might be my very favorite question I read.
 Okay.
 How do you know if you're under good authority and just triggered versus being under bad
 authority?
 Not good.
 That's a great question.
 How do you know love?
 I mean, the easy answer is you're going to need wise counsel.
 a much longer and a cheaper and a like slower way of finding out is it might be worth stepping
 back and asking yourself some questions reflecting on is that dynamic that experience that you're
 having causing your question that is that being consistent with every leader?
 Yeah, is it familiar to you?
 Is it familiar to you? In which case, you've either had a really bad luck of being under, you know,
 these type of leaders or you could be the common denominator. Right.
 Right and I want to be caught again go back to you can't self-diagnose we're own worst counselors
 Which is why I said wise counters really helpful
 another question might be
 The inverse of that have you ever been under a leader that hasn't produced that feeling?
 Oh, that's a great question and where they go in the same direction as you anyway
 Like what what is the bit that's causing you to trigger?
 You know and like explore your story around that
 I'm trying to see if I thought of anything else.
  </li><li>I was just thinking about one of the things
 that we talk about when we train our small group leaders
 on the school is, hey, the minute that you step
 into the authority of being a small group leader,
 you can become the focus for the girl small group leaders
 of all of your students, unhealed mom wounds,
 for the guys of all of the students, unhealed dad wounds.
  </li><li>Yeah, you become a walking representative
 of previous her. - Right, and that doesn't make you
 the predicator of the hurt, it makes you a representation
 of authority, which is what caused the hurt.
 And so you just need to know,
 hey, it's probably not about you.
 And because it happens so often,
 and so quick in the mind of the person that happens,
 where they're just like, you know,
 we do one to miss a few a hundred, right?
 Like you said this, which meant,
 you meant this, which we, and we, you know,
 and we trigger over whatever.
  </li><li>And that's our story that we haven't worked through.
 That's right.
 So we're just, you know, you are my mom.
 Yeah.
 And you, you know, when you looked at me that way,
 you meant this.
 I mean,
 Yeah.
 And I want to be careful.
 Like, you know, I recognize we're leaders.
 We're leaders in the institution.
 And so it's very easy for us to tell stories where, you know,
 our people were the good guys and it was other people's stories
 because of course it's not, it's not always that way.
 Like as leaders, ourselves and kids.
 No, it's not always that way.
 We have made tremendous mistakes in our leadership.
 And yeah, on our side, we are more familiar
 with some of the stories,
 especially when we're helping people walk
 through leader wounds, where,
 but you know, we've had that ourselves, where like,
 I remember-- - But there's a reason
 you have to help people walk through leader wounds.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Yeah.
  </li><li>I remember being, I mean, this was one of the most
 mind-boggling events ever to come out
 of my group therapy sessions.
  </li><li>I'm ready. - Where I was in group therapy,
 and I had two leaders, all right?
 And one of the leaders challenged me,
 And I challenged him back.
 And then this other leader stepped in
 to kind of help diffuse the situation.
 And so then I went away from that one event.
 And I came back the following week
 wanting some resolution, like, hey guys,
 last week we had this interchange between the three of us.
 And I retell the events of how it happened.
 And then this guy said this.
 And he was practically leaning over his chair already,
 a lunge at me, and then you came in.
 I was really mad at you because we were getting into it and I don't know why you were trying to protect me from him
 And I was fine and everybody in the group is kind of looking at me like with a tilted head like what Alan?
 And I'm like okay, well give me some feedback and they're like
 Literally the events of what you just described did happen last week
 But the manner with which you're describing them absolutely did not happen okay
 And so the narrative like the facts you said this I said this they said this was all true
 the way I remembered it and I would have sworn on a stack of eyeballs. This is how it went down.
 Right. And six people in the group who've got like
 no reason why or all like no that didn't happen. Well, I think we as human beings have a fantastic ability to write story.
 Absolutely. In an instant. Oh, yeah. And my story was you're my dad, you're my mom. Right. And I was like, oh my childhood story
 just showed up 40 years later in a room and I would have sworn this is what this is how it was
 and this was their motive and this is how I was like,
 that's just a powerful moment of like,
 this is why we need to work on our stuff.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Any other thoughts on that?
  </li><li>I don't remember the question at this point.
  </li><li>How do you know if you're under good authority
 and just triggered versus bad authority?
  </li><li>Well, I think also, I mean, consider that person
 in general, like, is this, is,
 whatever it is that you're thinking at this moment
 because of one interaction.
 Do you know this to be true about that person?
 Like, because I think you're gonna have some interactions
 with anybody, 'cause we live in a, you know what I mean?
  </li><li>I have interactions with you.
  </li><li>And I think you're a monster.
  </li><li>A monster. - A monster.
  </li><li>Absolutely. - A monster.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
 But when you step back and go, okay,
 this is what I'm feeling like the fruit
 of that interaction was.
  </li><li>And you choose from that. - But.
  </li><li>Do I know that to be true?
  </li><li>I do know.
  </li><li>Thank you.
 And if I don't know that to be true,
 then actually what's my part?
 Like, am I getting triggered?
 That's what I start to ask those kind of questions.
  </li><li>I think also that brilliant question
 often doesn't get answered for years down the line.
  </li><li>Is it possibly true that AJ is a monster?
  </li><li>No, no, the whole, you know, am I,
 is this a good leader and I'm just being triggered
 versus a bad leader?
 'Cause it's like the wheat and tears.
 You know, like--
  </li><li>Do you see what grows?
  </li><li>You see what grows, you see what comes of it.
 And my encouragement is unless you're in danger,
 unless there's toxic effects on your body,
 the quality of your life,
 stay in, kind of, you know, work out
 and see what comes out in the wash.
 Here's on the line.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And usually also there's gonna be some level,
 unless they're very near new leaders,
 there's, you're gonna be able to identify
 some fruit from their leadership.
 That also should probably give you some clues.
  </li><li>And then also forget leadership.
 just think personality.
 Like I had just a series of conversations
 in the last month or so,
 which were just absolutely wonderful
 and incredibly painful to go through at the same time,
 where somebody I'm leading, you know,
 asked for some input and boy, did we miss each other.
 Now, it got resolved beautifully
 where we could talk about how we missed each other.
 But my tremendous sadness is on my very best,
 I'm bringing my A-game to be with this person,
 to love this person in a way I think that it's going to speak to their love languages
 and you know and be with them and I'm like do my best to be present
 and they just gave me some feedback. We're like no that was actually horrible like and I didn't feel like you cared at all.
 And I'm like now I'm so hurt and I'm so discouraged especially as a leader because I actually
 I'm like a I'm so glad you told me that but B I'm devastated. I don't know how it would be more loving and more present.
 Like so can we talk about how we missed each other and thankfully they were very gracious and they heard me.
 In one sense, I had nothing to do with leadership style.
 Because in that moment, I'm not being a leader.
 I'm just being with somebody who wanted to hear with them.
 But it's personality, it's life languages, it's communication style.
 So we're all humans and we all need grace and we'll have limitations.
 Yeah, I concur.
 Next question.
 I just want to mention.
 Yeah, I'm not a monster.
 You know, you're not, but I can think about times when I'm tired, it's late,
 you're hungry.
 I'm missing her person.
 I can be a monster if I want to.
 No, no, but you're really you're not.
 But sometimes like my heart can get hurt just because I've missed you and that whole thing of is this true of what I know
 Agey to be no is not
 Okay, hey babe. I'm really sorry when you said that thing or you looked that way
 I thought this was that true. No, it wasn't okay. I'm so glad
 The end all right do you want to say something else? No, I was just thinking my most recent example
 Well, my back was out and I so when I sit on the couch
 I need to sit in the middle of the cushion and then you'll be like I need attention
 So you'll like sit on the side of my cushion which then rocks my whole body sideways
 Which is the problem because I have a disc that's bulging out the side
 And I'm like babe can you move over a cushion or sit in the center?
 But you're like but I need to be with you, but I'm but I'm physical touch
 But I'm like that's all really nice and when my back's better we can talk about it
 But go ahead and just move on over
 Not move on over sit on like as far as East is from West that is not
 a meter apart
 You know our love languages have changed so differently
 hasn't it?
 No, you're still the same
 Really? Yeah, it used to be
 That you were really high quality time and I couldn't go shopping without you call me going
 You nearly home. I miss you and I'd be like oh my god. You're so pathetic
 I see you all the time and now that's completely reversed where I'm like you've been gone
 You've got me yeah all the time
 That's one of the things I was missing meaning all right you're a question about church leadership. I'm ready all right
 What are signs of?
 Controlling leadership and when is it okay to walk away?
 So two part are what are some signs of controlling leadership?
 You've been under some controlling leadership age of Jones
 You know thankfully I haven't been under a lot of controlling leaders
 But I would say
 Like one of the things would be the you can't actually ask questions or ask for clarification
 Like it's just sort of my way or the highway kind of thing
 Do you have ones that you're thinking up?
 I'm thinking you're not allowed to be yourself like if you're in a controlling environment control leadership
 They're usually trying to make you a little clone of them
 Yeah, conformity is really valid. And you know, what you bring to the table, your version of you is usually not high on the
 value table. Yeah, you're not allowed to speak truth to power
 because that's just interpreted as rebellion. Yeah, so no confrontation.
 Anything else? I would say, I mean, just even physical things like I think you'll know because you feel stressed if you have to meet with them.
 Yeah. If you, you know me, like if if your stress is like,
 you know, if you would normally get like an upset stomach or you know, whatever with stressful situations, if you're like, you know, they call and they're like, hey, can I see you today or tomorrow and your stomachs rolling and everything, there's probably something going on, but I don't know that that necessarily means that they're controlling.
  </li><li>Because that could be your own leadership wounds
 where you think the hammer can drop.
  </li><li>Yeah, really could.
  </li><li>I think about, like if I think about the people I know
 who I'm like, I do not wanna be under your leadership.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Is like they live a lie.
 They're not who they are in private
 as who they preach about in public.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like that's a concerning trait for me when.
  </li><li>They're a different person on the platform
 than they are in a room.
  </li><li>Or when your future must be tied
 to their input. That's always worrying to me.
 Yeah. Or your success is tied to their input.
 Yeah.
 Their mind.
 Like if you're not listening to me, you're not probably going to succeed.
 Or like you can't flourish outside of their vision for you.
 Right.
 That those things are alarming.
 Yeah.
 As for like, you know, when is it time to leave?
 Well, I think like we were talking last week, Hebrews 13 17, basically, you know,
 scripture said submit to your leaders obey them, you know, let them lead.
 And it says, allow them to do this.
 So the onus is on you to allow them,
 so to speak, to lead you.
 So I think there's a, you know,
 you get to pick the leaders that you're under.
 And I would encourage you to pick really, really wisely.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think if they feel unsafe,
 then stop allowing those people to be your leaders
 and find some safe leaders.
  </li><li>But before you leave, I would just, I would caution,
 I would not caution you.
 I would like suggest you have three things in place.
 Like one, you've sought counsel from other people.
 you've got like two or three confirmations on that.
 Two, you know, you've got the leading of the Holy Spirit.
 And then three, make sure that you leaving
 isn't a repeating pattern of your life.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Because it could be that the leader
 that you think is controlling is just a leader
 that God's put in your life to kind of rub off
 some rough edges in your life
 and you're not enjoying the process.
 What do you do when you feel that your church leadership
 is toxic, but you're still trying to stay faithful?
 I mean, you think your whole church leadership is toxic, in which case I would find a new
 church.
 Just like do not pass go.
 If your whole church leadership is toxic, wow.
 Wouldn't you?
 My whole church.
 I mean, depends on how you know they're toxic.
 Well, that's the thing.
 I would at least want to do a litmus test.
 Okay.
 And a great litmus test is present your concerns to the leadership.
 Like give them a benefit of the data.
 if your first reaction is, oh no, they wouldn't take it, then are they really, they could
 still be toxic, but to not give them the benefit of the doubt, to not actually offer, this
 is how I've experienced you, isn't very fair.
 So like Matthew 18, if a brother's hurt you, go to them.
 Yeah.
 If that hasn't worked, go with some other people and if that doesn't work, bring it to the
 whole church.
 Right.
 I don't mean like stand up on a Sunday one and go, "Yeah, you know, I've got this to say."
 I mean like, you know, go to your leaders at first and go, "Hey, this is how I've experienced this."
 And your greatest measure of success in being heard is to present it as an observation rather
 than an accusation. Right? Just like, "Hey, I could be able to launch, but this has been my experience."
 And, you know, see what the leaders say. That probably would be my very first
 response. Yeah. And then, you know, try to remain faithful is really noble. But often when we're
 trying to remain faithful, we're trying to do it on our terms. And I think like if we're doing
 everything right in a vacuum and we're not allowing our leaders to speak into the situation that
 we're accusing them of, it's not very fair to them. Right. I think I'm assuming if you're saying,
 what do you do if your leadership, you know, all of your leadership is toxic and you're trying to
 to be faithful. I'm assuming you've already done Matthew 18, you've tried
 confrontation, you've tried conversation, you've tried whatever, like to arrive at
 their toxic that to me is a very strong word.
 I'd also caution you to make sure that the conclusion that you've come to as
 your own and you just haven't borrowed other people's offenses.
 Oh, yeah, that's good.
 That's a huge thing. Like often if we're burden bearers, we're like, Oh, my gosh,
 I heard so and so is this that night.
 You've never had an actual experience of so and so's leadership, because you're
 picking up the offenses of your friends, you are now like,
 a certain when that's rife with judgment, and that's not going
 to be good. And as a general rule of thumb, a great way to
 increase the quality of your life is to just not borrow
 offenses. Yes.
 All right. Okay. I've got a bit late. I've got lots of problems
 with this question. Let me read it to you and then tell you,
 I'll tell you what I think my problem is. Okay. Should your
 level of relationship and/or access to a pastor equal how loyal and submissive you are.
 Okay. So the reason this is a terrifying question is because I'm not sure if it's the way it's
 worded or if it just feels like a trap to me. Okay. Like it feels like however I answer this,
 there's feels a bit like a trap. Right. But I don't know the motive of the person's heart,
 So I'm gonna do my best to answer it. Okay. And what I was gonna say is that like from my perspective
 like I'm a leader, but when I think about the people who've got the highest level of relationship
 with me and therefore the highest level of access to me, most of these people I'm not their pastor.
 Okay. Right. So, so in that case, no, like these, these people are not loyal and submissive to me
 me as a pastor, because I'm not their pastor, like the people I'm closest to and therefore
 have the most access to in my life, a lot of them, I don't pastor at all. And so that's
 not- Yeah, they don't go to our church. Right. Yeah.
 And then some of the people who are very close to me and do have the most access, yes, I am
 a pastor in their life. But the reason they are close to me is because we have lots of
 things in common and the Lord's given us favor in each other. And it hasn't been like, hmm,
 what's their submissive obedience ratio to in my life?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And having said that, it also happens to be
 that they are submissive people.
 So in one thing you should be like,
 "Ah, ah, that formula is true in your life,
 but I feel like those two things could be equally true
 and not be a causation."
 Like there could be some correlation,
 but we might be accusing that,
 not accusing, we might be confusing that with causation.
 Does that make sense?
 Sure. Those are some big words.
 Yeah.
 You're using their Jones.
 So, you mean, that's, the other thing is, do I really want to be close or have people
 who are in my life who are not gracious to me and are rebellious towards me?
 No, that seems like a really unhealthy reason to have relationship.
 Right.
 So, I don't know. The question just feels a bit like.
 Icky. Icky. Yeah. I mean, I'm sorry.
  </li><li>But then, but then not knowing,
 I wonder if we're just completely missing the point.
  </li><li>Right, well you try answering it a little bit better then.
 Should your level of relationship slash access to a pastor
 be equivalent to how loyal and submissive you are?
  </li><li>I know, I don't think so,
 because I think some of it depends on,
 if you go to a church with 20 people in it,
 those people are all gonna have much more access
 to their pastor than a church with a thousand people in it.
 And you are choosing to go to that church
 and you are choosing to allow that person,
 you know, they are the authority of that church,
 you're choosing to sit underneath it.
 So--
  </li><li>And you might never have a lunch with them.
  </li><li>You may never.
  </li><li>You scale it up to 2,000, 3,000,
 5,000 people in your church.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>It's unrealistic that you're gonna have access
 to that pastor.
  </li><li>Right.
 So if you're at the church that you're choosing to be at,
 then I think that by choosing that, you're saying,
 okay, I'm choosing to be underneath this person's authority
 and it has nothing to do with how much they talk to you,
 how often you have a meal.
 And I don't think it can.
 Yeah, or you're setting yourself up for disappointment.
  </li><li>Right, it's much more gracious way of answering it
 than me.
 What if my pastoral authority is younger than me
 and I see immaturity?
 Is my trust required?
 Well, you've chosen to go to that church and they're your pastor.
 So I don't know if your trust is required, but certainly your submission for lack of a better word.
 I mean, that's, you know, that's where you're going to church.
 This question made me smile for so many reasons in part because a lot of the leaders that we've raised up
 are younger than the people they lead.
 Yes.
 So you think about being on the school of supernatural life.
 Yes.
 I remember John Arnett came and John is what in his 70s.
 John came and he was like,
 Alan, I love your school.
 Maybe Carol and I should just take a year out
 and come and do SOSL.
 I was like, John, I would love that,
 but I got a challenge for you.
 Are you prepared to be challenged by a 22 year old?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And he's like, oh, he said, would they do that?
 I was like, oh, they absolutely would.
  </li><li>Yes, 'cause we tell them to.
  </li><li>And so I've got this great story
 and I asked for permission in advance to tell us.
 So Shannon Macleared, who is one of our school pastors.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Before Shannon was a pastor,
 before Shannon was on staff at the Grace Center,
 Shannon came and did the school.
 And Shannon, at the time,
 this was the second year we'd run the school.
 It wasn't the first year we had put an age limit,
 it was for 18 to 35 year olds.
 You'd had a dream about three people,
 five people going through the school to beta test.
 How can we make the school open to all ages?
 And Shannon was one of those people.
 And Shannon, you know, very well established in our culture,
 very well established in our community.
 Our lay leader in our own rights
 served on our ministry teams, on our healing teams.
 I mean, just well-regarded.
 Yes.
 Not on staff.
 And you said, "Hey, Shannon, would you come through the school
 and would you beta test it?"
 And I think Shannon, forgive me if I got this wrong,
 you'd been praying about, you know,
 Lord, I would love to do the school.
 Yes, that's right.
 She had.
 Yeah.
 So you worked out well.
 Shannon, who is well-established
 and is older than the majority of people in the school.
 Yes. Like how delicately and she's got children who are in their 20s.
 Yes.
 And so she comes to the school and her small group leader is probably mid 20s.
 Yes.
 And it's the first week its journal assignments need to be turned in
 and Shannon hasn't turned in her journal assignment.
 Now also it's fair to point out that you know the first couple of weeks
 Shannon's heard and probably taught a lot of the stuff we teach on the school
 through encounter weekends and whatnot.
 And so I don't know the reason that Shannon didn't do our journal assignment or didn't do her homework
 But guess what her small group leader as we've trained him to do confront Shannon immediately like and when I say confront
 I don't mean you in my office any diss it's just like hey Shannon. Can you help me understand why you haven't done your journal assignment and Shannon's like
 like are you serious and just like yeah, yeah, I'm totally serious because you have that by tomorrow and
 Think about what that took this small group leader
 who is the same age as Shannon's daughter to confront Shannon,
 who is the spiritual mama in our house.
 Right.
 And yet Shannon said like, oh, it was a--
 like that produced amazing fruit in me.
 And now Shannon is one of our leaders.
 But it's also a huge mark of humility
 to be able to receive from somebody who's younger than you.
 Yes.
 And really age, in one sense, does not
 have much to do with spiritual authority.
 No.
 Really doesn't.
 It really doesn't.
 I remember.
 And I mean, even seeing immaturity in a person,
 I mean, I see immaturity in people all the time.
  </li><li>Yeah, you don't need a spiritual gift
 of discernment to see immaturity.
  </li><li>Yeah, so I mean, I don't think that needs
 to be a determining factor on whether you can receive either.
 You know, because I think we're all working on things.
 We all have different places where we need to still mature
 and still grow.
  </li><li>And also by honoring your leaders,
 you're honoring the Lord.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I remember being, I remember getting a prophetic word
 Isabelle saying, "You will pass our people twice your age."
 And then I remember, I don't know the year later, you and I were staffing the summer
 school, the leader school in Toronto.
 And a lot of that, in my small group, I had five or six men, some of whom were quite literally
 twice my age.
 And I remember, I mean, all of them were certainly older than me, probably by about 20 years,
 some were way older than me.
 And I remember that group, there were some men who humbled themselves to receive from
 me even though they had way more life experience, way more pastoral experience.
 But they recognized, oh, your leaders who I honor have put you in charge.
 So I'm going to honor them by honoring you.
 Yeah.
 And then I remember other leaders who just like did not receive anything from me and
 by my best, guest, the people who couldn't receive, didn't receive as much
 from the school as they could have done.
 Yes.
 So my encouragement, like, do you have to know, but you get to.
 Yeah.
 And it'd be a great opportunity.
 OK, here's a question about boundaries.
 What do boundaries look like with those in authority?
 I mean, for sure, if that authority isn't good,
 but even if it is, I'm just thinking, for example,
 that people who can't say no to bosses or leaders or whatever,
 and just keeping that in healthy perspective.
 So what do you do with having boundaries with your leaders?
 Again, I think this is a hard-ish to answer because I, in recent history,
 haven't had really a hard time saying no to somebody that's not for the authority.
 Talk about why you want to say no to somebody who's an authority. Because once upon a time,
 there might be people out there who don't think you can say no to leaders. How do you know what
 you can say no to and what you're allowed to say no to? Well, again, one of the things that you
 teach when you talk about boundaries is if I say yes to this, then what am I saying no to? So for me,
 Because it's God, family, church, or work, you know, if I'm saying no to something that God has
 asked me to do, like specifically talked to me about, or I'm saying no to something that my family
 needs in order to say yes to this, then it's a no for me.
 So how do you say no to Jeff then? So Jeff's your leader?
 Yeah.
 And how do you exercise boundaries with Jeff?
 I mean, Jeff's probably, well, he's super easy to talk to, right?
 But I would just be like, Jeff, you know, I'd love to do that thing for you.
 Unfortunately, Abigail has a whatever on that night and I can't miss that.
 But the thing is Jeff values family.
 So he would go, yeah, of course.
 Right.
 Um, yeah, bad example.
 Right.
 Yeah, bad example.
 I'm trying to think, uh, like the way I answer that question in my head is your
 leader has very clear demarcations of lines of authority in your life. So let's take your work.
 9 to 5 work. You have a boss, you're working on architects office and he's your boss. So
 largely think about like draw hula hoop around the things that are responsible,
 you're responsible for that your boss has ownership over at work. And anything he asks for within that,
 that is a reasonable request and you say yes to. Now let's play the AB game. A if he asks you to do
 something that is within that hula hoop, but your workload is already full, a great question
 to ask your bosses. I would love to say yes to that. Can you help me work out what you
 would like me to prioritize? Because in order to do that, I'm going to have to say no to
 something. Which one of these things would you like me to say no to? You're not being
 a smart aleck, you're asking for input. So that's how you say no or explore your know
 when your boss asks you to do something that's within the hula hoop of your work. But let's
 say your boss and you work at this architect's office is now asking you or
 trying to make requests of you outside of work related commitments like doesn't
 want you to shop at certain stores wants you to use your your personal
 credit card instead of a business card for business expenses anything that's
 outside of work you get to say no to because your boss actually has no
 authority over those things right now part of your success and saying no is
 going to be the way you say no to. And a great, great question to use for that is, can you help me
 understand? Yeah. Okay, can you help me understand why you're asking me to use my personal card
 instead of the credit card? Can you help me understand what's important to you that I don't shop at
 the store? Can you help me understand why? It's just a great question. But draw out your line of
 demarcation where you think your boss has got a right to ask things of you. Anything outside of
 that you're free to say no to anything inside of that you want to inquire about your yes or your
 you're known what to prioritize.
  </li><li>That's so good.
  </li><li>All right, let me ask you some questions
 about what makes good leaders.
 First question, what are some hallmarks of good authority?
  </li><li>The first thing that I look at is,
 is this person under authority themselves?
  </li><li>Why is that important to you?
  </li><li>To me that makes them safer.
 It means they're somebody who's receiving input
 from somebody that those people can say hard things to them.
 So they understand how this whole thing works.
 I don't think I've met somebody who I would consider a safe leader that isn't under authority
 themselves. What are some hallmarks of good authority? People that are teachable and like always
 trying to learn. I think people that can you can ask questions to they can talk about you know
 process and and that kind of stuff like what you know where they're at that kind of stuff.
 What about you?
 My head goes to three passages of Scripture that talk about the requirements for elders
 and deacons, church leadership.
 They're pretty familiar.
 They're like Titus chapter 1 verse 5, 1 Timothy chapter 3 and 1 Peter 5.
 I don't want to read them all, but if you read them, Titus talks about hallmarks of good
 authority, good leaders, they're blameless, so they've got a great reputation.
 They're not overbearing.
 They're not quick tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent.
 They're honest, they're hospitable.
 They love what is good, they're self-controlled, they're upright, they're holy, they're disciplined.
 I love this.
 They hold firmly to the trustworthy message.
 They encourage others by sound doctrine and can refute those who oppose it.
 So, people who know the word and live the word.
 In first Timothy, similar passage, Paul adds to this.
 who've got a good reputation, they're gentle and not quarrelsome. How about this? They're
 committed to the mystery of the faith now revealed and live with a clear conscience.
  </li><li>Oh, that's good.
  </li><li>Nothing scarier than a leader who's telling you things so that you will help calm their
 conscience. - Wait, say that again, there's nothing scarier.
  </li><li>There's nothing scarier for me when I meet with leaders who are running situations past
 me not to get my wisdom, but to get my approval of what they've already done.
 Oh yeah, I got you.
 Tows me that their conscience isn't clear and they're needing outside peace to settle
 their conscience.
 Okay.
 First Peter five, they care willingly, not grudgingly.
 Nice.
 And in their leadership, they understand that they're serving God and they quote, "Don't
 lord it over the people like the Gentiles do."
 Yeah.
 Like, I love gentle leaders.
 Gentle leaders who understand their authority,
 but don't use their authority to get their way.
 'Cause that's the misuse of authority.
 People who lead by good example
 and people who are dressed with humility.
 Oh.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's a terrifying list to read as a leader.
 What makes a good leader?
 I love Bill Johnson's call,
 where he talks about serve with the heart of a king
 and lead with the heart of a servant.
 This whole notion that any authority that you have
 is there so that you can lead people more effectively?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>David Wagner's got this great phrase,
 "fruit doesn't lie."
 You know, if you wanna know a good leader,
 look at the fruit of the lives of the people
 who are under them.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>All right.
 What are some ways, I love this question,
 what are some ways to lean toward healthy connection
 with authority when you feel intimidated or nervous?
 So you're new to church or you're new to a culture.
 Yeah.
 You want to be connected with leadership, but you're really intimidated by them or you're
 feeling nervous.
 Well, I mean, see if there's any way to initially get to know them.
 Like, most churches will have something like, you know, meet the pastors something, you
 know, members class, passage luncheon, you know, whatever.
 Fun events.
 attend one or two of those if there's social events at the church, you know, to try and get to know them in a way that feels non-threatening to you.
 If you're more of an outgoing personality, you could always just walk up and introduce yourself.
 I don't think an outgoing person would be asking this question.
 Right.
 Because this person's feeling intimidated or nervous.
 Yeah. I guess that's my first shot is, is, you know, the different sort of avenues that would be easier for a maybe a more shy person to begin.
 Yeah. I would, I would explore the story that you have that you might not know you have.
 Like, so you're feeling intimidated and you're feeling, what was the word, intimidated and nervous.
 Talk to me about what it is you're imagining is gonna happen.
 What's producing the fear, what's producing the anxiety?
 How badly is this gonna go?
 What's the story that you're telling yourself?
 And maybe tell that story to some other people like hey,
 I'm worried that if AJ, if I meet AJ, she's gonna think X, Y, and Z.
 &gt;&gt; Yeah.
 &gt;&gt; Because getting some people who know AJ say, I have to tell you like that,
 literally not gonna be the case.
 &gt;&gt; Well, I've had that before.
 I've had people that are like, oh, she's kind of scary.
 I think she's super intimidating.
 And they say that to somebody who feels super comfortable
 with me and they're like, oh, I'll introduce you.
 And they come up, we have a conversation
 and maybe a couple of conversations later,
 they're like, oh, I'm so scared of you.
 And I'm like, why?
 Oh no.
 I'm like, I'm so glad we got past that.
 I'm like--
 Over the years, I've had a number of people come up
 and just tell on themselves.
 And I think that's so brave and courageous,
 where they've basically come up and just said, hey,
 I don't need anything from you right now,
 but I just need to tell the truth of myself.
 That was, I'm super scared to meet you,
 and I just want to get that out there.
 And so if you've ever felt awkward around me,
 it's just because I've been freaked out the end.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I'm like, oh, yeah, being there, done that.
  </li><li>Got it.
  </li><li>To all the understand that,
 just wait a punch through that awkwardness barrier.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I think another helpful thing is try and get in people's orbits.
 And the easiest way to get in a leader's orbit
 is to move to where they are,
 like go serve whatever they're doing,
 because by doing that, you'll literally be in their orbit
 and who you are will become known to them.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>All right, AJ Jones.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>What have you learned about demonstrating
 good leadership to others?
 So reflect on your efforts to be a good, safe leader.
 What have you learned?
  </li><li>Stay vulnerable.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Like be a vulnerable person.
 Like I do have weaknesses.
 I'm aware of them.
 I'm not trying to hide them.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>Clearly communicate.
 And realize I can totally miss it.
 Like I can think, oh, I clearly communicated that
 and you didn't hear it.
 And so maybe it's not actually that you didn't hear,
 but I didn't clearly communicate it as much as I think so.
 Be quick to listen.
  </li><li>I, when I ever asked this question,
 I'll think about Matt Croson.
 Matt is one of our pastors at SSL and he said one of his favorite parts of his job is he
 gets to redefine people's experience of leadership.
 So as a school pastor, his students come in all the time who have an expectation of how
 he's going to react or how he's going to behave or how he's going to hurt or disappoint or
 underwhelm or control or manipulate.
 And so he gets to sit with people and give them an alternate experience.
 And I think that, you know, Matt does that so well.
 He's brilliant.
 He's brilliant at that.
 He's so gracious.
 I think about how even though my motive, I might work on my motive and my motive might
 be right, my behavior could still wound.
 That's like one of the hardest things for me as a leader.
 Like I've worked so hard on my motive.
 And even though my motive is right, my words or my behavior can still wound.
 Yeah.
 That's one part, another part is that when people come to confront one of the things
 I've had to learn is people are confronting action, but I historically have heard motive.
 And so I don't know you're wrong.
 Let me explain why you're wrong because my motive was right and I've had to learn.
 It actually doesn't matter.
 You experience this.
 They're giving you real time experience on how you experience them and that is important.
 Like they're always right, even if your motive was right.
 And so that's been hard.
 I think also like one of the things I still haven't learned and I still forget.
 And it's hard to do is that like one, I forget how powerful I am.
 Like, you know, I forget the level of power I carry in who I am in the words I say so I
 can be flippant and realize that can really hurt people.
 And I'm like, whoa, I'm just joking around like, no, you've forgotten the power dynamic.
 So that's bad.
 The other thing that I've learned is I'm unaware,
 and how could I know of the stories
 that people are telling themselves?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Like I remember onboarding a member staff
 a number of years ago,
 'cause one of the things like,
 "Aji and I, yes, we lead a bunch of people."
 But we also have like direct reports.
 I have like five direct reports,
 people who work for me,
 I'm their line manager on the direct report.
 I meet with them every single week.
 You meet with like five or six of those as well.
 So those are the people who would probably get most of our attention weekly, you know,
 intentional time.
 And all of those people are very different and all those people have different needs
 and they have different stories.
 And so I remember one time, you know, onboarding member of staff and I'd, uh,
 you know, just exploring what they thought I was or how I was going to react to the
 situations beyond like I would never, how they thought I was going to respond to
 situation just wasn't even in my playbook.
 Like they thought I was going to come down to them like a ton of bricks and drop the hammer and blah.
 And so they're bracing for impact from this angry boss.
 And I'm like, oh, literally that's not how I'm going to be able.
 And so learning, like where are people from?
 You know, how could I meet them rather than expecting people to just kind of arrive at where I'm at?
 Yeah, those are the things I've learned.
 Good.
 All right.
 Last section is all about questions about kids.
 Okay.
 I would love some thoughts on the balance of children being upset and emotional.
 And how as a parent you teach them to honor authority, but at the same time not swallow their emotions.
 Like you understand the question? Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, I would say all of our kids are pretty and emotionally
 entuned like and so they have big feelings. And you are way better than I am, but just sitting with
 them you are. It's sitting with them, especially MJ and just
 sitting with him and going, Okay, buddy, what do you feel? Do you
 know what you need? Like helping them work? So not trying to
 shut down the emotion at all and not trying to shame them for
 emotion. Even you know, like, yeah, you're gonna have emotions
 when we say no, you can't do X. But you're not in trouble for
 having an emotion about having that. And we still need you to
 do it. And it's still a no. But then sitting with them in their
 emotion and letting you know, I'm processing through it with
 them.
 Yeah, I think probably the biggest time we see big emotions
 is when our children don't like reaping the consequences of
 their poor choices. Yes. And if I could encourage parents
 anywhere, it's like, it's really hard. You got to stick to your
 guns. Yes. Because otherwise you're training your children
 that consequences don't matter. And you're training your
 children to blow up their poor choices to blow on them.
  </li><li>Or that you're not gonna follow through, so you know.
  </li><li>And that's like helping them detangle like,
 hey, right now you're really mad.
 Do you think you're mad at me?
 But you're probably mad at you
 because this decision is cost you.
 You're mad at me for enforcing the decision
 that you already knew was coming your way.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And you get, I get it, you're mad.
 I get it, you're deeply sad, you just lost your phone.
 I get it that you're super sad that you're grounded.
 Yeah, gosh, I'd be mad too.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 what we can learn from this.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so trying to make the consequence,
 not punitive is really helpful.
 I'd say another thing is working on your own stuff
 and modeling, you handling that dynamic really well
 is important.
 So letting your kids see that yeah,
 daddy's tired and daddy's frustrated
 and daddy's lonely and daddy doesn't wanna go work today,
 but daddy's still gonna go work today
 'cause that's daddy's responsibility.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm thinking maybe later I could ground you
 and take away your phone.
 We could tell the kids.
  </li><li>You could film my reaction.
  </li><li>Yeah, it'd be great, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, okay, member exclusive coming up.
 Anything else, Rhonda?
 I think that's--
  </li><li>No, I think that's good.
  </li><li>All right, last question.
  </li><li>Oh, thank you.
  </li><li>What's good about telling your children, do it,
 because I said so?
  </li><li>Nothing, but it's so tempting,
 and I have done it many times.
 I mean, I did, sometimes I'm usually good at,
 like, maybe the first time that they're like,
 "What do I have to do that?"
 Well, because blah, blah, blah.
 Yeah, but I want to, so why do I,
 You know, I have on several occasions
 because Mummy said so.
  </li><li>Yeah, it is an ace up your sleeves that you can use.
  </li><li>Because we have now arrived at,
 I don't care if you understand why, Mummy said so.
  </li><li>Right, but it is a blunt tool that, you know, is
  </li><li>I haven't had to say it in quite a long time.
  </li><li>Probably the only time we play it is though,
 like you said, when we like realize our kids
 are now milking the, oh, if I can talk about my feelings,
 maybe my parents will wiggle on this.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know, if we feel like they're kind of like wiggling
 into the yeah, but well, I don't even understand.
 This doesn't seem fair.
 It's like yeah, yeah, there's lots in life
 that's really unfair.
 And so I'm gonna tell you, I've run our patients.
  </li><li>Yeah, because they ask you to do it anyway.
  </li><li>Yeah, do it.
  </li><li>Because they ask you to do it.
  </li><li>It's not a go to slick parenting move.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>But let's be honest, we've all used it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
