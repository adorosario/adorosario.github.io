<p> Island and AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 -A to Jones. -Yes, sir.<br/>
 -Epsilon 246, we have a problem.<br/>
 -We do have a problem. -Can you guess what the problem is?
 -Is it that you're showing a V, and you're trying to distract me with your chest?
 -It's not, but if that's working, we can easily pause and go upstairs.
 It's the "I've had the hiccups all day" which doesn't make for great podcasting.
 I've heard that hiccups are like the judgment of God.
 So, is there anything that you?<br/>
 Well, see, Christ took the full punishment of God on the cross for me.
 So, I'm not sure how that could be the case.
 In which case, I've heard that...<br/>
 I'm just kidding.<br/>
 Can you help me get rid of them?<br/>
 I could try and scare you.<br/>
 Go on and scare me.<br/>
 Do your best, scare me.<br/>
 I'm pregnant.<br/>
 No, I'm just kidding.<br/>
 I wouldn't be scared.<br/>
 I'm not pregnant.<br/>
 It was terrifying.<br/>
 49.<br/>
 It would be a miracle.<br/>
 I would be a miracle.<br/>
 I can't.<br/>
 I do have a brown paper back here.<br/>
 They said if you breathe in and out of a brown paper back.
 How long?<br/>
 Being Google.<br/>
 I think till your skin turns a different color.
 Let's see what happens.<br/>
 Okay, let's watch.<br/>
 [sings]<br/>
 [sings]<br/>
 -You think it worked? -Okay, well, let's see.
 Let's just get going and see if you make any more charming noises.
 Episode 246 is the follow-up to Episode 245.
 But episode 245, we were talking about how to build and maintain relationships.
 And we ended that by saying, "Hey, I put out something on Instagram and on our members
 forum."<br/>
 Like, "Hey, we're asking, this is what we're talking about.
 Do you have any questions?"<br/>
 Well, we got so many amazing questions.
 Yes.<br/>
 And we didn't have time to fit them into episode 245.
 Right.<br/>
 So now we're going to answer questions.
 Oh my gosh.<br/>
 And we have got some brilliant questions.
 Okay.<br/>
 I'm really surprised that worked.<br/>
 That bag worked.<br/>
 It has seemed to work.<br/>
 I had no idea.<br/>
 Knock on marble.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 Are we allowed to do that as Christians?
</p><ul>
  <li>Marvel, sure.
  </li><li>Yeah, just knock on Woody's bed.
  </li><li>Absolutely, but Marvel, totally fine.
 Yeah, I mean, I'd heard the one where you like hang upside down
 and try and drink water.
  </li><li>Gargle with fizzy water, gargle with ice cubes,
 drink from the upside of the cup.
 None of that's worked, I've tried it,
 but I am shocked that that worked.
  </li><li>Okay, I mean, I heard one about peanut butter,
 but you know, it's, you know, we don't need to try anything.
 So.
  </li><li>A whole episode of fantastic user-generated questions.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Before we get to that though.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>We could catch up.
 Oh, well, the kids are in camp this week.
 The kids are in summer camp and are having an amazing time.
 Oh, they loved it.
 Yeah, they're at Dear Run, which is like a local Christian,
 both sleepover and day camp, but they're at the day camp.
 And yeah, I mean, MJ was a little nervous going.
 Tia, I don't, I mean, she just makes friends pretty easily.
 She was just excited, but they both got in the car
 on Monday when I picked them up.
 And the first thing was like,
 can you register us for next year right now?
 You know, like they loved it.
  </li><li>Which honestly is what every parent wants to hear.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>'Cause our goal this summer was to make up for last summer.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Which was just a catastrophe last summer with COVID.
 They didn't see anybody, didn't see friends.
 They were having a little bit of a hassle.
  </li><li>I was sick all summer.
 I didn't even see them for like six weeks.
  </li><li>So we decided we're gonna do everything we can
 to make this summer really special.
 So between VBS and summer camps, just a big win, win, win.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>The bummer of it is the plan, at least in my head,
 'cause we dropped them off and picked them up,
 was that I would do the drop off,
 but I managed to get sick.
  </li><li>You did?
  </li><li>Yeah, just after a recording last week's episode,
 I came down with,
 I've been basically being in bed all week,
 except for yesterday.
 I finally went, it's not, I finally went and saw a doctor.
 By the time I could get him to see my GP,
 I was at the tail end of the thing,
 but basically I was in bed for six days.
 Just congestion, you know,
 just horrible.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But the fun thing was on Saturday.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I woke up and I thought,
 "I'm just gonna put some essential oils,
 "I'm gonna put some breeze on to open my airways."
 And when I put it on me,
 I couldn't smell any of it.
 I thought, "Well, that's weird."
 And I thought, "Well, maybe the oil, you know,
 "had just evaporated and so held up to like,
 "no, there's some oil in there."
 And so, you know, I'm full on huffing it
 and can't smell the things.
 I come through to you in the kitchen like,
 "Babe, can you smell this?"
 And you're like, "Yeah."
 And so we realize I've lost my sense of smell.
  </li><li>Yep.
 And my taste was muted.
 So I was like, are you kidding?
 'Cause I had about five or six COVID symptoms.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>Of course I'm fully vaccinated.
 But in one sense, that's great, but it doesn't--
  </li><li>You can still get it, yeah.
  </li><li>Exactly.
 So I went to a walking clinic, had two COVID tests,
 rapid tests, which came back negative,
 which the doctor humorously said, which means nothing.
 So let's take a PCR test.
 That turned out I was negative for COVID
 to find out the day later.
  </li><li>I don't get that though.
 Like why is there rapid tests
 if every medical person I've heard of--
  </li><li>'Cause if it comes back positive,
 it's unlikely to be a false positive,
 but it's often a false negative.
 So if it came back positive--
  </li><li>Yes, you have COVID.
  </li><li>Yeah, you have COVID.
  </li><li>But if it came back negative, not necessarily.
  </li><li>And I went in with that theory.
 Let's do the rapid test 'cause it'll tell us instantly.
 And if it tells us not, that's no guarantee.
 And so she said the same thing.
 But the next day, praise the Lord,
 my sense of smell came back, but I just felt crummy.
 And the weird thing was you ever have those moments
 where you feel like you have a fever,
 but you don't have a temperature.
 Do you ever have those where you feel like you're burning up?
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>Then you take your temperature and you don't?
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>Okay, well maybe it's unique to--
  </li><li>Your physique, your unique man-fluish physique.
  </li><li>Oh, come on now, are you throwing man-flu me?
 I was legitimately sick this week, wasn't I?
  </li><li>You were.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I don't know why I'm asking you,
 you're no more of a doctor than I am.
 (laughs)
 But yes, anyway, I wouldn't see my doctor yesterday
 and she gave me a shot in the butt of steroids.
  </li><li>Yeah, can I read the text that you sent me?
 'Cause I nearly peed myself, I laughed so hard
 at your little text. - Sure, yeah.
 Well, it depends which text it is that I sent you.
  </li><li>It's too late, you just gave me permission
 and so now stuff are the consequences.
 So you were there and you said,
 "Getting a steroid shot in the butt."
 And I said, "What did she say?
 She is our doctor and we love our doctor. She's amazing.
 She she's got a great sense of humor anyway. Alan texts back.
 She said I was very brave and then stabbed me in the butt with a steroid.
 Not my worst date ever.
 All things because the trouble is she did say to me yesterday,
 hey, the star shot might make you hyper, which typically does for like the first
 hour. You know what though? I wasn't even sad about that because I'm like,
 at least you'd be out of bed, you know?
 So it's all good.
  </li><li>You might have troubles falling asleep tonight.
 At 2.30, I was like, yeah, you think?
 So at 2.30, I took a Benadryl and that knocked me out.
  </li><li>Oh, good.
  </li><li>And I woke up today.
 So yeah, the week for me has been right off.
 It's been made slightly better by the fact
 that on Friday, Black Widow came out
 in theaters, which we didn't go to,
 but also on Disney+ which we rented.
  </li><li>And it was great, yeah.
  </li><li>Enjoyed that.
  </li><li>And tomorrow you're doing all the driving to camp.
 So that's so great.
 Well, I was also going to say, but you haven't seen it.
 And the finale of Loki came out last night,
 that me and Abby watched, but you didn't want to watch.
 Oh, yeah.
 I don't want to say anything, but I don't even
 want to say it's really good because I don't want to temper it.
 OK.
 But I'm eager to watch it with you tonight.
 Oh, all right.
 We could watch it tonight.
 All right.
 That's our weekly catch up.
 Anything else that happened?
 I don't think there's anything exciting that has happened.
 I always fear that something big has happened.
 And we've forgotten it.
 Or maybe some momentous occasion with friends.
 And you're like, seriously, you didn't even
 remember it was my birthday and we went to New York and yeah we haven't traveled we had
 staff fun day today and I tried my hand at cornhole hole cornhole corn oil cornhole
 cornhole and which isn't a game that any Canadian plays really I've I never saw the game till
 I moved on here so it's a people who might not be familiar with what cornhole is it's
 It's like a, it's a, it's a big board that's like low rent basketball.
 Okay.
 This tilted and has a hole in it and you stand across from it and try and
 throw beanbags into it.
 Uh, and it's, it is about as exciting as that sounds.
 Yeah.
 Uh, but I decided to try my hand at it.
 And how was it with your stitches?
 Well, um, it felt fine.
 Well, that's the only thing I was, I thought I'm not going to get too into this because I'm not going to risk.
 And that's probably why the only reason Tony was probably the only reason Tony went.
 It wasn't because he's played it a good, Gillian times and I played it like twice.
 But yeah, he he trumps me 13 to one.
 All right. Well, okay, let's see.
 How am I going to do this?
 I need a bigger text.
 I was giving you grief about it last week.
 We got so many questions.
 Okay.
 I've kind of grouped them by theme so we don't have them repeating.
 And I've prior to our members, because members get that sweet priority Q&amp;A.
 So again, we're talking about how do you maintain?
 How do you build healthy relationships?
 You all had so many good questions.
 This one's grouped into the heading audits because we talked last week about
 doing relationship audits.
 Yeah.
 So somebody said, how do you know when a friendship is over or just going through a
 hard time?
 How do you know when a friendship is over, just going through a hard time?
 You don't hear from them anymore.
 It's definitely over at that point.
 And I'm just kidding.
 I, I, I don't know.
 I think because we do relationships so like not so much in your face, but like
 there's lots of communication involved.
 I don't think I've ever faced not knowing if it's over.
 Does that make sense?
 It does make sense.
 I'm just trying to think about this person's question.
 How do you know when a friendship is over or just going through a hard time?
 So, so presumably it could be going through like what are the characteristics
 of relationships when they go through a hard time. Maybe it feels like a lot of work. Maybe
 this friction or misunderstanding communication.
 Yeah, maybe they're in a different season. There's less time spent, that kind of thing.
 I think it probably depends on how much you value the relationship on your end, how much
 you want to fight for it. And by fight for it, I mean both extend grace and have conversations
 that need to be had.
 Right. But also I'm thinking the answer to that question comes. I don't, I don't, this is going to
 sound pithy and I don't mean it to the answer to that question doesn't come by asking podcasts
 who soon know nothing about the relationship. It's by asking the person you're in a relationship with.
 Hey, where's our relationship? Like I can't tell whether we're just going through a hard time
 or whether our is our relationship coming to an end. Yeah, like asking those questions, which of
 course, based on the number of questions that I got asked about boundaries, is going to send a
 lot of you into paralysis. But the way out of a lot of unknown is to move forward with clarity.
 Yes.
 And clarity is often discovered by confrontation, by communication, by exploring that topic.
 And I think we mentioned last week that all relationships have a lifespan built into them.
 You know, relationships, ebb and flow for good and bad reasons. But I don't like to think of a
 relationship as over. Like that's like got a really final sense to it.
 Yeah, it might just be in a season where there's less contact or whatever.
 Yeah, on the back burner. Similar to that question, how do you not get discouraged?
 Or how do you handle it when your friends don't prioritize the relationship?
 I know sometimes relationships are for a season or maybe they just go through seasons.
 But my question is, do you keep trying? Do you just let it be what it is and use your energy
 going after the relationships that seem to be more mutual.
 Yes.
 To all of the above.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 I mean, I think unless like again, there's sometimes there's seasons where the Lord's like,
 hey, pour into this relationship, you're not going to get very much back.
 If that's what you're talking about, then you just keep pouring in and being faithful until the
 Lord tells you something different.
 But generally speaking, yeah, if you're the one that's extending all the energy and you don't feel
 feel like you're that's reciprocated,
 then I would say if you're talking about,
 this is one of the people that you're making up
 your friendship group with to fill that tank.
 Yeah, go for greener pastures where somebody's actually--
  </li><li>But would you go for greener pastures?
 You go confront the person first.
  </li><li>Well, I would probably let them know first.
 Like I would probably be like,
 "Hey, this isn't a pressure thing."
 But it just feels to me like, you know, pretty one-sided.
 So you just wanna let you know,
 I'm probably gonna effort this less if it's not,
 if it's, 'cause it's obviously not that something
 you wanna effort a whole bunch of.
  </li><li>And that's not punitive.
  </li><li>I keep still to say friends.
  </li><li>That's not threatening.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 But like, you know.
  </li><li>Most of the answers to our questions will be,
 we'll just go and speak to the person.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like so many of the questions are,
 how can I mind read this person more clearly
 without ever having to get my feelings hurt?
 Like you can't, all of the answers to your questions
 are on the other side of risk.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And sometimes like you putting in more effort
 and them putting in less effort might come down to definition.
 Like, you know, just different personality types
 and stuff they-- - Different communication styles.
  </li><li>Right, and different, like if you're talking
 in extrovert in an introvert.
  </li><li>Oh, this is where our firearms are now gonna self-test
 themselves, but we should be okay, keep going.
 Wow, we got a hiccup, we got a smoke detector.
  </li><li>Well, I'm just thinking like, you know,
 I'm sure that I have in different seasons,
 like when your kids are really, really little,
 there's definitely been friends that have been like,
 I don't feel like I see you anymore.
 And I'm like, yeah, 'cause I have three kids
 under the age of four.
  </li><li>Yeah, you're right, you don't see.
  </li><li>You don't, and it's not lack of wanting to be friends.
 It's not lack of effort.
 It is lack of energy and lack of time in the day.
 So there can be like any number of reasons
 why that is the scenario.
 And you're only gonna actually know that,
 not by mind reading because you can't,
 but by having the conversations.
  </li><li>Top tip, I've always loved the way you say scenario.
  </li><li>Okay, what's the other way of saying it?
  </li><li>No, I just love the way you--
  </li><li>Scenario.
  </li><li>I know, stop baby, stop.
 Yeah, how do you, I don't tend to get discouraged.
 I tend to just, you, well I might get discouraged,
 but I'll use that, you know, you sit with your anger
 or your hurt or your lonely to get to the gift, you know,
 so you find the wisdom to move forward.
 Or, you know, if you sit with your loneliness,
 it leads you to your intimacy or your desire for intimacy.
 Like, hey, yeah, you know, I need some clarity around that.
 All right, last question around the whole audit thing is,
 what about when you're the one that keeps reaching out
 to try to spend time with people to build relationships?
 And they seem to enjoy hanging out,
 but it's still you making it happen.
 Like, what do you do then?
  </li><li>I mean, again, you have a conversation.
 We're just gonna keep saying the same thing
 because that can come down to this person is not a planner
 and you are a planner.
 I mean, that could come down to any number of reasons
 why that's what it feels like to you.
  </li><li>The most common cause of broken relationships
 is communication related.
  </li><li>Yes, yeah.
  </li><li>And that's a great example.
 Like if you are a very planning oriented person,
 you think planning and your friend is super spontaneous,
 you could be receiving the way they live
 as a series of continual disrespect messages.
 Like how come they never call me to hang out?
 They literally don't think like you do.
 And that could be all that it is.
  </li><li>But it could also be somebody like me who I'm an uber planner.
 I have my whole life planned and I'm exhausted.
 And so I don't want to plan friendship.
 I want to just hang out when we can and I'm okay with that.
  </li><li>Yes.
 But the funniest thing is how many times over the years
 if we had people, usually people who don't know it's that well,
 sends a test going, "Hey, what are you doing tonight?
 Do you wanna hang out?"
 Or, "What are you doing on Friday night?"
 You're like, "My Friday night was scheduled three months ago."
  </li><li>Yeah, like, my life doesn't ever look like that.
  </li><li>And that can be odd.
 I mean, of course that sends odd to people
 who don't live a very structured planned life.
 So you can see why that's just gonna introduce communication.
  </li><li>Yeah, issues. - Issues, thank you.
 All right, that's audit questions.
 Here's some feelings related questions.
 How do you steward loneliness and let it lead you to the need it is pointing to
 and reconcile that with the truth that the Lord places the lonely in family?
 Do you mind if I take a stab? I think you should because yeah, I need more contemplation time.
 The underlying premise in this question is that those two things are are odds
 And that's a false understanding.
 So it seems like the person asking the question and saying,
 "Hey, you've taught us to sit with your lonely."
 And yeah, it also says that the Lord puts the lonely in family.
 So like, how do you live within those two tensions?
 There's no tension.
 When we sit with our loneliness,
 we listen to what our heart is trying to tell us.
 And our heart is trying to tell us, I need connection.
 That's the gift of lonely.
 It's pointing to the real need that every human has,
 which is connection.
 And by the way, the connection that the Lord gives us is great, but it's not enough for the way we were designed.
 See the Garden of Eden, right? God made everything good, and yet it's not right that man is alone.
 And he saw he built another human for him to have connection with.
 But that is so that when man gets a cold and needs every little thing brought to them in bed.
 Well, they've known.
 I have a medical certificate that I would brave.
 And a blue bandaid.
 You have a blue bandage, but I'm not sure you have a medical certificate because I certainly haven't seen it.
 Well, you can speak to Sam when you see her in a couple of weeks.
 Yeah.
 So I think the feeling of lonely and that verse God puts the lonely in families are just one and the same thing.
 Right. It's God answers lonely.
 Sit with your loneliness and it tells you what you need and it leads you to your next steps.
 Like, man, I feel really lonely with myself. I feel really lonely with God.
 God, I feel really lonely with age.
 I feel really lonely with Chris.
 It's telling you like, oh, I'm longing for intimacy with age.
 I'm long for intimacy with Chris.
 I'm long for intimacy and connection with myself or with God.
 And the promise that you have in scriptures is that yes,
 God sets the lonely in families.
 Like the cry of your heart is leading to you to the thing
 that God has already predetermined for you.
  </li><li>That you need.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>This is a beautiful question.
 How can you be vulnerable to build relationships and intimacy?
 Show them all your birthmarks.
 Just kidding.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Hey, do you know I've got three nipples?
 No, don't do that.
 But how do you do it?
 Like, you do it by doing it.
 And my encouragement is do it in baby steps.
  </li><li>Stages, yeah.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>Like not on your first meeting.
  </li><li>No, that would be terrifying, can you imagine?
  </li><li>But I've had that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I've had people come up to me and try and jump
 in the deep end of the pool.
 We're like, whoa.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You know, I'm not ready to get emotionally naked
 with you. This is so right. And it's different if you're talking about somebody sharing their
 life story with their pastor for help, but it were in these questions, we're talking about
 friendship. And I mean, I had a conversation like that a couple of months ago with somebody who was
 saying, Hey, I have so much stuff that's coming up for me right now personally, that I'm completely,
 they were sort of feeling really overwhelmed by even what they were trying to process with the
 the Lord in their like, so I can't be friends with anybody because, you know, this would
 be super overwhelming for anybody to listen to.
 And I'm like, are you saying that if you were to go out for coffee with someone, you'd
 have to tell them your whole life story to be able to feel like yourself having coffee
 or can you just go and have a normal conversation that doesn't involve burying all of everything
 you've ever suffered and let things build naturally?
 And she's like, Oh, yeah, I guess I could do that.
 You know, so.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think a good rule of thumb is that the things,
 now, I'm answering this question here.
 I'm not suggesting this is a rule of thumb
 with your closest of friends,
 but you're talking about like,
 how do you build vulnerability
 in order to build relationships?
 So you're talking about like,
 I don't already have this depth of relationship.
 My advice would be don't tell stories
 that are fresh or unresolved.
 Tell stories that are at least two years,
 you've got two years from victory.
 So like in terms of, you know, you talking about your past,
 talking about, you know, stuff that's precious to you,
 a good rule of thumb is there's two years of past
 since you've had victory in that area
 that you're beginning to open up.
 Now, don't misunderstand me.
 My closest friends are gonna hear real time
 about the crisis that's happening in my heart
 about what's going on.
 But I'm talking like if you're establishing
 a new relationship, you're building a new relationship,
 a good rule of thumb is two years.
 I also think though, just being you in the moment helps build
 vulnerability, because a lot of times we're like,
 okay, I'm gonna go out for coffee with this new person.
 And we either, you know, maybe you're actually tired
 and you actually got a phone call that's pretty upsetting
 and you're crying this afternoon and blah blah blah,
 but then you show up for coffee and you're like,
 hey, no, everything's good.
 And you know, and you're a super version of yourself.
 That's there's no reality in that at all.
 You know, as opposed to being able to go, Hey, I'm, I'm so excited.
 You know, I was really excited to meet with you today.
 I got some kind of not great news.
 Don't want to talk about it right now, but just letting you know, you know,
 I just feel a little bit subdued or, you know, I'm, I'm just kind of exhausted from
 the day, but I'm happy to be here, but I'm just letting you know, like even things
 like that build.
 I think that's beautiful, darling, because in that example, you're demonstrating
 care for yourself, which demonstrates you can be trusted.
 The other option is like, Oh, the high know, everything's fine.
 Is you caring for them?
 I don't want them to feel bad about my feelings.
 Yeah.
 Like when we're like that, we're actually demonstrating, Oh, if you can't be
 trusted with yourself, how can I trust you with myself?
 Right.
 If you can't be trusted with your own heart, how could you be trusted with my heart?
 Yeah.
 So, you know, how can you be vulnerable?
 It's like baby steps, practice vulnerability, practice being kind to yourself.
 Remember scripture says, love your neighbor as yourself.
 I've joked a lot of the time that there's lots of people I don't want to be neighbors to
 because I don't want to be loved.
 But just by the way I witnessed them love themselves, I'm like, oh, like, I don't
 want that major coming back on me.
 But I'm also thinking like this is this is a different kind of vulnerability, but
 this is something that we when we train people to preach and teach, we always tell
 them, Hey, teach from where you are.
 Like people are going to be able to tell if you're coming in again and being
 superhuman when actually you just had a really rough day or, you know, like people can register.
 There's not something, there's something that's not quite right there.
  </li><li>Limbic resonance. - Right.
  </li><li>That's a technical term for that. - Oh, thank you. So, you know, if you're coming in and you're like,
 "Man, it's been a tough week, but I'm going to bring this message to the look," that's,
 I would much rather meet that person than superhuman who doesn't ever have a bad week,
 and then gives me this message because- - Can I ask you about that?
 And maybe I'm asking our listeners about that is sometimes this could be my own judgment.
 Sometimes I either go to a church or I listen to a church message and the message is spectacular,
 but I don't believe what the preacher's selling. Not the content, but the delivery because of that
 very thing. I feel like the preacher's being a super self, a super version of themselves,
 because they think that's a more effective way of getting the message to me. But all I feel like
 like something inside me is not,
 there's nothing dark,
 try and only wrong with what they're saying,
 but it's not ringing my bell,
 because it feels inauthentic in the...
  </li><li>In the moment, or in the delivery.
  </li><li>And I've got no reason to not trust them.
 I don't even know them.
 And I'm wondering if that's the whole limbic residents
 could also be all my judgments, but...
 So I'm in a way, but then I look often
 at people who are loving it,
 and I'm like, do you have no discernment, or am I wrong?
 Like does any of that make sense?
  </li><li>No, it does.
 And I think some of it is,
 like I remember having a conversation with my friends
 that did Tehela with me.
  </li><li>You kind of costal friends.
  </li><li>And my kind of costal friends.
 And they were like,
 AJ, we're taught that in Bible college.
 Like we're taught, you can't have a bad day.
 And you present everything like you have no weaknesses,
 no problems, no whatever,
 everything has to be upbeat and breathless, you know.
 And, but that's what they were trained to do.
  </li><li>And clearly it works because there's lots of people
 in ministry who are doing that.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And people seem to love it.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So.
  </li><li>But I don't know if that's because that's what we are
 used to or what we expect or,
 'cause I know a lot of times like when people come
 to Gray Center or when people came to Toronto
 or whatever they be, so surprised by the vulnerability.
 And it's one of the things that we get on the school
 all the time, like, I'm so surprised by how vulnerable
 you guys are and how open you are about what you're going to.
  </li><li>We don't really know any other way.
 And we're like, why wouldn't we be?
 You know, because that gives you permission
 to be in process too, 'cause I'm in process, you know?
 But that's what I know.
 So that's why I'm like that.
  </li><li>And that's what I love about John and Carol and Jeff
 and hopefully ourselves as well,
 that we very much try to be the same people
 in the platform as we are off the platform.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Warts and all.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Good, bad and ugly.
 All right.
  </li><li>I don't have any warts, I just want to mention that.
  </li><li>Okay, that's great.
 Next topic of questions is all about questions around relationships and different seasons of life.
 Okay. This would be a great one for you to answer. How do you cultivate and maintain deep friendships
 in motherhood when you've got small kids?
 Um, when you got small kids, well, first of all, you give yourself a whole bunch of grace
 because with small kids, it's anything can happen. And anybody who has small kids will get it.
 and those who don't get it, they just don't get it.
 And you have to kind of go, all right,
 you know, when you have kids, you're gonna get it,
 and then you'll circle back with me,
 which has happened so many times,
 where, you know, where there's more recently,
 they, you know, they've had children and all of a sudden go,
 oh my gosh, I totally understand why you couldn't say yes
 to this or why, you know.
  </li><li>And you can't blame people for what they don't know.
  </li><li>Because, you know, at some point, I didn't know either.
 And I was that person that was like,
 I don't understand, we used to hang out.
 And now you're like, we never have time for me, you know.
 So one thing is being friends with other people in a similar
 season, because it's so easy to have grace. A. And there's
 something really lovely about just getting together with a
 couple other moms who all have little tiny kids and those
 little kids can run around together. And you all get it.
 Like you all get why that conversation took three times as
 long as you wanted it to, because one of you had to go
 rescue one child from the other or whatever, you know, and
 There's no judgment, there's no, you know,
 it's just all like, yay, this is our season.
 So I would say spend time with people in similar seasons.
  </li><li>Yup.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>That's not as fast.
  </li><li>Also, I mean, if you're hanging out with moms
 who have been there before, like I have tons of,
 I have friends who have littles, like really littles,
 and I have so much grace for them, 'cause I remember.
 I'm just like, yeah, sure, you need to cancel last minute,
 'cause they just bumped their head off the coffee table
 and that yeah, great.
 Like I'm good with that, I'm not gonna get offended,
 I'm not gonna, you know, never,
 'cause I get it, that's what the season looks like.
  </li><li>I bet I, again, going back to confrontational help
 with people who don't have young small kids,
 you explaining what life is like,
 or actually you making realistically clear
 your availability and what that looks like
 will actually help them have grace.
 Like I would love to hang out,
 but I'll be honest, that would look like you coming over
 and helping me fold laundry.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>We would do that.
  </li><li>We had friends that would do that.
 Come over and just help.
  </li><li>Yeah, we would just say,
 I would love to be with you.
 But it's gonna look like
 pepper pig is on in the background
 and our conversation is gonna be interrupted.
 That's the best I can do.
  </li><li>Yeah, or you can come over at nap time.
 I still need to be in the house.
 We're probably gonna have to be a little quieter
 and that'll be over whenever the child wakes up.
  </li><li>I would encourage you to lean into the healthy shame
 of the season.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>In that you have got new limitations
 that are outside of your control
 and that doesn't mean you're a bad mom.
 It just means that's the reality of the situation.
  </li><li>Does it make you a bad friend?
  </li><li>Also doesn't make you a bad friend.
 Lean into that limitation.
 I am a person with limitations and that's okay.
 Acts of service boy over there.
 I don't know if you can hear this
 'cause he's off microphone.
 Chris who's our producer is just like,
 "Hey, I've got a thought.
 "Chris is married but doesn't have children."
 And he's saying, "If you're in the reverse situation
 "where your friends with a couple
 "with a newly minted small child,
 "be proactive, don't ask what do you need
 because they need sleep.
 But be proactive and go, can I come over
 and do dishes with you?
 Can I come over and be with you?
 Can I come over and prepare a meal
 because I miss you would love to be with you
 and recognize the season of your life?
 Which is incredibly gracious and kind
 and proactive in your thinking.
  </li><li>Yeah, and it's also sewing into
 when you get into that season as well.
  </li><li>We had such a sweet, when we were in the school
 we always teach about so where you want to go.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And we were talking about that.
 So somebody asks us a question,
 when the students on the school ask us a question.
 And she was at a time an unmarried single mom.
 And she was hearing us talk about,
 when Ajay was unmarried,
 she would sew into marriages that she'd loved.
 She'd go over and babysit,
 she'd go over and clean houses,
 she'd go over and prepare meals.
 She'd go over and babysit so that her friends
 could go out and have a date night.
 'Cause Ajay was like,
 "I want to sew where I want to go."
 And so this person listened and heard that
 and was like, "I wanna do that for you."
 And so every Sunday, I mean, it was talked about humbling
 every Sunday.
  </li><li>Single mom with a baby.
  </li><li>Single mom with a baby would come over
 with a home-cooked meal for our family
 that she had prepared.
  </li><li>An amazing home-cooked meal.
  </li><li>And did that for months.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And it was hard for us to receive that help.
 'Cause she was like, "Oh my gosh."
 But it was the revelation that we'd taught
 and she's putting it into practice.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And now-- - Yeah, we struggled
 with saying yes to letting her do that.
 And then it was like, actually it's--
  </li><li>We didn't know about healthy shade, did we?
  </li><li>No, and she was like, I mean, she didn't say it
 in these words, but she was like,
 you're not gonna steal my blessing from me, are you?
  </li><li>And now she is married with how many children?
  </li><li>Oh, quite a few.
  </li><li>Expecting her like 19, I think.
  </li><li>No, I think she's expecting her, wait.
 It's either fifth or sixth, it's not funny,
 I can't remember.
  </li><li>It's a beautiful, beautiful story.
 All right, next question, kind of similar,
 but in another season of life,
 any tips for making friends later in life.
 I feel like after college,
 it's been so much harder for me to find people I connect with.
 I'm an introvert too,
 and going up to people I think I might like
 is a little terrifying.
 After all, they may not feel the same way about me,
 which feels like rejection,
 which feels like I knew I should have just kept to myself.
 The struggle is real, y'all.
 How can I put myself out there
 without coming across as a clown?
  </li><li>Oh, you have my question.
 I mean, we're both introverts.
 I'm probably more extroverted than you are,
 but certainly still greet the world as an introvert.
 And I would say, like I get what you're saying,
 I'm one of those people who, if I go into a room,
 I'm looking for the one person that I can connect with.
 I'm not trying to connect with everybody in the room.
 I feel intimidated, you know, all that kind of stuff.
 But I can remember, you know,
 particularly in sort of church things where you're like,
 I wanna, yeah, I wanna meet new people and I want,
 but this feels pretty overwhelming as an introvert.
 This is gonna sound stockish.
 I did a lot of standing in groups
 and listening to conversations and just sort of assessing
 like, oh, who feels safe to me?
 Who do I wanna risk saying, oh, tell me more about your story?
 Or I had a friend who was really good at asking questions
 And so I had gotten a little list of questions you could ask of people when you first meet
 them so that I, you know, that we're sort of non, um,
 Yes, no questions.
 Yes, not yes.
 No, open ended, but like non threatening, but be would be something that I would feel
 like, oh yeah, I could ask that.
 Like, oh, well, you know, tell me a little bit about where you're from or how you got
 here, you know, or whatever.
 so that it's like, oh, and then I could figure out,
 is this somebody want to keep having a conversation?
 You know what I mean?
 So I would say, I was generally speaking,
 I wasn't in a hurry.
 I did a lot more listening than talking
 and figured out some good questions to start asking.
 I don't know if that helps though.
  </li><li>I think it helps.
 I would also encourage this person to pray for favor.
 So like ask the Lord to give the people you want to be
 in relationship with, a gift of favor
 so that you have favor in their eyes.
 And the thing that you're talking about,
 like, I don't wanna actually risk looking like a clown,
 that will not go away.
 And the most beautiful thing to put yourself at pieces,
 you are a gift.
 And if other people can't recognize the gift in this season,
 that's okay, that's their loss, not yours.
 Like it's interesting that your story would be,
 oh God, I've just been rejected.
 I should have kept myself to myself.
 Perhaps a healthier narrative is,
 oh, I guess that's not for this season.
  </li><li>Or that's not my people.
  </li><li>Or that's not my people.
 Or, gosh, there must be something wrong with them
 that they can't recognize the gift that's in their midst.
 Right?
 But try creating a, not a healthier narrative,
 I don't wanna shame your narrative,
 but a narrative that is kinder to you.
 But I would go in and I would take baby steps.
 I would look for, pay attention to who you're drawn to
 because you're drawn to them for a reason.
 and then find casual ways, socially acceptable ways
 of inserting yourself into their life.
 So for example, you're at church,
 and you're in the coffee shop, go up and say hi to them.
 Like the power of introducing yourself is huge.
 And then see what is the reaction to like,
 "Hi, I'm Alan."
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like, "Hi, I've seen you around, what's your name?"
 Just like the simplest of baby steps
 where you're not gonna be rejected asking somebody
 what their name is or their story,
 like where did they come from or,
 Hey, but don't stay frozen in what if they reject me.
 And if they do reject you, it's not you.
  </li><li>Yeah, move on. - It's just move on.
  </li><li>There's other people.
 I was also thinking though of your thing
 where you used to sort of say to yourself,
 "Hey, you know, I'm amazing.
 "People like me.
 "Like I'm worthy of friendship, I'm worthy of being known."
 And sort of, I don't know if self talk is what I want to--
  </li><li>Well, I never said those things to me.
 That was a recurring dialogue in my head
 from as long as I can remember.
 Like my mom did something brilliant
 and instilling an incredible sense of self-esteem.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So I--
  </li><li>You would go in a room expecting people to like you.
  </li><li>All the time.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I'm confused when people don't.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Very confused.
  </li><li>When I don't have favor, it throws me for a second.
 Like, wow, what?
 You know, and then I've learned to kind of shrug that off
 and understand, okay, it's not a time, it's not a season.
 That's okay.
 So, but what I'm saying is, so that's a thing that your mom installed in you that you already
  </li><li>Yeah, everyone was badder for you being in it.
 Yeah, you already go into the room expecting, I'm gonna be wanted here.
 You know what I mean?
 Like I'm adding to the environment.
 I remember a friend of ours telling us a story of, she was going into her senior year of
 high school and she was feeling super nervous and she's probably a little bit more introverted
 or whatever.
 And she was thinking about how you had talked about, hey, my mindset is, hey, you want to
 to know me, like I'm a great person to know.
 And so she just determined,
 all right, I'm gonna go to this brand new high school
 in my senior year, and I'm gonna just keep thinking to myself,
 I'm amazing, you want to know me, I'm a gift.
  </li><li>And this person is amazing, if you need this person,
 they are amazing. - They are amazing.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Absolutely.
 And, but she like came home and was like,
 "I made friends the first day."
 You know, she's telling her mom.
 And that was a new experience for her.
 So I think also that like--
  </li><li>It's at some point we gotta understand
 that we can't be friends with everybody.
 That's an unrealistic expectation.
 Not everyone is gonna like your flavor and that's okay.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's great.
  </li><li>All right.
 How do you find time for friendships
 in busy seasons of life?
 Over to our busyness correspondent.
  </li><li>I don't know that I'm doing that well with it.
 I mean, I have some regularly scheduled friend time.
 Otherwise I probably wouldn't have much friend time
 because in the moment, most nights,
 once we're done working and potentially meeting people
 for dinner or doing whatever,
 my choice would be I'm going to bed.
  </li><li>That's the introvert.
  </li><li>It's 7.30.
 I'm run out of, I call it people juice,
 which sounds really gross, but like I've run out of
 energy I can spend on people and now I need to be completely by myself, you know, to, to survive.
 But I do have some like regularly scheduled.
 I meet my friend every Wednesday at this time, or I meet in.
 And so for me, that's been one of the things that I've historically done is
 I have regularly scheduled.
 So that would all come out of the friendship audit.
 In this season of my life, I'm going to prioritize the friends that energize me and give me life.
 Yes.
  </li><li>So I'm abandoning my other friends, but again,
 I'm a person with limitations back to healthy shame.
  </li><li>Yeah, and then I have spontaneous moments of like,
 oh, you know what?
 It's Friday, I have lots of energy.
 I feel like seeing a person.
 So then I'm like, oh, who would feel like life to me?
 So then I'll just text.
 And if they happen to be free, great.
 And if they're not, I'm not offended, it's all good.
 You know.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So I kind of do both.
  </li><li>And then remember that the other person
 is gonna have ebbs and flows as well
 in terms of like, you know, busy seasons of life.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But again, not to be crass,
 we tend to prioritize what's most important to us.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And that sounds really horrible.
 Like if you don't prioritize these friendships
 and they're not important to you, no.
 It's like with the ingredient list you have,
 with the limitations that you have of time, energy, money,
 like you're doing the best you can.
 Like if anybody's listening to this,
 the gift I would love to give you
 is an increased measure of being kind to yourself
 and understanding that your limitations
 don't mean you're broken.
 It means you're human.
 Embrace your limitations.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Yeah, I mean, just yes, absolutely agree with that.
 I'm just thinking like you're talking about priority.
 Always our priority is gonna be our family.
 And by our family, I mean, not only our kids,
 but you and I are our family.
 I'm also by myself and our family.
 You know what I mean?
 So it's those things coming into play first.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>If you're not.
  </li><li>It's pointless if we don't have anything
 to give of ourselves.
 If you're so drained because you didn't go to bed at 7.30.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But again, that comes out of boundaries.
 Like you can say no to being with your friends
 and going to bed at 7.30, having a bath
 and then just going to bed.
 So that tomorrow you've got more of yourself to give away.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And I also have some friends that I can literally go,
 "Hey, I'm still gonna meet you tonight.
 "I just need you to know I am trashed."
 So can we just like watch a TV show or, you know, whatever?
 And I mean, that's when, you know, kind of who you're maybe more who your people
 are. Cause those are usually the people that are like, yeah, totally, I'm with you.
 You know, let's just sit there and stare at something.
 We got a couple of questions about church ministry life and friendship.
 What tips do you have are not withdrawing from people when you're in full-time
 ministry. How do you keep balance and connection with people when you work with people all of the time?
 I guess we just answered that. Yes.
 Well, let's flesh that out because I understand that when we're talking to people, I know there's
 pastors who listen, there's leaders who listen, there's husbands and wives of pastors and leaders
 who are listening. In church cultures that are very different from grace and are like you're...
 Yeah, I mean, I've certainly heard...
  </li><li>Yeah, I've certainly heard, yes.
 I mean, we used to travel meeting with pastors.
 That's what we did for years.
  </li><li>And that's the number one reason
 we didn't want to be pastors.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Largely speaking.
  </li><li>But so many of them felt like,
 oh, I have to be friends with everybody who attends my church.
  </li><li>Two extremes.
  </li><li>And meet all of their needs.
 And I'm like, that's insane.
  </li><li>That's one extreme.
  </li><li>Or, you know, my friend, my panic also friends
 who were trained don't actually be friends
 with anybody in your congregation
 because, you know, then they'll know stuff about you.
 And I was like, wow, I'm so glad I didn't grow up in this either.
 You know what I mean?
 I suppose I don't view relationships with people that either I'm friends, good friends
 with a bunch of people I work with.
 But I would say that your friends, like you haven't picked friends, you haven't looked
 at like, do I want to be friends with this person based on the criteria or whether they
 do or do not go to my church?
 Absolutely not.
 You've picked one of your major criteria is this.
 this person going to be life to me or work to me.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 Cause I, I get to already work with people or on people or, you know, whatever.
 Uh, yeah.
 So my friends get to just be my friends.
 But the question is like, how do you, uh, what tips you have on not
 withdrawing from people when you're in full-time ministry?
 I, my, my advice to you would be you might need, like if the reason, I would
 ask, why do you need to withdraw?
 Like what is it about you or what is it about the people that you're
 pastoring that's causing you to want to have to withdraw?
 Because it could be that's wisdom.
 It could be you're in a very toxic environment.
 And it's actually not a healthy environment for you to be because I don't
 know, maybe your environment doesn't have a high value on inner healing or on
 powerful communication or brave communication.
 And it's just, you know, or right.
 But here's the thing, like we, every one of us, we all need people in our lives.
 we all need healthy, rich relationships.
 If you can't find that in the congregation that you're leading,
 that's okay.
 Like the Lord's highlighting some work for you to do,
 but also you're going to have to look to your left,
 to your right of your congregation to find some people.
 Because we need relationships.
 So either that's like other leaders from other churches,
 other friends from different areas of life.
 But what tips, I tell you the tips I have,
 I learned this really early on is,
 this was back in the days when we'd meet with lots of people
 pre-COVID, but I remember Jeff sickness down going, "Hey, every week you need to put in on your
 meeting schedule, not just people who need to meet with you, because that's always going to be a
 drain." That's not a derogatory statement, but when people come looking for wisdom or prayer,
 no matter how lovely that drains you, make sure on your week of meeting with somebody,
 there's somebody that you want to meet with for you, that you want to meet with them,
 because either they're going to encourage you, they're going to challenge you, they're going to lift
 you up and I never forgot that. And so that would be a tip. How do you keep
 balancing connection with people when you work with people all the time? Work out
 what your love language is. Like do you need quality time on your own? Are you an
 introvert or you an extrovert? How do you recharge? You know be kind to your heart
 remember you're no good to anybody dead. And have clear expectations that are
 clearly communicated. Yeah. And honestly work hard if you're a pastor leader work
 card on yourself with inner healing and then feed that into your culture so that
 your people get healthier. Yeah. Okay. Oh, I love this question. And now I feel bad.
 I said, I love it. But here's why I love it. Oh, dear. I'm afraid. Is it ever okay to end a
 relationship with church people? Yes. Yes, absolutely. Right. Church people don't get a
 pass like, well, you have to be friends with me because I got the same churches. You like
 That's insanity.
  </li><li>No, I don't.
  </li><li>Right, you end relationships with people period
 when it's become a place of toxicity or on health.
 On healthiness to you.
 Regardless of whether they go to church, right?
 So yes, simple.
 All right, this topic is all about questions
 that could easily fall under the category of boundaries.
 How can you develop healthy communication of boundaries
 at the beginning of a friendship
 to avoid awkward communication once the relationship has already developed.
 Without worrying that brave communication right at the beginning might scare them off.
 For example, if you've known someone for a while and they're used to letting,
 they're used to you letting them take control over you in some form, how could you avoid this happening?
 Okay, we're already in what I like to call dysfunction soup.
 Right.
 Okay, no, no, take it away boundaries.
 Boy, no offense to the person asking this question, but this question's got so many.
 It's like a boundaries lasagna.
 There's so many layers of dysfunction going on in here.
 We never want to purpose our communication to avoid future communication.
 Cause that's control manipulation.
 That's like, Hey, if I can communicate this now, then I want to have to need to communicate with you later.
 If we're always scared of communicating with a person we're going to be in
 relationship with, we probably want to evaluate why we're going to be in
 relationship with that person. Okay. If you're looking at this relationship,
 thinking I have to secure and lock down this relationship so that if it goes
 sideways later, I'm not caught out that probably not a relationship you want to
 begin with. So maybe step back and work out, is this even a relationship of health?
 But your question is like, how do you develop a healthy communication of
 boundaries in the first place without scaring them off? If clear
 communication scares off somebody. I don't want to be in
 relationship with them. I don't want to do relationship
 where clear communication is not a high priority.
 Right. But also I don't launch into a brand new relationship
 with all of my guidelines. I'm moving slowly into
 relationship anyway, establishing them. Yes. But if if I
 what I'm picking up on this person is, well, if I could do
 this now, then I won't have to do it later. Don't don't build
 with later in mind build with, you know, what you've got and
 where's the Holy Spirit leading you to?
 And then the ending part, like for example,
 if you've known someone for a while
 and they're used to you letting them take control over you,
 how can you avoid this from happening?
 You can avoid this from happening
 by redefining the relationship.
 Like, hey, I noticed that sometimes we go through seasons
 where I feel controlled by you.
 And as I was thinking about that,
 I'm realizing, oh, I've actually been complicit in that.
 So I wanna change that dynamic and we talk about it.
 That's how you would stop it happening from the future.
 Now, that one confrontation might blow up your relationship,
 but if that's a regular feature of the relationship,
 it doesn't sound like a relationship
 you wanna keep around.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>P.S., when I answer questions about boundaries,
 things get really clear and really blunt.
 And I'm sorry if I sound way too direct.
  </li><li>Yeah, but I also think that from the beginning,
 without, like you wouldn't have to meet with somebody
 for the first time and say, "Hey, glad we're talking
 "about being friends, just letting you know,
 not going to let you control me, not going to do this, not going to, I mean, that's never going to be
 healthy. But, but you train people how to treat you. Absolutely. From the very beginning.
 Yep. You know. So what if on that first meeting that person, because many of truth is told in
 jest, what happens if that person makes a joke about controlling you, confront that immediately?
 Yeah. Right. Yeah. Just like, Hey, let's talk about that. Because that language scares me. Yeah.
 Reflective listening, you know, so somebody makes a joke like oh well
 Well soon see like I tend to be quite controlling in relationships
 You tend to be quite controlling in relationships like just saying back what you heard
 Next question how do you protect someone's heart when you know they need to be challenged?
 Well, it's not your job to protect their heart
 But why but what if they get their feelings hurt but what if
 Just got a look of
 Exh aspiration well, I mean there's so I mean there's so much control in that statement like how do I protect their heart?
 Yes, not not your job. They get their feelings hurt
 They get their feelings hurt they get their heat feelings hurt
 But you can't have real relationship with anyone if you're assessing all the time
 Are they gonna be hurt if I tell them the truth?
 Right.
 You just can't.
 You know, you can't.
 So if your question is like, you know they need to be challenged and they've created an
 environment or you've willingly created a relationship where challenge is not allowed,
 that's a really scary relationship to me.
 Yeah.
 Terrifying.
 How do you protect their heart?
 You tell the truth in love.
 Like the truth may be hard, but it doesn't have to be harsh.
 Yeah.
 It doesn't have to be meanly said or anything.
 I'll often say, you know, if I hear something, I'll often say, "Hey," you know, like, let them
 finish saying what they're saying. Can I challenge you on something? Like, do you feel,
 can you go there with me right now? You know, sometimes they're like, "I really can't." Like,
 I just, I just shared something that was really difficult. And I don't feel like, you know,
 I can go there. Great. A key helpful phrase is, "Would you be open to some feedback?
 Because you're giving them permission.
 You're, or you're seeking permission.
 Would you be open to some feedback?
 Yeah.
 By then launch in.
 But you, you, you can't protect someone's heart.
 But I'm just thinking, I, I can think of some recent conversations that I've had where I've
 said, Hey, can I, I've used the word challenge, not feedback.
 You know, can I challenge you on something?
 And this person was like, I really don't feel like I have capacity for that right now.
 I'm like, great.
 You know, and then we met again, like a couple weeks later and I said, you know, how are
 you doing?
 They're talking about whatever.
 And that person actually said, I think I'm ready to talk about what you want to just challenge me on.
 And I'm like, all right.
 You know, and if they had NASA, I would ask them.
 You know, so it kind of depends on, you know, how big a thing we're talking about.
 Because.
 Yeah, if it's a body in a freezer, don't challenge them. Call 911.
 Okay. All right. Next question.
 And then run.
 I love this question too. How can I make a good first impression when making new friends?
 The reason I love this question is I'm so curious about all of the questions behind that question.
 I'm going to answer that question at face value and I would say the best way you can make a good
 first impression is to be yourself. I told a story last week about trying to make a good impression
 on like my friend was out with a friend of his that I really want to be a friend of mine but I
 didn't know this person had no in-road and so my attempt at making that in-road was thinking about
 What would this person most like me to be and then try and meet it?
 That's horrible.
 That's disastrous.
 And we were good discernment is going to see that coming at 50
 paces and not, you know, not, not what, not be interested.
 The best version of you is the most authentic version of you.
 So how do you make a good version of pressure?
 Be yourself.
 Like again, you're not auditioning for friendship.
 You're showing up and you're actually trusting that God's going to bring the
 people that he's already prepared for you to be in relationship with.
 And that's my thinking.
 I would also say, if it seems like, gosh, I generally don't make a great first impression,
 I'd be asking the Holy Spirit why, like, well, because probably you have some sort of protection
 mechanism in place that is the reason you experience not making a good first impression.
 And that can be anything from a conversational style to,
 like I remember us having a conversation
 with somebody a number of years ago that was like,
 why don't people ever wanna just like, you know,
 be my friend, but almost everything about
 what, even what they wore, how they did their hair,
 that they didn't brush their teeth, all that.
 And I'm like, you are, you're in many ways,
 protecting yourself over time
 from anybody ever wanting to get close to you.
 But then you're experiencing the result of that
 and you don't seem to realize there's things
 that you could stop doing on a practical level
 if you were willing to have the conversation
 with the Lord about, hey, is,
 and again, I think this is for more extreme situations
 where it's like, oh, I just never seem to be able to
 connect or meet people well.
 I would be going, oh, I'm gonna go get some ministry
 around that, I'm gonna see where I might have, you know, my porcupine quills out ready to
 make sure nobody tries to draw near me. And those might be visual and they might not.
 Well, see, we're the sad realities. We're often the last people who know how we're being
 experienced. Yes. Yeah. And so the desire to connect could be there, but there could be
 a deeper desire to not be seen. And that's working against you. And you don't even know
 it's there. So again, ministry asking for, you know, feedback or input would be great.
 This section is all about tribalism. So many of us are yearning for community. How do you find your tribe?
 Do you have an answer for that? I'm like, how do you find your tribe? I mean,
 I guess I do it by feeling that they're like me.
 And they're probably, I'm probably going to find them
 in environments that I most want to be in.
 So the majority of my tribe, I have found in the kind
 of church environment that I want to be in
 and that feel most like me or most like they're looking
 for the same things I'm looking for.
  </li><li>Or they're heading in the direction of the direction
 I wanna be in. - Yeah.
 Okay, that's a great, great answer. Like, you know, you talked about a church environment.
 Let me ask a follow-up question about that. So now you're in a church and the church
 largely is heading the direction you like and it's a church filled with people
 that have obviously got a shared value for the same values of the church.
 Within that, like, how do you find your tribe? This person has this question.
 How do you combat cliques? Cliques? Cliques? I don't know which one.
 and live out community with inclusion and inclusiveness.
 Well, I mean, so we were talking about this earlier and I think, I don't think
 I've ever been in a click, but I'm sure other people would say, yes, your
 friendship group is a little click or, you know, whatever.
 So when you're in the middle of them, you probably don't realize.
 Well, that's what, but I mean, but that just says that this is a group of
 friends who've already established relationship and you want in, and you're
 feeling, you know, threatened by that or sad about that or, or whatnot.
 So the question is how do you what combat it?
 Yeah, how do you combat clicks and live out community with inclusion
 inclusiveness?
 Well, it comes back to faulty premise because not all relationships are
 about inclusion because you can't have a relationship with everybody.
 It can't be friends with everybody.
 You know, I've only got one wife.
 Like I'm not living my marriage with a view to inclusion or inclusiveness.
 It's an exclusive relationship.
 Right.
 And so clicks are invisible.
 Clicks are only visible to people who aren't in it.
 And the irony is the people who are going like that's a click are themselves
 in a click that they are not aware of.
 Right.
 So all of us have little friendship groups, you know, that we function within.
 And to the person on the outside, that probably looks like a click, but it's,
 is it is a functional group because we're designed to live in community.
 Mm hmm. So that's really hard though. When you're, you've entered the larger group,
 the larger tribe, but you're wanting to get connected, like how do you do that? I think,
 again, it's praying for favor that God would connect you with the people that you're supposed
 to be connected and not writing a story when it's not with the people that you quote unquote,
 want it to be. Yeah. Because usually the people you wanted to be with is a story you've written in
 in your heart about how that's gonna turn out
 rather than reality.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
 And also, I think be patient.
 Relationship, good relationship takes time.
 So if you're like, will I just arrived here?
 And I've discovered that this is the cool click over there.
 And I want to, now I'm gonna try and infiltrate
 the cool click and it hasn't worked out well for me.
 So I'm gonna go to a new church.
 Just sort of like, oh, there's nothing healthy
 about anything in that scenario.
 Right. Right. So what if you just went and determined to be known by people and see who the Lord brings?
 Okay. Similar question. How important is building new relationships when you found your people and don't really want to get more?
 I love that. I think I definitely have seasons where I'm like, I don't, I am happy with the people that I'm friends with. I don't feel a deficit.
 However, I think if I'd had that attitude all the way through,
 I would have missed out on some of the friends that I now have.
 You know, because I haven't felt a friendship deficit, but I'm so thankful
 for even the new friends that I have that I didn't have a couple of years ago.
 It's all about living with an open hand.
 Yeah.
 I mean, the Lord gives and the Lord takes away.
 Yeah.
 So it's like living with an open hand, like, you know, Lord, my life is yours to steward.
 And I don't know who's going to be coming my way.
 I'm sorry, like I'm not looking for new friends.
 I'm not like feeling a deficit.
 My friendship, that's the other thing.
 Like people have a confusion that like a friendship is something to be auditioned for.
 And if you didn't get the part then somehow you felt like that's just literally not how
 relationships work.
 And yet somehow like a lot of the conversations I've had with people
 are along those lines.
 It's like, look, be, get so full up with the goodness of God.
 It live out of the joy of who you are and who he's created you to be.
 And you will attract other people who want to get to know the value and the
 worth that's in you.
 Yeah.
 And you can't find your value and your worth in the people who want to be
 friends with you.
 Yeah.
 That's just going to end up in one big narcissistic pileup that is just not
 going to be healthy at all.
 Yeah.
 I'm looking at this list and I'm looking at our clock and I'm realizing, man,
 I maybe got through three quarters of the questions.
 Okay. And we have to go pick up our kids.
 We have to go pick up our kids.
