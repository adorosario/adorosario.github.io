<p> Mrs Jones how are you.<br/>
 Oh that's right you're not here to answer my question because you're out shopping at
 Target.<br/>
 Welcome to a very special edition of Keeping Up With The Joneses.
 AJ is currently out at Target shopping for some good because tomorrow we will hop on
 a plane and spend all day flying and eventually fly through the night and land in Edinburgh
 on Sunday morning so if you could pray backwards in time for grace and patience we would much
 appreciate that.<br/>
 We're in Scotland this week to be with my family.
 of you already know that my mother has been battling cancer and so we've just come over
 with the kids to support her. Because we're spending most of our time on an airplane this
 weekend, it's not really feasible for us to record a podcast. However, Lyle B. Phillips,
 who was with us last week, did such a phenomenal job of telling amazing stories. We had a
 cut out a bunch of the funny stuff to leave the serious stuff in. And so we put together
 a compilation of some of the best bits we had to cut out last week from Lyle.
 Enjoy the teaching and we'll be back to a regular schedule as soon as possible.
 AJ sends her love all the way from Target.

 Wow, never heard of it.<br/>
 Sounds deep.<br/>
 It is good.<br/>
 Yeah, just finished it last album bought.
 Well, we just bought we will not be shaken by Bethel.
 Come on.<br/>
 Last movie watched.<br/>
 What was the last movie I've watched?<br/>
 Man, this is tough.<br/>
 I have no idea you guys.
</p><ul>
  <li>Okay. - I'm so sorry.
  </li><li>That's fine.
 You're so godly you probably don't visit that.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 No, I love the movies, but my wife does not.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>Yep, I love the movies.
 Like I would go buy myself.
  </li><li>You know what I love?
 I love going to movies.
 You know what I hate being in the movies with other people.
  </li><li>Really?
 I just want to run out the movie for myself.
 I don't want people talking or you can pop corn
 or on their cell phones.
 Like the only time I moved to physical violence
 is when I'm in the movie theater.
 and there's people around me.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>He'll turn around and ask people to be quiet.
  </li><li>I can, I believe it.
  </li><li>I can, I can, to be quiet.
  </li><li>I believe that Alan Jones would do that.
 Anytime I feel like I need to pull up
 my courageous, confrontational thing in public,
 I'm like, what would Alan do?
 (laughing)
 Seriously.
  </li><li>Seriously?
  </li><li>Last restaurant you ate at?
  </li><li>Man, I was at a restaurant the other night.
 It was a Mexican restaurant.
 That's a last restaurant.
 It's called Mexicali.
 It's not far from here.
 It's cool springs.
  </li><li>Last purchase of anything.
 of anything, last purchase.
  </li><li>Your bank statement, what does it say?
  </li><li>Yep, I bought a Starbucks coffee
 on the way over here, shame, shame.
 But just before that, which for those guys out there
 who are into fashion, I bought a jacket
 from a store called Killian.
 It's like Million but with a K.
 They are a small company out of Los Angeles.
 They make one of a kind products
 and they do small batches.
 So you're guaranteed to never see anybody wearing
 what you're wearing unless they know about the site.
 So.
  </li><li>But now you've just told thousands of people
 potentially about this.
  </li><li>It's okay because the chances of everybody being able
 to purchase something's very slim,
 'cause you have to get log on when they do the drop,
 and you only have about five minutes to buy the clothes.
 So it's super exclusive, but it's also extremely cheap
 because their whole thing is like fair prices.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Yeah, so Killian.
  </li><li>Killian.
  </li><li>All right, I'm joining.
 Last Bible verse you read.
  </li><li>Had to have been proverbs because I do a daily reader,
 a one year Bible.
  </li><li>All right, last sermon you heard.
  </li><li>Sermon by Brian Zond.
  </li><li>Good.
  </li><li>And it was awesome.
  </li><li>Was it?
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
  </li><li>I don't know who that is.
  </li><li>He's amazing.
 He is a pastor in St. Joseph's, Missouri.
  </li><li>Can we just finish with the story of how you got Heidi
 to put in a good word for you from the mic at Bethel
 so that Alison would like--
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>Wait, I need to set this one up.
 Sure, go for it.
  </li><li>So the first time I ever met Lyle Phillips
 was actually with Heidi Baker.
 So Heidi Baker was at Grace Center.
 We love Heidi whenever Heidi's in town.
 She's a very gracious, always comes to Grace Center.
 And she's ministering.
 And whenever Heidi comes as usually an entourage,
 there's a real entourage of people who are with her.
 And then there's kind of followers of people
 who want to be with her.
 And so we're in the back room.
 And so there's Heidi and Pam Lantone
 who helped run the school out in Mozambique.
 And here's this really well-dressed guy
 who is just kind of looking around,
 not quite sure what he's doing,
 but he is impeccable,
 like his whole appearance is just absolutely impeccable.
  </li><li>I love it.
  </li><li>That's straight out of GQ.
 And so, you know, I just said,
 hi, how are you?
 Like, I'm Alan, he said, hi, I'm Lyle,
 and you know, I'm nice to meet you.
 And we didn't say much more than that.
 And then--
  </li><li>I was living in Kentucky at the time.
  </li><li>So you just come through for that?
 Do you mean to Grey Center before?
  </li><li>Nope.
  </li><li>That was the first time.
  </li><li>First time at Grey Center.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So that would explain your days in Confused Look.
 Yeah. And so, you know, worship begins and, you know, Heidi's a mess and Heidi gets up to speak.
 And pretty much the first thing Heidi can say as soon as she's led, you know, intelligible is,
 I want to introduce you to my hero, Lyle Phillips. And you've got 700 people in the room who are
 all like, who's Heidi, who's Heidi Baker's hero? And they're all looking at you. And I've heard her say
 that a lot. What does that do to your heart, knowing that you're Heidi Baker's hero?
 Well, I mean, she's my mom.
 So it's not really any different than my natural mother
 saying it.
 Like, I love you.
 You're my hero.
 You're doing a good job.
 Right.
 So yeah, I don't--
 But to everybody else, that's a glowing endorsement.
 Yeah.
 It is, I'm very honored.
 A fact to which I'm leveraged to get one of the hottest
 women in the planet to marry you.
 That is true.
 Oh, oh, that was the story.
 That is very, very, very true.
  </li><li>Is it Alice's story of how you leverage quite righteously
 your inheritance as a son of Heidi Baker?
  </li><li>I absolutely did this.
 (laughing)
 So basically when Alice and I first began talking,
 she was dating somebody else, kind of, like not really
 but she was still interested in another guy
 and he was in ministry and he was pretty well known.
 So I had to live up to his standard
 for all of her friends' sake.
  </li><li>And they don't know what's coming.
  </li><li>No, they had no idea who I was.
 All they knew was that I was this guy from the South
 who had a cowboy Southern accent
 and that was trying to get their friend, you know.
  </li><li>Get your friend.
  </li><li>Get their friend.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Get their friend.
 And so yeah, basically they didn't like me.
 Allison's friends didn't really like me at first.
  </li><li>And my best friend.
  </li><li>Yes. - Allison's a Bethel
 in writing California.
  </li><li>Yeah, she's at BSSM second year.
 She's doing their school.
 Yep, she had this old boyfriend.
 She was in ministry.
 Well connected, everybody loves her.
 She was staying there for third year.
 And then all of a sudden there's this guy
 who is a pastor in Tennessee in Nashville, her hometown.
 But from Kentucky.
 But from Kentucky.
 So is everything good come out of Kentucky?
 Exactly.
 Yeah, they're like, he's not cool.
 Right.
 And so basically I went out there for the first time
 and I felt so awkward,
 but because I could tell her friends really didn't like me.
 And I was like, this is so wrong.
 Like I'm nice.
 Like you should like me, I promise, I'm cool.
 Like just give me a chance.
 Like I'm a good guy.
  </li><li>That's the worst feeling, isn't it?
  </li><li>Oh, it is the worst.
  </li><li>Being misunderstood.
  </li><li>And I'm naturally competitive.
 So I'm like, I will show you I'm nice.
 Like I have to prove to you I'm good.
 So what I did was I left Reading that first time
 and I could feel the apprehension of our friends.
 So I thought, you know what?
 I know what I'll do.
 I'll just call momma Heidi.
 And I actually text her.
 I said, hey, when is the next time
 that you're teaching at BSSM and Reading?
 because when you're teaching out there the next time,
 I'm gonna come see you.
 And so she said, oh, it's on these dates,
 which was like a month and a half away.
 So basically--
  </li><li>Did you tell her the plan?
  </li><li>No. - Heidi knows nothing.
  </li><li>No. - No.
 So you just say, I wanna come see you.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Okay.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And so I text Allison and I said,
 "Hey, I'm gonna come back to Reading
 "and I'm gonna come out and see you in a month and a half."
 So I did, and I made sure I was there that day
 that Heidi was speaking in the school.
  </li><li>And is Allison interested in you at this point?
 Or is she being swayed by her friends?
 No, no, we're like dating.
  </li><li>You're dating.
  </li><li>Yeah, but she's trying to sway her friends.
 Like come on guys, give him a chance.
 Like he's a nice dude, you know?
 And so I was like, yeah, I'll be there on this day
 or whatever.
 So I show up and I text Heidi that morning.
 I said, hey, I'm gonna be at school supernatural ministry.
 She said, great, I'll be there at 11,
 meet me in the parking lot.
 So I meet her in the parking lot, we walk in together
 and share is there, my friend, share.
 And she's like, hey, I got you
 and your girlfriend two seats right next to Heidi
 in the front, in front of the whole school.
 I'm like, I knew I would prove it.
 I'm a good guy, they're gonna like me.
 And then just as before, you know, at Grace Center,
 Heidi gets up and there's second year, BSSM.
 And she's like, I'm so glad to have Lyle here.
 He's my son, he's my hero.
 And then of course, I win the affection
 of all of her friends.
 (laughing)
 And I'm like, that's right, I told y'all.
 I've anointed two.
 Give me a sweet tea.
 Yeah, exactly.
 Yeah, exactly.
 That's awesome.
 Yeah.
 It is amazing, isn't it?
 We're both blessed with incredible parents
 and an actual.
 I've met your parents.
 They're amazing.
 They are.
 You haven't met my parents, but they are amazing.
 They are amazing.
 But also in the spiritual world,
 blessed with incredible parents.
 We've got John and Carol.
 You've got Roland and Heidi.
 And it's funny.
 You can't make that happen.
 Nope. And yet it does. And the only thing you can do is just thank God for favor.
 Yeah. Mm-hmm. I don't know how it happened. It's weird, actually.
 But you know what I believe? I believe that it is very possible to have spiritual parents.
 You have to pursue them. You can choose them. But here's my belief. Okay.
 that you find out what they're dreaming about and help them do it.
 Yeah, absolutely.
 That's sonship.
 Get underneath and push up.
 We're just being some friends this week who are going to remain
 nameless because we're going to talk about them later.
 Sure.
 They just they were talking about their journey and they just said, I just
 realized I didn't have a vision for my life.
 But I found someone who did.
 And I thought, well, I don't have a vision for my life.
 So I'll just serve yours.
 and in serving this other person's vision they got their own vision come on and i think that's amazing
 find people whose vision you want to serve and serve it to get your own absolutely i fully
 agree with that i mean i tell people all the time serve before you deserve you're so proud of that
 i love those rhyming things right it's my rap career now gary morgan he's like funk master
 flex. Like he has his own rhymes and everything has a hashtag. Yeah. He's amazing. He's a
 hashtag master. He is a hashtag master. He probably has some of the best one liners as anybody.
 And it's unfortunate that more people do not follow Gary Morgan on social media. You need to
 follow Welsh Eagle. Yes, you need to. He's full of the goods. You know, we need to get Welsh Eagle
 on the podcast. Yeah, we do. Because he's got some crazy stories. He's so prolific and revelatory
 that from the first time I've heard him speak, I was just, I was one over.
 He's amazing.
 You know, when I was getting ordained, my grandmother tripped on the stairs
 and closed line, my fiance.
 And all Heidi said was, bless her Lord.
 My grandmother's six, three and weighs 275 pounds.
 Oh my goodness.
 Let me guess.
 She didn't drink a glass of water in her life.
  </li><li>It's only my move.
  </li><li>No, she drinks water probably.
  </li><li>And Allison's tiny.
  </li><li>Oh, she just (laughs)
 and everybody just--
  </li><li>I'm not laughing at your pain, Allison.
 I promise I'm not.
 It was the visual.
  </li><li>Oh, it was the best.
 We should include that in the show notes,
 like a vine format, like six seconds,
 'cause you can see it.
  </li><li>Let's do it.
  </li><li>Yes, I'll find it.
  </li><li>I was good.
  </li><li>I was good.
</li></ul>
