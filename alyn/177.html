 You did a great job singing.<br/>
 What are you excited about tonight?<br/>
 Uh, well, daddy's having a sweet purpose.

 In case I get super scared, I could tell mom scared about.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Do you know the other reason Daddy's doing sleepover with you?
 No.<br/>
 Mommy's sick and Daddy doesn't want to sleep next to her.
 Because... because Dad you would get sick.
 And I don't want to get sick.<br/>
 And while you work...<br/>
 Hmm...<br/>
 I don't want Mommy to go to your abbey right now.
 Those little old kids but I know there's one more kid.

 Yeah, that's exactly what I thought.<br/>
 So as you can tell from my sweet little co-host, my regular co-host, my wonderful delightful wife, isn't bad, sick, which is sad because we're going to do an end of the year review.
 But I've tried my best. She just won't get out of bed. She's stubborn like that. So sweet little MJ joined me for the introduction. He's off to bed.
 Thank you to everybody who's been listening this year, whether you're a regular or whether you found us in 2017.
 It's been our privilege to spend time with you each week.
 When you listen, thank you for listening to us.
 We hope you have an incredible Christmas, a wonderful new year.
 We didn't want to leave you empty handed, however.
 So we've included a message that I spoke at Grace Center a couple of weeks ago,
 all about dreams, how I started dreaming.
 If this is something that interests you, you can listen to part two as well.
 Put a link in the show notes where you can go listen to the rest of the message.
 It was a two part series.<br/>
 But for now, enjoy the message.<br/>
 We pray you have an incredible Christmas and new year.
 and we will be back in the start of the new year.
 Our first show of the year should be 8th of January, 2018.
 Until then, we pray you have an incredible restful season.
 Thanks again for listening.<br/>
<strong>[APPLAUSE]</strong><br/>
 You guys are very gracious when you have a seat.
 Let's pray and ask for the annoying thing
 that he spoke of to rest upon me, because no pressure, huh?
 Now, I'm excited to hear what I have to say.
 I do wonder if we could pray before we begin.
 not only for a blessing on the word, but also to bless our pastor. I mean, being sick is
 never fun, but being sick on vacation just feels like you're being robbed and I hate
 it. I got some inside details and I wish I hadn't. So Lord Jesus, we just lift up Jeff
 this morning. We just thank you for him. We ask that your supernatural healing power would
 go into his body today. Lord, that we would see a huge turnaround, that he would be healed,
 Lord that he would be absolutely restored. We remember others in our family, in our church
 body this morning who are also sick. Lord, ask for your tremendous power that we love to proclaim,
 that we love to preach, that we declare that we've seen it work so often in our midst.
 We ask for your power and your grace to be upon them. And be with us this morning, Lord. Would you
 feed us? Would you nourish us? Would we go home truly engaged, feeling like we've encountered you
 this morning. Now would you feed us from your word this morning? Amen. Well it's great to be here
 even under difficult circumstances. I forgot to pray for Becky as well because how many of you
 mothers, how many of you wives know when your husband is sick?
 Finish the sentence. Okay so if you've got your favorite Bible app with you, would you open it
 and would you scroll to Matthew, please, the book of Matthew? We're going to read from Matthew
 chapter one. If you're using one of those analog versions of the Bible, be careful you'll get a
 paper cut with those things. Just go slowly. Matthew chapter one, I'm asking this morning that
 the Lord would give us something this morning. I know that He will because He's very, very faithful
 like that. But I've been meditating the last couple of weeks about the simplicity of growth and
 and acceleration in their life, spiritual and others,
 and that whatever you wanna grow in, you need to feed.
 All right, so if we wanna be healthier,
 we actually have to give our attention
 to areas of health.<br/>
 If we wanna sleep better, we need to give our attention
 to that.<br/>
 If we wanna learn something, we need to give our attention
 to whatever it is we wanna learn.<br/>
 Attention is one of the most important currencies in life.
 What you give attention to brings growth.
 And so, you know, at church, if we preach salvation,
 we see salvation.<br/>
 If we teach on healing, we see people get healed.
 If we teach on generosity, we become generous people.
 And so this morning, what I'm asking is that
 as we read a passage together,<br/>
 that the Lord would give us something<br/>
 that we'd go home with something<br/>
 very, very practical this morning.<br/>
 So we're gonna read this passage.<br/>
 It's a passage we typically only read at Christmastime,
 but we've already had Thanksgiving,<br/>
 so bring on Christmas.<br/>
 Here we go.<br/>
 We're gonna read together Matthew chapter one,
 starting in verse 18.<br/>
 This is how Jesus, the Messiah, was born.
 His mother Mary was engaged to be married to Joseph.
 But before the marriage took place,<br/>
 while she was still a virgin,<br/>
 she became pregnant through the power<br/>
 of the Holy Spirit.<br/>
 Try explaining that one.<br/>
 Joseph, to whom she was engaged,<br/>
 was a righteous man and did not want<br/>
 to disgrace her publicly.<br/>
 So he decided to break the engagement quietly.
 As he considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream.
 Joseph, son of David, the angel said, "Do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for
 the child within her was conceived by the Holy Spirit, and she will have a son, your
 to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."
 So we read this short passage.<br/>
 We know that Mary is pregnant.<br/>
 We know that Joseph is like, "This does not look too good, but the Lord gives him a
 dream."<br/>
 And in this dream, an angel comes to him and basically gives him a heavenly perspective
 of the earthly situation he finds himself in.
 This morning, I want to teach not only about the Lord's value on dreams, I want us to be
 inspired to value them too.<br/>
 And to actually ask the Lord for an increase of them in our lives.
 It is no exaggeration to say that in the passage that we read this morning, is my screen
 not on guys. It's a shame. I've got a beautiful font this morning and you'd be robbed with
 that beautiful typography. There you go. So it would be no exaggeration to say that without
 a dream happening that Jesus would have grown up in a completely different family environment.
 What do you suppose may have happened if Joseph did not acknowledge that it was the Lord speaking
 to him in a dream. What if Joseph was just like, "Man, I don't know. I'm so anxious,
 and I'm so tense, and it's probably just all my emotions speaking to me." What would
 happen? Well, praise God. He didn't think like that. He took the dream seriously, and
 as a result, he ended up with a privilege of raising the Savior of the world. But what
 about once Jesus was born, how did God keep him safe? Let's continue with the story that
 we know. You know the story. Herod hears about the wise man come to celebrate the birth of
 this king. Herod gets super jealous, so sends out this edict to kill off all male children
 under two years old. So Jesus' life is in danger. So what do we do? No problem. He's
 the son of God, right? God will just send one of those big angels with a big flashing
 sword? No? Well, you know, what about like fire or a hedge of protection? What about
 him just rapturing him out with there and then sending him back once Herod's gone? What
 about one of those crazy four beasts in Revelation of eyeballs all over them? Send one of them
 down, that would freak out anybody. Hey, I'm here to kill any boys under two anyway.
 I just go in and you're like, "Oh, good God, what is that?"
 It's a big eagle with like, instead of feathers, eyeballs everywhere.
 But no, what does the Lord use as a means to save his son from certain death?
 Another dream.<br/>
 Let's read that.<br/>
 It's Matthew chapter 2, verse 13.<br/>
 It says, "This an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream.
 Get up, flee to Egypt with the child and his mother."
 And the angel said, "Stay there until I tell you to return because Herod is going
 a search for the child to kill him. Again, what if Joseph woke up that morning and was like,
 "Oh, that's a bad hummus. I mean, that is just a crazy dream. I believe what happened last night."
 But no, he took that as the word of the Lord. Look what it says that night. Joseph left for Egypt
 with a child and Mary his mother, and they stayed there until Herod's death. If you keep reading,
 you find that the Lord gave Joseph a third dream that went to leave Egypt and come back. What's
 funny about that is in the second dream, the angel says, "Hey, I'm going to come back again
 and tell you want to leave." Kind of weird, isn't it? No? Is everybody okay this morning?
 Can we have the ushers just pass out just shots of espresso?
 We'll just do that and see what happens.
 In the church that I grew up, if you came and said to us, "Hey, God spoke to me,"
 we'd have a very narrow grid of understanding of what that meant. We'd be like, "Oh, did you
 listen to an inspired teaching series?" Like, a sermon? That's our grid. If you said, "No, no,
 God spoke to me in a dream," we would just politely take a step away back from you because
 maybe you're contagious, right? Maybe you're a new age-er. We had no grid for the concept
 that God would speak through a dream. We only had a grid that God would speak through the word.
 Despite the word being filled with God speaking to people through dreams,
 we didn't see that. So, you know, the Bible was up here, dreams in Weirdoville, right? We had no
 grid for that. And yet God, who values his word above his name, didn't use a scripture to save
 a son. He used a dream. Now he could have used a verse like Isaiah 11 1, where it says,
 "I called my son out of Egypt." It could have been that Joseph and Mary got a synagogue
 and the reading that week is from Hosea. And Joseph has listened to that system. "Hey,
 I just really felt convicted by the Holy Spirit through the preaching of the Word that we
 need to go because Scripture says, 'I call my son out of Egypt and we know this is God's
 son and so we need to be in Egypt for him to become. We should go.' And yeah, he didn't.
 He uses a dream.<br/>
 Apparently, God didn't share the views of my church culture.
 (audience laughing)<br/>
 It's a wake up call when that happens, isn't it?
 (audience laughing)<br/>
 He used a dream to save his son's life.
 The safety of his son hung in the balance
 of something God values tremendously,<br/>
 and it's our dream life.<br/>
 If you read the first two chapters of the New Testament,
 read the first two chapters of Matthew, you find that the Lord directed the lives of people
 by speaking to them in dreams. Five dreams are recorded in the first two chapters of the book.
 Here's the thing, if we want to be people who hear God speak, we have to value the way he loves to
 speak. My journey into hearing the voice of the Lord was one of intense frustration, because what
 I didn't realize that I was demanding that he speak the way I hear rather than I have
 to learn to hear the way he speaks.<br/>
 It started me on a journey of first frustration, but it ended up in a journey of fascination.
 See, I didn't understand that God loves dreams.
 Because, as I mentioned before, I was raised in a culture to believe that God didn't speak
 anymore. Not through any other means, through good, clear biblical preaching. I love good,
 clear biblical preaching. To be sure, I think good, clear biblical teaching is in great
 needs in the body of Christ. I love it. I love sitting under and knowing to teaching. I love it.
 I love that we're spoiled with these like devices where we can just subscribe to our podcast and
 just listen to non-stop, incredible teaching. I love that and I value that. But we're in a grave
 danger if we value something above and beyond what God also values. See, I thought that God's
 speaking in dreams was so flaky, so subjective, so open to misinterpretation. And let's face facts
 way too weird. And yeah, because God is God, the way he got my attention was through two dreams,
 a couple of months apart. The first dream happened. Again, the context is that I'm beginning to wonder,
 does God speak apart from Scripture? And I began hearing stories of people and I was
 kind of intrigued but I wasn't sure and I didn't want to be deceived. And then I have
 a dream. My first dream takes place in Brussels. I love when you have a dream and you just
 know you're somewhere. Isn't that a great feeling? You don't even have a dream and you
 have a challenge for it. I had to dream myself as a person. I was like, "Well, how do you
 know you're a person?" I'm like, "I don't know. I just knew. Well, did you see the
 Eiffel Tower?" No. You see the chance of these? No, no, I just knew. I love that. I
 love that knowing. You know that knowing that you can have in dreams you can have in real
 life. It's a gift of the word of knowledge. You just know stuff and you don't know how
 you know it. Anyway, that was for free. So at this dream I'm in Brussels. I'm on a train.
 I'm in Brussels. In this train we pull into a train station. The train station is below
 ground level. I get off the train. I walk up a huge flight of steps up to ground level.
 And as I near the top, there's two young men handing out pieces of paper. One of them
 hands me the piece of paper and I look at it and it's in French. So in the dream, I'm
 I'm using my best schoolboy French to kind of translate what it means.
 And it says, "Mercury a set o'er."<br/>
 And I'm thinking, "Okay, that's Wednesday, I think, and I think at 7pm."
 And while I'm figuring this out, one of the young men comes up to me and says,
 "Sir, do you understand what you read?"
 And I said, "I don't."<br/>
 And he says, "Can I pray for you?"<br/>
 And I say, "Yes."<br/>
 And as he lays hands on me in the dream, everything goes white.
 I feel electricity pouring through my body.
 And I wake up shaking.<br/>
 And I'm like, "Whoa."<br/>
 I was intense.<br/>
 And I wrote it down.<br/>
 I wasn't in the habit of writing down my dreams.
 I just wrote it down.<br/>
 I don't know why, but I wrote it down.
 I wrote down my journal.<br/>
 What do you know?<br/>
 A couple of months later, I was actually in Brussels.
 I was visiting a friend.<br/>
 I don't think I'd ever been to Brussels before.
 And I'm on a train.<br/>
 I have a day off there at work.<br/>
 And so I'm on a train.<br/>
 And I go into Brussels.<br/>
 And I pull in this train station.<br/>
 It's an underground train station.<br/>
 It's a huge flight of steps up to the ground floor,
 up to the sidewalk.<br/>
 Some walk around this big flight of stairs and there's two young men at the top handing out pieces of paper.
 So take a piece of paper and it's in French.
 And so I'm standing there and I'm trying to work out what does it mean?
 And it says a mercury deacetor and I'm like, that's Wednesday.
 And one of the young men comes over to me and says, sir, do you understand what you read?
 And I say, I don't.<br/>
 And he says, well, we're from a church called Brownsville and we're here telling people about the love of Jesus.
 May we pray for you?<br/>
 And I say, yes, you can.<br/>
 and they pray for me and boom, down I go, right on the sidewalk and the middle of Brussels
 goes, "Ahh!"<br/>
 As the power of God is flowing through me.
 Sometime when I'm on the ground I'm like, "Boooo!"
 And I jump up and I have my backpack on me and I pull out my journal.
 And they are dated and handwritten as a dream that I read these kids from Brownsville and
 they freak out.<br/>
 I'm not sure who's more excited that I had to dream me or them.
 I don't remember going home thinking, "That's preposterous.
 You can't make this stuff up, it's unbelievable.
 God, maybe you do speak in dreams.<br/>
 Going out on a limb here.<br/>
 While a first dream showed me an event that was yet to come, the second was a little
 different.<br/>
 I had a dream and I had a dream.<br/>
 I used to work with computer systems and I used to work with a friend called Mark and
 I'd left that job and I'd moved on.<br/>
 But anyway, I have a dream.<br/>
 And in this dream I'm observing, I'm not in the dream.
 I'm just purely observing.<br/>
 And I see my friend Mark add a big computer terminal,
 and the whole computer system has crashed.
 And Mark is reading through lines of code.
 And he's reading through lines of code.
 He realizes this is code that Alan has written.
 And he knows that because I left comments in there.
 And in the dream, I'm aware that his heart is like, oh,
 it's this kind of like happy and sad.<br/>
 It's happy like, oh, I miss Alan.<br/>
 it's sad because I wish he wrote better code. And then I wake up. I'm thinking, that was
 a weird dream. Again, I'm not thinking, the Lord has been, I'm just thinking, that was
 a weird dream. And so a couple of days later, I bump into my friend, Mark, I'm like, oh,
 oh, dude, I had a dream about you on Friday night. And he's like, really, what was the
 dream? I said, in the dream, all the networks would crash and you were sitting there, you
 were trying to debug the code. And you came across some code I'd written and you were
 like, oh, I miss working with Alan, but I wish he'd written better code. And he's like,
 pale, he's like, "Dude, on Friday, that literally happened." I'm like, "What?" He said, "The whole
 network crash, shut down. It was my job to debug the code. I came across code and I was
 like, "God, maybe you're speaking to me in dreams. Now why would God do that?" Because
 he's Jehovah's Sneaky and he loves to get our attention. You know, as I said, the church
 I grew up in and I suspect many churches even today, dreams are often despised.
 Now we wouldn't say we despise them, but we would have no value on them.
 Perhaps we'd hear stories like that with some derision or some suspicion.
 Though they're despised by the church, they're not by the Lord.
 He actually loves them. In fact, his preferred way of speaking is in dreams.
 Look at this, Numbers 12 verse 6. "When there is a prophet among you,
 I the Lord reveal myself to them in visions and I speak to them in dreams."
 Consider that. If you and I are going to get excited, let's get excited about what God is
 excited by. He loves to speak in dreams. Now, last you think, "Well, it applied to me. I'm not a
 prophet, so I guess I'm excused from that verse, do you not?" Acts chapter 2, day Pentecost. Peter
 jumps up and he quotes the prophet Joel who speaks about a day that is coming and the
 day is here according to Peter. He said, "This is that." And he says this, "In the last
 days God says, 'I'll pour out my flesh on all people.'" And one of the, sorry, what did
 I say? No, I didn't. Okay. I will pour out my spirit. Thank you. I'll pour out my spirit
 on all flesh and your sons and daughters will prophesy one of the byproducts of the Holy
 spirit being released to everybody as we all get to prophesy. That was paradigm shifting
 in the Old Testament when the prophets got a prophesy or when the Holy Spirit descended
 on people for a moment. And so here Joel is looking forward to a day. Look at this, your
 sons and daughters will prophesy you young men with sea visions, your old men will dream
 dreams. Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my spirit in those days and
 will prophesy. So good news, if you're son or a daughter, you get included in the whole
 prophetic bubble. And the Lord, as a birthright of you being a child of God, would love to
 speak to you. I had a friend once and I said, "Why has God always speak to you in the shower?"
 And he says, "To be honest, it's the only time I've got my mouth shut." I said, "I'm
 I was filled with shampoo so the Lord was like, "I can get an edge or an edge raise?"
 One of my life verses came out of a journey with the Lord. I remember wrestling with this whole
 thing and had those dreams. I didn't want to be deceived. I'm asking the Lord literally. I remember
 praying and saying, "God, do you speak today?" Am I reading that day? Was Job 33 verse 14? Look
 Look at what it says.<br/>
 For God does speak, now one way, now another, then no one perceives it.
 Consider for a moment the kindness of God.
 Little brethren boy, little boy, grown up in an evangelical church is only grade for
 God speaking is through the Bible.<br/>
 And I'm asking God, do you speak today?
 And through the Bible, his answer comes, God does speak, now one way, now another, though
 man does not perceive it.<br/>
 verse just jumped into my heart and I was like, "Lord, I want to be somebody who perceives
 what you're saying."<br/>
 And I started my journey to understanding dreams and visions, which wasn't easy for
 me because I was like, "This is so flaky."
 Look at what it says.<br/>
 "For God does speak now one way, now and other, then no one perceives it in a dream,
 in a vision of the night when deep sleep falls on people as they slumber in their beds,
 may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings to turn them from wrongdoing and
 keep them from pride, to preserve them from the pit and their lives from perishing by
 the sword. I was so encouraged to read that God is speaking. I was so saddened that we're
 not listening. And right there I discovered in the Bible that God speaks in dreams. When
 When we sleep, God speaks in our ears, He speaks with warnings and instruction and all with
 the purpose of prospering us and saving us.
 Isn't He kind?<br/>
 Isn't He brilliant?<br/>
 I want to give you just four purposes of dreams.
 There's way more.<br/>
 I'm talking about like four high level purposes of dreams.
 As I was doing a study in Scripture of all the dreams, there's about 21 different dreams
 in Scripture.<br/>
 They're fascinating to read.<br/>
 I'd encourage you to read them.<br/>
 And these are the four main purposes I've found.
 There's way more.<br/>
 John Paul Jackson, who's an expert,<br/>
 had 20 different types of dreams,<br/>
 but I want to have lunch today,<br/>
 so I'm just telling you four.<br/>
 The first classification is warning dreams.
 We've already read some of those.<br/>
 You know, Joseph gets his dreams from the angels,
 but there's several in scripture.<br/>
 Do, do, do, do.<br/>
 What about the wise men?<br/>
 The wise men go to see Herod,<br/>
 they're like, "Hey, where's the king?<br/>
 "We've come to pay homage."<br/>
 And then Herod's like, "Oh yeah,<br/>
 when you find them, come back, tell me about it. And it says this, verse 12 of Matthew 2,
 "And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country
 by another route." God is so good at keeping us from danger by warning us in dreams. How
 about this one? Insight and understanding. I love that. I love being so perplexed and
 saying, God, I don't understand what's going on. Going to bed, doing nothing and waking
 up with a dream with an answer to my question. If that's not fast-tracked to revelation,
 I don't know what is. I mean, you can't be lazier than when you're asleep. You're like,
 "Now, I'm not suggesting you're like, I don't understand, you know, high school students aren't
 in here, but you know, like, I don't stand this method. Give me some Nykel. See what the
 Lord has to say. I'm not suggesting that, but what I am saying is revelation, insight, and
 understanding comes as we sleep." I love the story. You know, it's very familiar with Jacob's ladder,
 where he is wandering around, he goes to sleep, has this incredible dream of a ladder going
 into heaven and angels ascending and descending on it, and he wakes up and he says this,
 surely the Lord is in this place and I was not aware of it. How many of us need that revelation?
 Where we are in life at moment, this moment, and we're like, "Where's the Lord?" You have a dream,
 you're like, "I was not aware of it, you're right here." He was afraid and said, "How awesome is
 is this place, this is none other than the house of God, this is the gate of heaven.
 I love this, I'll be honest with you, this is a weird dream, but stay with me.
 How about this one?<br/>
 This is, I'm not even in the story of Jacob and his uncle, Laban, right?
 Oh my gosh, this dream is just crazy.<br/>
 Listen to this, imagine having lunch with Laban, you're at Chipotle, you're sitting
 down, you've got some tacos, and he's like, "Hey, had a dream?"
 I'm like, "Oh, what was the dream?"<br/>
 In breeding season, I had this dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats were
 mating with the flock where streets speckled or spotted, and you're like, "Okay, good
 conversation.<br/>
 Thanks so much for sharing."<br/>
 The angel of God said to me in the dream, "Jacob," and I answered, "Here I am," and
 he said, "Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are streets speckled
 or spotted for I've seen all that Laban has been doing to you."
 And over tacos, you're trying to work out what does the dream mean and what's the symbolism?
 Well, you've got to keep reading to find out what happens.
 He ended up using that revelation that he had in a dream to breed really strong goats
 that were street speckled or spotted.<br/>
 Traditionally, nobody wanted those goats.
 He took them and it says this, Genesis 30, verse 43, "In this way, in the way of him
 acting out what he saw in his dream, the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own
 large flocks, female and male servants and camels and donkeys. What if the answer to
 the prayer that you're praying right now will be answered in a dream? What if you have
 no grid for the dream to come to you? What if God's been speaking to you in a dream and
 you've not been perceiving it? What if the solution to your financial woes or your relational
 woes are waiting for you when you go to bed tonight? I love, I love going to bed and just
 Lord would you speak to me tonight in a dream? I love it. It is my preferred way of hearing
 the voice of the Lord. You know why? I can offer zero interference. The Lord speaks to me in a vision
 or I have a word of knowledge. Man, I have to go out and I don't know. Did I just make it up?
 Is it just me feeling? Is it my compassion for something that what's going on? Well, I have a dream.
 I've got nothing to do with it. I just have this dream and I'm left with this amazing what feels
 like jigsaw puzzle. I'm like, I'm so excited. You know, a lot of the dreams that I have come along
 wrong, under this thing of insight and understanding. I remember last month at a situation in my
 work where I couldn't understand the motives of somebody's heart. Now, they're not in
 this room, so nobody used to be suspicious. But I'm having this interaction with somebody.
 The interaction seemed fine, but oh, it just didn't sit well with me. I'm like, Lord,
 sometimes I can't tell. Is this my discernment or is it my judgment? I don't know if you've
 never been there. Okay, only one honest person. All right, the rest of your father, give him
 a dream to convict them. Right? So I'm like, Lord, I don't know because it just, ah, that
 conversation really bothered me. I don't know what it is, but you speak to me. That night,
 I go to bed, I have a dream in the dream. I go to Jeff Dollar. And I say, Hey, Jeff,
 here's the situation, had this conversation, and I'm feeling like this. What do you think?
 And in the dream, Jeff dollar says to me, Alan, that's not a judgment, that's wisdom.
 As I'm leaving the dream, the Holy Spirit gives me a tool of interpretation in the dream
 and I wake up and I use that tool to...
 And I'm like, "Oh Lord, and I just felt instant peace."
 I was like, "You have given me insight and understanding about this situation."
 Sometimes it's a pastor.<br/>
 People come on my radar because of a dream.
 And I'm just like, "Oh God, thank you for that."
 Age and I have bought two houses since moving to America.
 The first time we bought a house, it wasn't even on my radar.
 This is the fun of being married to a prophet, Aja,
 was like, I think we need to buy a house.
 I was like, I think we need more money to buy a house.
 I don't think that's going to happen.<br/>
 And so she's learned not to push.<br/>
 She was just like, OK, Lord, I feel like we need to buy a house.
 Would you speak to Alan?<br/>
 A couple of months past, I have a dream.
 In the dream, a friend of mine walks up to me and says,
 hey, there's a new woman that started working at my job.
 I think she can help you buy a house.<br/>
 Well, I wake up from that dream.<br/>
 I tell Aja, and Aja's like, oh, that's interesting.
 I forget about it till I come to church and my friend walks up to me and says, "Hey,
 we need to tell you, there's a new lady that's joined our staff.
 She's at my job.<br/>
 I think she can help you buy a house."
 And I was like, "Is that so?"<br/>
 And so one thing leads to another, we bought a house.
 But I love it.<br/>
 It started in a dream, moving to Nashville.
 I have a dream in Iceland.<br/>
 It's a dream within a dream.<br/>
 I won't tell you the whole dream, but in the dream, this amazing event happens.
 We're all celebrating and we go to bed.
 We retire that night.<br/>
 As we go to bed, I have a dream, but I'm still in the first dream, you with me?
 And in the dream, I dream exactly what just took place, and then I wake up.
 And when I wake up, I'm thinking, "That's amazing.
 I just dreamt what happened."<br/>
 And I go and I find John Arnett, my pastor at the time.
 I was just, "John, this is still in the dream.
 I just dreamt this.<br/>
 What do you think it means?"<br/>
 And in the dream, John says to me, "You need to connect with Jeff Dollar, and you need
 to connect with him now."<br/>
 And I wake up and I'm like, holy mother of pearl, that's the most intense dream I've
 ever had and I get up, it's about 4am, I'm in Iceland, I write down to this day the most
 intense dream I've ever had.<br/>
 Dreaming in the dream ends by John Arnett saying, you need to connect with Jeff, you need
 to connect with him now.<br/>
 I don't know Jeff Dollar, I've met Jeff Dollar.
 I'm like, this is crazy, so I called John Arnett.
 I said, John, I had an intense dream last night.
 He's like, tell me the dream.<br/>
 So I tell him the dream, it's a dream in the dream and it's...
 And I said, so what do you think the dream means?
 John's like, "I'm not an expert, but I think it means you need to connect with Jeff Dollar,
 and you need to connect with him now."
 So here's his phone number.<br/>
 "Jeff's great, you love him."<br/>
 And I was like, "Okay."<br/>
 So I just call up Jeff Dollar and said, "Hey, you don't know me.
 I didn't say, "Hey, I had a dream."<br/>
 And I just said, "Hey, you don't know me.
 My wife and I are going to be in Nashville in a couple of weeks.
 We'd love to meet you."<br/>
 And we met him, and the next thing we know, we moved to Nashville.
 Star in the Dream.<br/>
 How about this?<br/>
 For telling future events.<br/>
 I got lazy with my biblical references here.
 I just said all of Joseph's and Daniel's dreams.
 (audience laughs)<br/>
 Scholars today are still deciphering<br/>
 the interpretation of Daniel's dreams.
 So that's seriously, like from the dreams they had
 as young men all the way through to interpreting
 potifers and their king's dreams, it's phenomenal.
 I just, I love that.<br/>
 Incredible.<br/>
 And then this last one that I've got here
 is visitations from God.<br/>
 This is easily my favorite classification of dream.
 And if you're listening, if you're kind of tuned out right now,
 come back, come back, come back,<br/>
 'cause this is like the most powerful moment of the sermon.
 There's so many events in scripture<br/>
 that take place in a dream.<br/>
 Right, that is phenomenal.<br/>
 The one I wanna focus is found in First Kings,
 chapter three, verse five.<br/>
 We all know about King Solomon,<br/>
 the wisest man that ever lived.<br/>
 And we also know about his encounter with the Lord,
 as the Lord came to him and said,<br/>
 hey, ask me anything you want, I'll give it to you.
 And he's like, ah, I'm just a young boy,
 give me wisdom so that I can rule your people well.
 And the Lord's like, because you answered that,
 I'm not only gonna give you wisdom,<br/>
 but I'm gonna give you everything you didn't ask
 for riches, fame, wealth, all of that.
 Now, I wasn't aware, but that whole exchange
 took place in a dream.<br/>
 I was kind of hoping for a bit of shock and awe, so we'll try that again.
 And I didn't realize that all of that took place in a dream.
 [audience groans]<br/>
 [audience laughs]<br/>
 I feel so loved right now.<br/>
 It's the most engaged audience I've ever taught. I love it.
 But consider this for a moment. He had a dream.
 He was not involved in that at all.<br/>
 a dream and in the dream what took place in the dream had profound impact outside of the dream.
 Can you see why I'm asking the Lord for dreams?
 My Lord, I want to encounter you in my dreams.
 It's amazing that out of the dream of that young man, his whole life and the destiny of the whole
 nation he was leading changed. He had a physical manifestation of wisdom and
 wealth. How many of you are excited for your Sunday afternoon nap now? How many of you are aware
 of a man called John Paul Jackson? He's no longer with us sadly he's in having a great profit, a
 phenomenal dream expert, gave his life to study in biblical dream interpretation with the privilege
 of having him several times in Toronto. And I remember one time he was here for a conference
 we're going to have dinner with him and you know AJ, AJ cheats. I mean she has some of
 the most incredible dreams that are just all literal. She just needs no interpretation.
 She's like, I'm just God's favorite. What can you do? I'm like, I thought I was God's
 favorite but I still have to interpret the riddles. But anyway, she asked John Paul,
 John Paul, she said, I have these dreams. I've never heard anybody talk about them. Can you
 tell me like, what are these dreams? I mean, he's like, well tell me your dream. She says,
 "Well, what happens is I go bad, I fall asleep,
 "but then I wake up, but I'm still asleep."
 Like, okay, should I wake up and I'm in a black room?
 I'm just in dark, but I'm fully awake, fully conscious,
 though I'm still asleep,<br/>
 and then the Lord just comes and speaks to me audibly.
 And John Paul says, "Yeah, those are not dreams."
 She's like, "They're not?<br/>
 "They're visitations of the night."<br/>
 And then he's like, "You know, pass the bread rolls."
 And just as if that was the most normal thing in the world,
 I was like, "Oh, okay, I guess you're having
 of the night. Again, what are we missing out on when we ignore the things that the Lord
 is doing while we're asleep? I want to leave you with four things. I'm hoping to wet your
 appetite for more dream interaction. I want to leave you with four things that you do
 once you've had a dream. The first thing is it's important to understand the interpretation
 of your dreams belongs to God. The same Holy Spirit that gave you the revelation is the
 same Holy Spirit would only be too happy to help you gain understanding from your dreams.
 Look at these two experts. This is a quote from Daniel and quote from Genesis where Joseph
 is speaking. Daniel, I mean Daniel, Daniel serves on psychopaths. You read the book of
 Daniel recently, who reads that? It's just unbelievable. So King Nebuchadnezzar has this dream. The dream freaks
 him out, calls all his wise men and say, "He can interpret my dream for me." And I'm like, "Sure, tell us the dream."
 He's like, "Uh-uh, you tell me the dream and the interpretation." I'm like, "Sir, nobody can do that. Fine, you're all dead."
 And just issues, this big command is going to kill a lot of them. That news reaches Daniel. He goes and sees his three friends.
 He says, "We need to pray."<br/>
 They pray and the Lord gives Daniel not only the dream but the interpretation.
 Phenomenal.<br/>
 Before I talk anymore, how wonderful would it be if the Lord started troubling our world
 leaders with godly dreams?<br/>
 That bypasses the intellect, bypasses advisors and law and this and that and that and that
 and that.<br/>
 And the only answer they can get is from Godly counsel.
 Lord, would you trouble our world leaders
 with Godly revelation where they need to seek out
 Godly men and women to give Godly revelation
 to help change and transform nations?<br/>
 So anyway, comes in before the king.<br/>
 And the king says to Daniel,<br/>
 are you able to tell me what I saw<br/>
 in my dream and interpret it?<br/>
 Now, consider, we already know yes he can.
 Consider also that if he can't,<br/>
 Look at Daniel's response.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 No wise man in Chantor, Magician or Diviner can explain to the King the Mysteries asked
 about.<br/>
 But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries.
 Isn't that a revelation that needs to come back to the world?
 He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come.
 Your dream and the visions that pass through your mind as you are lying in bed are these.
 them the dream tells them what it means profound impact on that king's life. Remember Joseph
 is in prison and the cup bear and the baker both have dreams. They both look really, really
 sad. They're having their latte in the morning and and and Joseph's like, "Hey, what's wrong?"
 And they're like, "Well, we both had dreams, but there's no one to interpret them." And
 then Joseph said to them, Genesis 40 verse 8, "Do not interpretations belong to God.
 me your dreams. I love, I have many friends who are very, very gifted dream interpreters.
 I mean, I can differentiate between people who are skilled from history and from practice
 interpreting dreams to people who have a gift of wisdom and understanding. There's a couple
 of people I know that when they interpret dreams, I'm like, "That is profound. It's amazing."
 And I love that. And I love that we need one another. Daniel could interpret the dreams
 of others be at difficulty at time interpreting his own. It's because we need the body of
 Christ. But here's the thing at the end of the day, interpretation belongs to God. In
 the years I've been studying dreams, there's two things that make me nervous. The first
 thing is that Christians who think that every dream they have must be from God. That's not
 true. The second thing that makes me nervous is folks who think they can just look up a
 dictionary of meaning and deduce the meaning of the dreams. Now, to be sure, there are
 consistent symbols used throughout scripture. But here's the thing. There's
 also that whole thing. I mean, for example, snake, good or bad? Bad, alright? Snake in
 scripture is used to represent Satan, right? That great serpent. Except for that one time
 when all the people were being bitten by snakes and Moses fashioned a snake on a rod
 and held it up and everybody who looked at it was saved and it was a type of who.
 So there you have it.<br/>
 Say it could either be Satan or Jesus.
 The Holy Spirit just loves to keep you on your toes.
 What about, you know, Azlian?<br/>
 You see, Azlian and a dream good or bad?
 Good because the lion of the tribe of Judah, yeah.
 Except for our great adversary who, you know, roams around seeking to whom he can devour,
 like a lion.<br/>
 So here's the thing, leaning on dictionaries will only get you so far.
 You need the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit to rest upon us and give us wisdom.
 This is the majesty of God.<br/>
 He speaks to us in riddles, so we need him to interpret it.
 He's a genius like that.<br/>
 I'll tell you why in a second.<br/>
 Second thing that's going to help you is you're walking with a Lord, learning to hear
 from His.<br/>
 You cannot interpret that what you do not have.
 That means get in the practice of writing down your dreams or recording your dreams.
 I tried recording my dreams, but they basically sounded like, "The dream is going to be generous
 and run for you in the morning.<br/>
 I'm like, "What is that?<br/>
 "It doesn't help me."<br/>
 Meanwhile, I'm covered in bruises,<br/>
 'cause they just like, "Shum, shum, dress sleep."
 So I have a little iPhone app,<br/>
 and that comes as a huge shock to y'all,
 but I have a little app on my phone when I wake up,
 as soon as I have that dream,<br/>
 I have stopped doing, at least I hope I stopped doing that,
 that dream was so vivid, I'll remember it in the morning,
 and whenever I've done that,<br/>
 it was the clearest dream I've ever had.
 I'll clearly remember it.<br/>
 And by lunchtime, you're like,<br/>
 "I think I had a dream."<br/>
 So I've just disciplined myself.<br/>
 I'm going to write down the dream.<br/>
 I've got an app.<br/>
 For those of you who care, some people ask.
 It's called Bear, like the animal.<br/>
 And the reason I have that app is it allows the screen
 to be inverted.<br/>
 Because the last thing you want at 2 a.m. in the morning
 is your retinus to be burnt by a bright white screen
 and black text.<br/>
 So it's a black screen with white text,
 and I can write down my dream.<br/>
 So write down your dream.<br/>
 It's super, super important.<br/>
 When you do that, you become like Daniel.
 Look at this, Daniel, seven, verse one.
 In the first year of Belsh's Ark, King of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions passed through his mind as he was lying in bed.
 He wrote down the substance of his dreams.
 We're kind of glad he did because half his book is made up of his dreams, so he didn't be sure a book.
 There's also a link between writing things down and revelation.
 First Chronicles 28, 19, David said this, "All this, the Lord made me understand in writing,
 by his hand upon me all the details of this pattern.
 The Lord gave him revelation.<br/>
 He gained understanding as he wrote it down.
 When we get in a habit of writing down our dreams,
 the Lord sees that we honor what's precious to him
 and he gives us more.<br/>
 Number three, in my experience,<br/>
 most dreams that you have, 95% to 99%<br/>
 the dreams that you have will be about you.
 And a lot of them are going to be symbolic.
 In Scripture, more than half the dreams are symbolic.
 In my experience speaking to me personally, about 75% of my dreams are symbolic.
 I wake up and I know there's lots of imagery in it.
 I don't know what it means, but this is where the fun begins.
 In Proverbs, I think it's 25, too.<br/>
 It says, "The glory of God to conceal a matter is the glory of kings to search a matter out."
 Well that means as God loves to take his communication and wrap it up in riddles and play on words and dreams and visions and parables and then throw it to you.
 And then we get to unwrap it and it times it's incredibly frustrating but the goal is to bring us back to him so he gets to see our face.
 So he speaks to us, we're like our spirits are alive but we don't know the meaning.
 We wander around and eventually we come back saying, "God, would you tell me the dream?"
 He's like, "I'd love to tell you the dream.
 I just want to see your face."<br/>
 It's win-win.<br/>
 We get more of him.<br/>
 He gets more of us.<br/>
 And he gives us the meaning and the understanding.
 "Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh."
 You know the instead of Jesus?<br/>
 He said nothing to the people without teaching them in parables.
 Same principle.<br/>
 Because the hungry press on, the satisfied walk away full.
 I'm thinking about how much sweet intimacy I missed with the Lord, because I despised
 one of the ways he loves to speak.<br/>
 I used to scoff at people who said, "I hurt this in a dream."
 But I've come to appreciate the majesty of the way God wrapped things up in riddles
 and plays on words and all this sort of stuff.
 I think it's beautiful and I love it.<br/>
 Finally, scripture is the bedrock of interpretive principles.
 My encouragement is if you want to understand your dreams, read scripture, but also read
 the dreams and their interpretations.<br/>
 Read the parables.<br/>
 Read the visions.<br/>
 If you're up to it, read Ezekiel in one sitting.
 some red bull ready to go because it starts off intense and doesn't slow down. When you
 read that, you get interpretive clues just given to you all along. I love it. I'm not
 talking about my dream within a dream. Josh does. Remember I was talking about the dream
 within a dream? I always stuck with me. I had the same dream inside of a dream. I must
 means something. So one day I'm reading and I'm reading about Pharaoh having his dreams.
 Remember the dreams about the fat cows, the skinny cows, the fat head of wheat, the skinny
 head of wheat. And he's perplexed. Again, another world leader, totally perplexed, calls
 in Joseph. Joseph tells on the dream, listen to this little nugget that's found in Genesis
 41 verse 32. Joseph says this, "The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms
 is that the matter has been firmly decided by God and God will do it soon.
 When you have a dream within a dream or two dreams about it or a recurring dream, God
 is highlighting this.<br/>
 He's got a big highlighter, big bold caps, underlines saying, "Pay attention to this.
 This is matter has been decided in my heart and I will do it soon."
 All sorts of things like that.<br/>
 I was reading one of Daniel's dreams.<br/>
 I studied this a couple of weeks ago and in the dream, remember the dream with the ten
 horns and the other horn is a little horn is super boastful.
 man, I was like, he seems really interested in that little horn.
 Pay attention to the details that stand out to you in the dream.
 All right, not that one's a stand out to you after, but in the dream, if something stands
 out, play a game of contrast.<br/>
 If in the dream there's a big tiger, ask yourself, why a tiger are not a leopard?
 Like why a tiger, not an elephant?<br/>
 When you begin to ask questions of the Lord, you just begin to see His majesty and His
 brilliance and what He's doing, maybe He's playing words.
 But anyway, the little horn, in the dream, he's asking about the little horn, and an angel
 explains to him who the little horn is.
 I was like, "Well, that's cheating."<br/>
 He's not even out of his dream yet to interpret it.
 How's that fair?<br/>
 You know what I did?<br/>
 I was inspired by that.<br/>
 I said, "Lord, if you would give Daniel interpretive clues while he's in the dream, would you
 do that for me too?"<br/>
 And guess what?<br/>
 Did that for me too?<br/>
 Which leads me to my final point.<br/>
 I want to encourage you that everything you don't have in the Kingdom is on the other
 side of one activity, asking.<br/>
 I remember listening to Bob Jones, a famous prophet, a wonderful prophet, now with the
 Lord, he used to get anywhere between five to ten dreams and visions and night, visitations.
 I'd be like, "That is unfair.<br/>
 Lord, He is hoarding all the revelations.
 Share some of that.<br/>
 "Here I am in Scotland."<br/>
 I get none.<br/>
 And the Lord says, "You do not have because you do not ask."
 So I started asking, "God, would you speak to me in dreams?"
 If you're listening to me this morning, "Well, I don't get dreams."
 Maybe you're being passive.<br/>
 I don't get dreams because God likes me more than you.
 I get dreams because I ask God more than you.
 Probably.<br/>
 I ask God all the time, "God, speak to me in a dream.
 I love a dream."<br/>
 "Ah, I love it."<br/>
 I got a dream I hold onto, I treasure, I roll around my head all the time.
 I had a dream last week, profound dream.
 I had a dream that I was supposed to be at an appointment at 4pm and I get there at 3.58pm.
 And as I'm waiting for my appointment at 3.58, boom, the radio pops on, I haven't even done anything.
 And they're like, "Warning, this is tsunami and a tornado about to happen."
 I'm like, "Oh my gosh, as soon as that finished, boom, tsunami hits."
 Next thing, boom, tornado hits. I'm like, "What the heck's happening?"
 Next thing I know, I'm flying in my car thing and this is terrifying. What's going to happen?
 Next thing I know, I'm a Chester and Betsy Killsford's house. I wake up and I'm just like,
 "Good Lord, what was that?" So I asked the Lord, "Lord, I don't know what that means.
 I need someone to stand." So the Lord says, "I'll happily tell you." So he tells me what the dream
 means. He's like, "The dream means, Alan. You've just been through a season of transition. You've
 just lost your mother. You've just lost your father. That's the tsunami. That's the, what's the other
 one. "Turn it on." He said, "When you're caught up, you don't know which way is left or right.
 That's how you're feeling right now. The fact that you're at the kill for us, I love that you've
 got to look for healing of your heart." I look up 358. I hope this is like meaningful to you when
 I actually finally read it. You're like, "Oh, yeah, here you go. Lamentations 358. Lord, you have come
 to my defense. You've redeemed my life." Look at the kindness of the Lord. So I have this dream and
 and it's hugely impact him, but I was stuck without the interpretation.
 What did I do? I just asked the Lord, "Lord, what does this dream mean?"
 And he told me.<br/>
 And so my encouragement to you, if you're a singer,
 "I never get dreams," or "I never remember my dreams,"
 ask the Lord. He'd love to speak to you.
 I feel like at the moment in this season of my life,
 I get a significant dream from the Lord, maybe once every 10 days.
 Like every week or so, I'm like, "Oh, this is profound, Lord.
 But I love this stuff.<br/>
 My point is, like everything, we do not have because we do not ask.
 Well, there you go.<br/>
 I encourage you.<br/>
 Read your Bible.<br/>
 Pray every day, you'll grow, grow, grow.
 And at night, ask God for a dream and be astonished at what comes your way.
 Here's the thing.<br/>
 What I would love to do is I would love to ask those of you who would like to grow in
 the frequency of dreams that you have or would like understand the dreams you have to stand.
 I would love to pray for you.<br/>
 There is nothing special about my prayer.
 What special is you responding in faith to the preaching of God's Word?
 Like if I sowed salvation and you stood for salvation, that would be a great harvest.
 But today I have preached on dreams in God's desire to speak to you in dreams.
 And so I'm glad that you stood.<br/>
 So Holy Spirit, we're standing because we love your revelation, we love your wisdom,
 we love your understanding.<br/>
 And Lord, I'm asking that all of us here, Lord, would have a marked increase in our dream life,
 that we would have visitations from the Lord in our dreams, Lord, that you would speak
 to us, that you would warn us, that you'd give us prophetic understanding, you'd give
 us insight.<br/>
 And at Lord for those of us who say that we can't dream, Lord, I ask that you would remove
 any blockage in our hearts and that you would love to speak to us Lord.
 For those of us that do dream Lord, I ask that you would increase the number of dreams
 that we have from you, that you would give us a spirit of discipline to write things down
 and wise counsel as we seek to understand what you're saying to us at night.
 And we ask that in the precious name of Jesus.
 Amen.<br/>
 I want to do one other thing.<br/>
 If you're not going to ask you about your hands, I don't want to embarrass you.
 But if you've been a person that struggled with night terrors or nightmares and the
 thought of you having dreams again scares you, I'd love to pray for you because it sounds
 like the hallmark of the enemy to rob you of getting something that God would love to
 give you.<br/>
 So let me pray for you.<br/>
 If that's you, just, I don't know, just tell yourself he's talking about me just so that
 you're participating in the activity.<br/>
 So Lord, for those of us who've had night terrors or nightmares or are scared about
 having dreams, Lord, in case this content disturbs us, Lord, I take authority over every demonic
 thing right now and bind it and forbid it from manifesting while we sleep.
 And Lord, I ask that right now that you would assign Lord angels and the sword of the Lord
 Lord to sever every ungodly access that is accessing people while they sleep.
 And that you would make us a community of dreamers that we would have incredible revelation
 that would be used to change our businesses, our communities, our families, the city,
 the state and our nation, Lord.<br/>
 And I'm asking that you would put the right people in the right places to interpret the
 dreams of others, Lord, and that we would see your kingdom come in Jesus' name.
 Amen.<br/>
 Have a seat.<br/>
 You guys are wonderful.<br/>
 Bye family, to yous, we wish you a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
 Bye bye!<br/>
