<p> Island and AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 -Hey, did Jones? -Yes, sir.<br/>
 -Pissel 262. How the heck are you?<br/>
 -I'm well. Thank you. How are you?<br/>
 -I'm a little bit chilly.<br/>
 This tabletop is stone and it is... -So cold.
 -...a reason cold, but it feels quite nice to rest my arms again.
 -It doesn't feel nice. It's so cold.<br/>
 -We are recording this on a Sunday afternoon.
 We had lunch at three o'clock because that's when we got home from.
 Yes, church went a little long, which was wonderful.
 It was really dark outside.<br/>
 You made taco soup.<br/>
 Whenever it's raining, I want soup.<br/>
 And I don't begrudge you that.<br/>
 And there's maybe three or four different soups that I make.
 And I would say this one was the best taco soup you've ever made.
 Yeah, but you say that every time I make taco soup,
 they just keep getting better.<br/>
 OK.<br/>
 I'm not given to here hyperbole or lying.
 OK.<br/>
 They were amazing.<br/>
 Amazing, they were amazing.<br/>
 Weekly catch up, tell me about this week.
 I feel like this week is worthy of a weekly catch up.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah, lots happened this week.
 I think this was the first full week
 that I didn't teach at the school.
 So that was nice.
 I mean, in terms of, you know, just workloads.
  </li><li>What were you doing while I was teaching?
 'Cause I taught on five-fold ministry,
 Apostles and Brothers.
  </li><li>Well, I did take Monday off.
  </li><li>Oh, look at you.
  </li><li>So I just sat at home in the quiet.
 You were gone, the kids were gone,
 This house is so nice and quiet when you all aren't here.
 I just sat in a living room and just breathed.
  </li><li>I taught at the school and then I taught at Aminee
 and I can't remember the last time I was done.
 That's probably years ago where I've done a full day of teaching.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then go teach at Aminee.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I had fun teaching at Aminee.
 I think I'd forget, I'm not very good at titling.
 I rarely ever, if ever, title my messages.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Because the title of my message last Monday was,
 God's purposes can't be stopped, but they can be missed.
  </li><li>Oh, that's interesting.
  </li><li>Yeah, and I almost became a Calvinist.
  </li><li>Oh, oh dear.
  </li><li>No, I was just talking about how--
  </li><li>Let's notify RT.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>I already did that, you know,
 that I'm just like, hey, I preached a message
 that might make you less ashamed to say you're,
 you know, I'm a friend of yours.
  </li><li>Oh good.
  </li><li>But yeah, no, I had lots of fun.
 I've just been sat with the majesty
 and the confidence of God that he's God
 and that he's all powerful
 and that we can still opt out of what he's doing,
 which by the way, we never wanna opt out.
 But often we do.
 Because of her or a variety of reasons.
 That's why I speak done.
 Speak done.
 That's what I speak done.
  </li><li>That's what he speak done.
  </li><li>I wasn't a spokesperson in England.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>A building of show notes.
  </li><li>Don't speak with a Scottish accent
 or this is gonna have to be a short podcast.
  </li><li>That might have been a short.
  </li><li>Did you, I never in my wildest dreams
 would I ever think that a Scottish accent
 would be a turn off.
 Apologies to the whole nation as well.
  </li><li>Turn off or turn on.
  </li><li>Turn on is what I meant.
  </li><li>Well, yeah, I married a guy with a Scottish accent
 And now you sound like an American.
  </li><li>I sound like American.
  </li><li>No, not quite.
  </li><li>I sound like a real good American.
  </li><li>Not like a redneck, but just an American.
  </li><li>Okay, we're just a big hole.
 People groups here.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>All right, I taught you talk.
  </li><li>Hey friends, if you're a redneck, we still love you.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>We do.
 We've got lots of good friends for a good redneck.
  </li><li>Well, yeah.
 I was gonna say, wouldn't they call themselves like more?
 I'm trying to think.
  </li><li>No, they call themselves redneck.
  </li><li>No, they call themselves, okay.
  </li><li>Yep, good.
  </li><li>Moving right along.
  </li><li>Moving right along.
 Before we lose subscribers.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>We had, because it's kind of a relaxing week,
 like moving into relaxing week.
 We've done lots of movies at home,
 which we haven't had time to sit and watch movies.
  </li><li>Yeah, I haven't watched a movie in months.
  </li><li>We watched the new James Bond movie, what'd you think?
  </li><li>We did.
 It was very long.
  </li><li>Oh, it was, two hours, 37 minutes,
 something like that.
  </li><li>It felt even longer.
 I am a sucker for a good James Bond movie
 and this was a good James Bond movie.
  </li><li>It was a good movie.
  </li><li>No spoilers. - It was a good movie.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>I just, I love the scope.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>The grandiose cinematic scope
 and the cinematography was beautiful and,
 oh, I loved it.
 I think it's gonna tie into what we're gonna talk about.
 But I've got so many emotional memories
 tied to James Bond movies.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Because as a family, it was the one movie
 that my parents would let us watch when we were kids.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>That's how I learned about making out.
 James Bond. That's how you learned about. I don't know. I remember my mom and dad would explain it to James Bond kiss. Yeah. I mean, forget that he was a flander. Those morals escaped. Do you think James Bond ever belched in his wife's mouth when he was kissing her?
 Okay, that's coming up. Well, we're doing a weekly catch up. So it just came to me. I had a moment in her marriage where I've never been so simultaneously.
 horrified and astonished that I'm still alive to tell them.
 I leaned into kiss AJ, open-mouth kiss, and as I leaned into kisser, I
 belched. I don't mean a burp.
 No. I don't mean a burp. I mean a belch.
 It was an exhale as well, and I kind of blew it onto her mouth.
 You didn't beat me. I was surprised.
 I walked away.
 It shocked.
 And then you tried to apologize profusely.
 I still think you owe me something.
 I just haven't decided what I'm going to require of you.
 Well, I did not mean it.
 Yeah, it's OK.
 You're still going to pay.
 It was horrifying.
 Anyway, love the James Bond movie.
 Yeah.
 And then last night we watched Shang-Chi and the Legend
 of the Ten Rings.
 Yes.
 What do you think that is?
 I guess it's a Marvel movie, isn't it?
 There's some guests.
 It's a Marvel movie.
 Well, I was thinking, you know, in my mind, some things get--
 Buckle up.
 --a little confused.
 So I realized when we were starting the James Bond movie,
 we had to go back and watch trailers
 for the previous four movies,
 because I was thinking, well, no, I'm sort of a malgomating
 mission impossible with James Bond.
 And so I was like, oh yeah, I know who that guy is,
 'cause he gets trapped at the end of the last movie
 in a box and an underground and whatever.
 And then I was like, oh no, that,
 this thing doesn't have time for us in it.
 So we had to go back and watch trailers and you like,
  </li><li>Yeah, I showed you like the previous film
 for Daniel Craig and the trailer
 so you can know who they're talking about.
  </li><li>Yeah, and so I realized sometimes I get them all
 and jumbled up and then sometimes with the,
 not so much with the Marvel movies
 but because they're all sort of different,
 well like, you know, there's like guardian of the galaxy,
 Marvel people and then there's like--
  </li><li>To be fair, there are a lot of super-guitar
  </li><li>More above you, people, yeah.
  </li><li>And the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
 And it used to be like we were in a big routine
 of when they would come out.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And you know, the last couple of years has been chaos.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so yeah, we, there's a movie out in the theaters
 right now called The Eternals, which we haven't seen
 'cause we're not prone to go to a movie theater
 in the midst of a pandemic.
 So we're just watching them when they come out.
 I got confused that you,
 I got confused that you had already seen the Black Widow one.
 We watched it darling in our living room.
  </li><li>Yeah, see, I don't.
  </li><li>So Abby remembers that the three of us watched it,
 but for some reason you have a mental block.
  </li><li>I don't think you're lying to me,
 but I don't remember what you think.
  </li><li>Yeah, I don't remember what you think.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I think we've established that
 over the course of our marriage.
  </li><li>Certainly.
  </li><li>All right, anything else happened this week?
  </li><li>Adoption news.
  </li><li>Adoption news, yeah, we launched the adoption podcast,
 of course, and got lots of great comments
 and just super encouraging words.
 So thank you.
  </li><li>You know one of my favorite things is,
 I don't, when I say lots of people come out of the woodwork,
 I don't mean they were previously hiding.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But one of the beautiful things about talking about
 adopting is I've had people come to me and say,
 did you know I was adopted, which I hear the two did not know?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I've had birth moms come and say,
 hey, I placed my child for adoption 30 years ago.
 I love that you're adopting.
 I've had people who said, oh, we adopted.
 And I didn't know and getting to hear people's stories
 has been wonderful.
 So thank you to everybody who's reached out
 and share the story or encouragement or offer to help,
 we greatly appreciate all of this.
  </li><li>Yes, so great.
  </li><li>And also thank you to everybody who's given.
 We have a GoFundMe, and we're just really blown away
 by people's generosity and their thoughtfulness.
 One of the sad things I didn't realize
 is we don't get contact details for people who give.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So we would love to send you a card or call you
 and say thank you.
  </li><li>Yeah, I was all like, all right, I'm gonna send
 thank you cards and we're like, we don't have
 anybody's information to do that.
  </li><li>All we can do is use GoFundMe kind of built in.
 So if you just, you know, and I'm worried that might get sent to spam, but a big thank you to everybody who's there.
 Yes.
 Thank you so much.
 And a reminder, if you want to stay up to date on our adoption journey, go to ellenanag.com/adopt.
 And if somehow you missed that episode and you didn't know we're adopting, guess what?
 We're adopting.
 Yeah.
 So we signed up with another larger agency this week.
 So yeah.
 We're still in the waiting game.
 We're in the waiting game.
 And I'm excited.
 Yeah.
 OK.
 Anything else from this week?
 I think that's it.
  </li><li>Mark de Ponce. - Mark de Ponce here.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Mark de Ponce here.
 Mark de Ponce is here, but also,
 you made the most amazing Scottish shortbread last night,
 accidentally.
  </li><li>Well, I mean, I didn't make it accidentally.
 I made it on purpose.
 But they're called Spritz cookies apparently.
  </li><li>Here?
  </li><li>Well, they're not technically a shortbread
 'cause a shortbread is a little denser
 and you would cut it with a cookie cutter.
 These are made with like a cookie press.
  </li><li>Well, they were delicious.
  </li><li>They taste like shortbreads, so don't they?
  </li><li>Yeah, but your ones are like tiny.
 It's got shortbread you could build houses from.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So if you could make them a little bit bigger,
 that would be one thing.
  </li><li>Yeah, I got a gift certificate to a cooking store
 for my birthday.
 And so I got a cookie press,
 so I could make cookies with the girls,
 and they had a riot making--
  </li><li>Which I'll tickle me impressed.
  </li><li>Tickle you impressed?
  </li><li>Or color me impressed, whatever the saying is.
 When you came home with it, I was like,
  </li><li>Okay, this looks like a rip off.
 It looks like total gimmicks that will never work,
 but oh my gosh, it's like 3D printing, but with dough.
  </li><li>Yeah, I was just pretty impressed with it.
  </li><li>But it's got texture and ridges and layers and peaks
 and I was super impressed.
 Did you use them all?
  </li><li>I only used three of the discs.
  </li><li>How many of them are there?
  </li><li>There's like 12 or something, so.
  </li><li>All right, well I see a full replica.
  </li><li>Yes, yes, yes.
 So it's the, if you're, if you are looking in cookie presses, it's the oxo one.
 Oh, like so I'll put a link in the show notes because I'm sure everybody wants
 to see.
 Well, it's quite, it's quite, I'm not a baker.
 I'm not a baker.
 So it has to be pretty easy and low maintenance for me to be willing to do it.
 But it is very impressive.
 Very impressive, very easy, easy to clean up.
 Loved it.
 All right.
 Yeah.
 Our main topic.
 Yes.
 But this week.
 Yes.
 Continue. I'm really enjoying the five things aspect.
 I don't know if I'm enjoying it because it's easier to come up with topics.
 Right.
 I hope you're enjoying it too.
 Give some feedback if you're not, or if you are,
 or if you want to suggest other topics that we could talk about.
 This week is five things we didn't know about therapy.
 Yes.
 And before we jump into it, it's worth noting that the term therapy is an umbrella
 term under which a vast variety of approaches to mental health or whole
 hard living could be found.
 Sure. We are not experts at all, nor are we trying to cover all aspects of therapy.
 Right. Largely, we're just talking about our experiences with, I guess, counseling.
 Yes. And further to that, because maybe you'll talk about this, you had some horrible experiences
 with counseling. Yes. Many years ago. Yes. So not all counseling or counselors are equal.
 Yeah, but you can't say that because that's one of my points.
 Okay, well, I'll let you have that. But what I was going to say is it's not like we have done
 Christian counseling. Right. And what I mean by that is, yes, all of the counselors that you and I
 have seen have been Christians. But their approach has been from a clinical classical training,
 that it's not like they're bringing... Well, I would say I've done both.
 You've done both. I mean, in recent years, the thing that we're learning about is not necessarily
 Christian counseling, theophastic, or veering into some of the inner healing stuff. Correct.
 It's our practitioners do have their own personal face with Jesus Christ, but they're using traditional
 counseling tools. Yes.
 That's what I want to say. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. Because you see the title you could think that
 we're talking about a wide variety of things. Some of you never even heard of. And there's lots of
 there's lots of tools that we have used. When you said have there. I know some
  </li><li>Ah!
  </li><li>I was like, you're breaching her.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Well, I'm thinking like we've both had heart sinks.
 We've both had, you know, sozo.
 We've both done the apostrics.
 And so, you know, RTF.
 So we've done all those things.
 Those would certainly be tools that we would still use
 if we-- - I'm still in door.
  </li><li>Yeah, right, right, right.
 But what we're talking about today
 is more traditional type of therapy.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Yes.
 There you go.
  </li><li>And we've got five each.
 Yes.
  </li><li>Did you wanna start?
  </li><li>Do you want me to start?
  </li><li>I don't mind.
 I will go wherever.
  </li><li>I'll start.
 'Cause then if you take mine,
 you have to come up with your own.
  </li><li>I like that.
  </li><li>Isn't that how that works?
  </li><li>Or we could just say, "I like the same thing."
  </li><li>Oh, I could do that all the way through then.
 I could just be like, "Those are my five things."
  </li><li>What I'm dealing with, she's cute, she's in pink,
 she makes a mean taco soup, but.
  </li><li>Okay, so things I,
 so I would say having had more Christian type
 type counseling. I would end up doing a lot of like theophastics and that kind of stuff.
 Explain theophastics to people who don't know what theophastics are.
 Theophastics is essentially like re going into a scene that is probably a scene from
 your life and asking Jesus, "Where are you in that scene?" And then having a conversation
 essentially with Jesus about what you're seeing, what's happening, what did he want you to
  </li><li>No. - Getting his perspective.
  </li><li>Getting his perspective.
 But I would say for me, sometimes that gave me license
 to not feel my emotions, right?
  </li><li>Sometimes.
  </li><li>Well, okay, many most, those, yes.
 So.
  </li><li>Which, by the way, I don't want to point out
 as a shortcoming of theophastics, I think it's.
  </li><li>It was what I, like, it was how I sort of was like,
 "Oh, I'll just invite Jesus in and Jesus will tell me the logic of why such and such
 thing happened and then I will feel my emotions for an appropriate amount of time, which is
 probably five to ten minutes."
 And then I will just move on knowing that, you know, whatever my truth is.
 Does that make sense?
 Yes, it makes perfect sense.
 Would you say that you and I have a similarity in that we prioritize not feeling our feelings
 as a way to keep her heart safe.
 Yes.
 OK, I don't want to make that true about you.
 Certainly true about me.
 Yes.
 Yeah. OK.
 So again, not a shortcoming of theophosphics per se, just our approach.
 And maybe having a revelation.
 And you being probably more on the logical like I would tend to lean towards
 in situations being more logical, linear rather than emotive.
 Right.
 And so I realized, oh, that's how I also did the apostrics or, you know,
 it's not that I didn't cry.
 But, you know, it's just like, you know, there's, I realized like I would assess
 everything with there's a reasonable amount of feeling a set emotion before
 you're now unreasonable and you should have just guessed it away.
 Yeah.
 I'm with you.
 So my number one is, is that healing is on the other side of feeling my emotions.
 Healing is on the other side of feeling your emotions.
 Yeah, because I would say I, and I mean feeling my emotions without putting a cap on what's the appropriate amount of time to feel it for.
 What is the appropriate amount of time?
 Well, it depends on the emotion in case you're wondering.
 No, I mean, but seriously, you know, I would sort of go, well, it's not appropriate to be angry.
 So I'm not going to feel angry because I'm a good Christian.
 Oh, but I did feel angry.
 Yeah.
 I just shoved it down, right?
 Did you know you were doing that?
 Did you know you were doing that or is that a new revelation?
 No, I mean, I, I knew I was doing it as a child into teenage.
 That's how I coped with everything.
 And I probably thought that I had gotten better at that because again,
 I would allow myself to feel angry for an appropriate amount of time, perhaps five
 minutes.
 Uh, and then I needed to be mature and be past, you know, whatever it was that I was
 feeling.
 Um, and I realized actually I probably really short circuited
 getting to healing faster for lack of a better explanation because I refuse to in the moment,
 just be able to feel how I feel and be okay with it.
 Do you remember when that revelation came to you? Oh, if I feel my feelings,
 there's something on the other side of that. That isn't pathetic.
 I would say, even if the feeling was justified, I was still angry that I was feeling instead of
 faith in. So you're angry at yourself for being human.
 Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Probably when I went to this age,
 hill training was when it started sort of shifting in terms of my
 understanding of it. But it was a slow, slow turning boat.
 I'm can I ask you questions? I guess I don't know if you've
 know what some her list, she doesn't know what's on mine.
 Okay.
 I'm so curious about what that shift looked like.
 Because I was with you on the weekend that we did the Seychelle training.
 And you weren't having a good time.
 No, I wasn't.
 I don't know.
 So my experience of you wasn't, my gosh, I'm learning some things and my heart is shifting.
 It was like a very different experience.
 Well, I think I think I wasn't having a good time because I had all kinds of emotions
 about what I was seeing and feeling and all that kind of stuff and nobody was doing
 Nobody was doing theophysics. Nobody was inviting Jesus in nobody was praying at the end to make everybody feel better
 Nobody and I was just like oh my gosh. This is irresponsible
 What has happened because it's not it wasn't my paradigm for how you help somebody process
 So it was irresponsible because you're making me feel feelings
 Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And then not not helping me just being like, yeah, I'm okay that you feel that. Well, I'm not okay that I feel that you psycho. So yeah.
 So yeah. Yeah, that was, I mean, that's when it started, but I would honestly say, I mean, that's three years ago now, isn't it? And.
 So what did you do with all of that?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Irresponsibility that they had inflicted upon you
 and now you're having feelings.
  </li><li>Well, I actually talked to my leader
 about how irresponsible I felt that this process was.
  </li><li>All right.
  </li><li>And they basically were like,
 and how do you feel about that?
 And I was like, oh, I just want to thump you right now.
 (laughing)
 You know, I think I've just expressed it.
 I think about it.
  </li><li>I have you in a chokehold.
 Does that express anything to you?
 Why don't you write an interpretive dance about
 how I'm feeling?
  </li><li>So yeah, I mean, I,
 Well, I don't know what you just asked me.
 I can't remember.
  </li><li>Well, so you very clearly stated
 that you had feelings about having feelings
 and that was new for you because what you just told me
 was in your theophastic moments,
 I had feelings in a clinical safe environment.
  </li><li>With like a trusted person.
  </li><li>And then it would go away and that was the point.
 I'll feel it and that's gone.
 And now you're on the other side of whatever journey
 you've been on saying, man, I totally missed it.
 I realized that if I allow my heart to feel,
 there is feelings on the other side.
 So you've told the story of having the feelings
 and it wasn't fun and you've told us there
 and now I realized that was good.
 What was the space between those two things?
  </li><li>Oh, like hard work of realizing really the issue
 is I want to be in control.
  </li><li>And having feelings feels like I'm not in control.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And of course I live with this guy.
  </li><li>You're looking. - All the time.
  </li><li>Athletic. - Good looking, athletic,
 great here. - Yeah, humble.
  </li><li>Okay.
 (laughs)
 Who is always like, well, how do you feel about that?
 And what do you need?
 And I realized those questions made me so angry
 because I couldn't logic those questions.
  </li><li>But again, they made me so angry.
 My experience of living with you wasn't that you felt
 you didn't display anger towards me about that.
  </li><li>Well, I managed to shut the heck up, George.
  </li><li>No, no, no, but I mean, I do manage myself in general.
 Like I'm not, I'm not a hugely demonstrative person.
 So even the things that I'm feeling inside,
 I'm probably gonna process those for a good deal of time
 before they come to the outside.
  </li><li>Did you mean angry, passionate or angry,
 shut up with your stupid feelings question?
  </li><li>Shut up with your stupid feelings question.
 I don't mean passionate, I just mean like, ugh.
 Just shut up with your stupid, sage-hoat questions.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Look at that.
 Which to be fair, they told us not to go home
 and use those questions,
 but I figured you'd already done the course.
 So we were both in the same boat.
 So we could not use them on people who hadn't done the course,
 but we could use them on each other.
 And of course I was like, I don't know,
 a year into this, two years into this,
 a year and a half at least.
  </li><li>And on one level, it was great
 'cause it kept pushing a button enough that I was like,
 oh, I think I want to go and actually get in therapy myself
 to see what I might not know about me.
  </li><li>Okay.
 And also, like my main thing was like sitting down with my therapist the first time I was
 like, my, you know, he's saying, what's your goal?
 And I'm like, my goal is to know what I need because I never know what I need because I
 don't remember being allowed to need.
 So that's huge.
 But even in that there's tons of emotion like I could cry right now, you know, so just
 realizing, okay, I historically I manage my emotion.
 Um, and, but I don't think I've done myself any favors by managing it the way that I have.
 Do you know what I mean?
 Like by essentially just hiding it and hoping it's going to go away and then it manifesting
 through your body and sickness.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 Thus all of last year.
 Mm hmm.
 So it's so profound.
 I mean, big worthy of a pause.
 When I hear you say, "I went to therapy because I realized I did not know what I need."
 And I'm just thinking about, I'm zooming out 100,000 feet and just thinking, "What sort
 of life can you live if you don't know what you need?"
 I mean, think about a child who doesn't know what they need, doesn't know that they need
 clothing or love or support or education or safety.
 And then, you know, now I know you.
 I don't think of you as someone who doesn't know what they need.
 And yeah, I also trust you when you when you say that.
 And I'm just thinking it out here and I'm trying to spitball here.
 I guess the way you got through life was watch what other people need
 and assume the things that they need.
 Oh, exactly. Yeah.
 So it wasn't like you were a basket case or uncontrollable,
 but you'd lost a sense of self of what does Alison Jean need?
 Or or in many, I mean, in many seasons need nothing
 so that you can't be disappointed.
 Like just, you know, because my, my needs were not famine oriented.
 Like my food was covered, my clothes, you know, I was fed and clothed and whatever.
 What am I going to complain about?
 Right.
 Exactly.
 Which is probably what your self talk.
 Right.
 Right.
 My needs are emotional.
 Um, you know, and, and just security and encouragement and all that kind of stuff.
 And just sort of went, you know what, it's way better to not have needs.
 Then you don't get continually disappointed.
 But what I what I trained myself to do is to not have needs and essentially be invisible.
 And so then when somebody asked me what my needs are, I, you know, I just realized I can't even answer that.
 I don't have a need.
 Right.
 But I don't have a need not out of a healthy place, but out of a I don't allow myself to have a need.
 Wow.
 That's a pretty big number one.
 Yeah.
 You ready for number two?
 Well, I mean, I think I, I like.
 I'm learning lots.
 Okay.
 I mean, we're talking about five things I didn't know about therapy.
 Yeah.
 That's a big one.
 Yeah.
 Like in many ways, that's a big thing I didn't know about myself.
 Yeah.
 And I didn't know that therapy would give you, I'm not trying to write your list, but I'm
 like, that's big.
 That's weighty.
 That's heavy.
 Yeah.
 Be sure.
 Give me number two.
 All right.
 Number two is not all therapists are created equal.
 So good.
 I'm packed.
 What do you mean by that?
 Well, I, many years ago, well, between doing like suicide, I mean, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
 doing like suicide support group, my dad killed himself and some stuff at church, which was
 very unhealthy for me. I had an eskema in my mind of this is what counseling looks like.
 And after several negative experiences, I was like, and I'll just do all of my inner
 healing me and God, much safer to keep these psychotic people out of my scenario.
 So and then, you know, I, of course, did the Sage Hill training.
 And while it pushed my buttons, I did think, oh, this is, you know, it was good.
 And then I did some group therapy.
 And that for me wasn't awesome.
 But not because of like anything specific, like in terms of not that the counselors, I
 didn't do one-on-one counseling with them. I don't know. Maybe they're amazing, you know.
 But for me, that group therapy scenario was not particularly the one that I was in what
 wasn't great for me. And then since starting to see my current therapist, which I started
 seeing him in June, I realized, oh, I leave feeling like I've been heard feeling like
 I've also been challenged to live differently.
 I just feel like a release from having been able to talk about things with somebody who feels safe.
 And my realization is I had so much fear going to see him because I had so many bad experiences before.
 And he's actually really redeemed that for me.
  </li><li>I fully agree with your point.
 In fact, your point made my list too.
  </li><li>Oh, see, combined points.
 I like it.
  </li><li>Yeah, great.
 Number three.
  </li><li>That group therapy and one-on-one therapy are different
 and produce different results.
  </li><li>You didn't know that before?
  </li><li>Well, for me before they were all just a bundle of,
 just wanna stay away from all of that nonsense.
  </li><li>I hear you.
  </li><li>Right?
  </li><li>Tell me about your experience.
  </li><li>Just all a negative soup.
 And so, you know, whether it was group therapy
 seemed like a magnification of something awful,
 which is therapy.
 Now we're going to add more people into that.
  </li><li>Which was when you were reacting when I came home
 and said, I think I'm gonna start group therapy
 where you just gefawed laughing.
  </li><li>Yeah, because I was like, I remember saying
 you couldn't pay me enough to do that.
 Which of course, a couple of years later,
 I signed up to try it.
  </li><li>That's how inner values work.
  </li><li>Rice, yeah.
 Rice.
  </li><li>Rice.
  </li><li>Rice.
  </li><li>But anyway, so like you were saying historically,
 it was all terrible.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Right, and now you've redeemed the experience
 of individual therapy.
  </li><li>Individual therapy, yeah.
 I'm only a fan of group therapy based on your experience.
 So like-- - To be fair,
 when you would describe what your group therapy experience
 was like. - Yeah.
  </li><li>It sounded like,
 that did not sound like group therapy,
 that sounded like a social club on your and outside
 and later to the party.
  </li><li>Right, and they did actually implode the group,
 you know, on purpose.
 They were like, we're gonna disband this group
 for, you know, they didn't--
  </li><li>So many reasons you call it out.
  </li><li>Yeah, so, you know, fair enough.
 But unfortunately I was, you know,
 part of that group for a little while,
 and I love individually, I loved all the,
 like ladies that were in it, it's not that,
 it was just the dynamic was, and as a feeler,
 it was so strange for me.
  </li><li>How different was your experience of group therapy
 that you went to privately on your own
 versus the group therapy that you did
 as part of the state show training.
 Like just compare those two experiences.
  </li><li>The one that was part of the training
 felt like it had way more structure to it
 and it felt more like people were leading it.
 The other one didn't feel like it was being led.
 It felt like it was sort of blown by the wind.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And again, because I'm like, I don't, you know,
 it makes sense that the one on the training weekend,
 which is like, you are going to go to group now
 and talk about this is gonna feel more structured.
 And I don't know what it's supposed to feel like
 in a healthy group when you're not on a training weekend.
 So I don't have like a comparison.
  </li><li>That makes sense.
  </li><li>And so you're saying the good example
 that you are perhaps eager to find out about,
 it's just from my experience, is that what you're saying?
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, you had so much great fruit
 from group therapy and you loved it
 and you'd get so excited about going
 where I would be like, I'm going
 because I said I would go and I'm hoping that I get something great out of it because Alan
 thinks this is amazing.
 And I've only ever done one group.
 I mean, I did it for two years and I only ever did one group.
 The people in the group cycled through, so in many ways it was a different group, but
 by and large we had the same, for the two years it was one, the same group leader was
 consistent.
 Yeah.
 And for a year it was one guy and for a year it was another guy.
 so there's some differences, but still,
 I don't know if I just struck gold
 and found the best group ever, TM,
 or whether it was my first experience,
 and I haven't done a different group therapy,
 and I'm almost too scared to for the same reason of,
 like, you guys aren't doing it the way I like doing it.
 And I don't wanna be that person,
 or maybe I do, I don't know, but yes.
 But it is interesting that the Lord
 has redeemed individual therapy for you.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I'm not the has to, like, you know, again,
 the important thing to understand that therapy,
 group therapy, is not a magic bullet.
 It's not the solution.
 It's not the only way to have whole hardness.
 It's just one facet of what, you know, is available to us.
 But I would be really passionate for everybody
 to have a group experience, like I had a group experience.
 But maybe they don't need it.
 Like maybe the reason I needed it was what I got from it
 and other people have already got that.
 So they might not need it.
 And I also have wondered more recently when I've thought about as much as I like to, as
 much as I'm like, oh, I'm more logical, you know, whatever.
 I'm still a feeler.
 Like that's one of the ways that I, you know, engage with my environment.
 And so for me to be with, you know, five or six other women that are all feeling big feelings
 And then, you know, not really know how to process all the things I'm feeling off of different people.
 That just, that's great.
 But would you ever talk about the feelings that you're feeling?
 Great for me.
 No, because I wasn't leading the group and I kept coming back to like, okay, if I'm here for me, does it help me to talk about what I feel like you're feeling and what's raining off?
 It kind of doesn't.
 See, for me, it would.
 Okay.
 I'd be like, I'm having this feeling about you
 and it's getting in the way of me being me.
 'Cause while you're all talking about this pretty little
 stuff, it feels like all this stuff's going on in your life.
  </li><li>Sure, babe, but I would have been doing that
 like every minute, like that wouldn't have been.
 Yeah, so for me, I think sitting in a room
 with only one other person and not, you know.
 Well, I'm just thinking like when I did group therapy,
 I wanted to not feel that would have made that so much easier,
 but that wasn't an option.
 I haven't figured out how to shut off anything
 when it's turned on.
 So, number four, me trying to figure out
 what he, my therapist is thinking about what I am saying
 is actually counterproductive.
  </li><li>Say that again from the dark.
  </li><li>'Cause I've done that.
  </li><li>So me trying to figure out what he is thinking
 about what I am saying is counterproductive.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>'Cause I realized that I was like,
 oh, I'm not actually engaging with me and what I feel
 when I'm spending time thinking about,
 what are you thinking about what I just said?
  </li><li>Do you ask him about that?
 Or do you follow you on that?
  </li><li>No, I just realized that that's what I was doing.
 And then I thought, this isn't gonna help me.
 Like this isn't gonna help me be present
 with how I'm feeling, which is why I'm here.
 I don't care what you're thinking really.
  </li><li>You got to that point way faster than I did.
  </li><li>Oh really?
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
 Like I remember like on the ninth month
 of individual therapy, my therapist said,
 it feels like you spend so much time in my seat
 that maybe you should just sit here
 and then you made me swap seats.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
  </li><li>And I was just doing that the whole time.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And again, that was an effort to make me feel safe.
  </li><li>Yeah, but I think also I'm confident
 that if my therapist is thinking something,
 he'll actually say it, like he'll call me on stuff.
 But I realized, yeah, I realized that had sort of become
 a protection mechanism, you know, like me thinking about
 what he's thinking about, what I'm saying
 actually allows me to disconnect from how I feel right now.
  </li><li>It's your go to thing to get away from you.
 What does it give you?
  </li><li>Well, to get away from my feelings, yes, yes.
  </li><li>What does it give you if you know what he's thinking?
  </li><li>Nothing.
 I mean, I don't know.
  </li><li>I don't know.
  </li><li>No, no, I just, you know,
 you were so aware that you were doing it
 and decided to stop doing it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Because you realized it was impeding your progress.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Clearly you were doing it for our reason.
 And that reason could just be habit.
 This is what all is done.
 But it could be like, you know,
 it makes me feel like I'm doing therapy right.
 Like am I even doing this right?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I'm looking at his face for cues
 as to whether this is going well.
 Like there's so many reasons
 and I don't know your reasons.
 So that's, I was just curious.
  </li><li>I don't know if I've isolated that.
 So, and then number five.
  </li><li>Wait, we're moving way too quickly.
 You don't want to stay with number four?
  </li><li>No, I don't. - I want to explore that.
  </li><li>Yeah, I don't.
 'Cause you know what?
 I'm not in therapy right now.
  </li><li>No, I'm just, okay, fine, whatever.
 I'll work with the boundaries.
  </li><li>And then number five was,
 so much healing comes from simple validation.
  </li><li>Unpack out during it.
  </li><li>Well, so I realized like one of my main difficulties
 when we did the Sage Hill Training was,
 you're having people, you know,
 right a list of the 10 most horrible things
 that happened to them and then share two of them.
 And I'm like, you're having people share
 two of their hardest things.
 And then nobody is praying for them,
 helping them process it, whatever,
 but they're saying,
 "Now, how do you feel about what AJ just said?"
 Or, "How do you feel about what bought?"
 And again, I felt like this is so irresponsible
 and how is this helpful to anyone?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Until I went.
 And I shared whatever, we had to read this.
 we had to write out one of our things.
 You know, what things, you know,
 we had to write out one of the things into like a story
 and we would put in like what did things smell like,
 what did they feel like, all that kind of stuff.
 Anyway, I read my things, sort of thinking,
 I don't, I wasn't thinking this is dumb.
 I just kind of wanted to get it over with.
 I wasn't really sure what I would get out of it.
 And I just thought, that's fine.
 I've done the assignment, check that box, you know,
 kind of thing.
 And read it.
 And at the end, looked up and there was two of the dad type
 people in my group, you know, like sort of one generation older
 that were crying.
 And both of them were like, I'm so angry
 that somebody did that to you.
 And I remember just feeling like, but like feeling
 the validation of, oh, yeah, that really wasn't OK.
 brought so much healing and still nobody prayed
 and nobody asked me where Jesus was when that was,
 you know what I mean?
 So I was like, oh, actually,
 I don't think I've realized how much validation
 actually helps people head towards healing
 because I just hid all the time.
 Like I didn't actually share what was happening with me.
 So I was thinking that and it's similar to
 We talk at church about sinking with one another,
 like sinking with somebody in the midst.
 And you're not trying to fix their pain,
 you're just saying, I'm really sorry,
 that really sucked or whatever the thing is.
 But sinking with them where they are.
 And I realized like I didn't realize how,
 I've done it with other people for them.
 But I haven't, I didn't realize how powerful it was
 for somebody to just validate,
 hey, that really wasn't okay.
 And for me, that ushered in the Holy Spirit
 being able to start to talk to me about, you know,
 you know, basically where I've aligned my expectations
 with disappointment and things like that
 because of like one memory.
 So, yeah.
  </li><li>Your eyes are all glassy.
 It's okay, I'm just gonna look away for a minute.
  </li><li>Okay, 'cause you felt for too long of an appropriate moment.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>That's right, I felt my sadness for an appropriate
 two and a half minutes.
  </li><li>Aww, that makes me sad.
 I feel sad just joking about that.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>It is powerful, isn't it?
 The whole thing of being with somebody,
 just creating a space for them to be,
 and be with them in that.
  </li><li>And not fixing it, nobody tried to fix it,
 'cause I think sometimes we feel like a pressure
 to like somebody tells you something really hard
 and really, or really sad.
 And as particularly those Christians,
 we wanna throw a scripture verse at it.
 Well, let me pray for you.
 Or let me, and really, some of us sometimes we're saying,
 "Well, let me help you disconnect from feeling bad
 "because I feel uncomfortable," or whatever.
 And actually-- - It's not even care for them.
 It's all about us.
 Let me help you disconnect from it
 so you don't have feelings
 so I don't have to have feelings about your feelings.
  </li><li>Right, right.
 So actually just having people go, oh, that was awful, you know, and not fix it, not pray for me, not whatever.
 But actually it did so much good.
 So yeah, that's all I was thinking.
 Yeah, it's beautiful.
 What great list, AJ Jones.
 Yes.
 I love being with you.
 I nailed my list.
 Thank you.
 I did.
 I really loved hearing some of that.
 Thank you.
 And I loved getting to hear about your journey because we've talked a little bit about it.
 You know, through the years, but it's nice, nice.
 But I feel really connected to you.
 I feel really intimate hearing that side of your story.
 All right, you ready for my five?
 I am number one.
 Number one.
 I wasn't aware of the significant differences
 and the similarities between inner healing and counseling or inner healing and therapy.
 OK.
 So I think, you know, we were talking about doing
 say chill training. I think for a lot of us, because you know, a lot of our team went to this thing
 and run by, you know, trained clinicians. And probably we all had varying degrees of
 questions, curiosity about like, Hey, why do you all do this? But then don't do this. Right.
 And I realized in many ways, were, you know, the clinical psychology or the, you know,
 you know, family therapy and counseling and inner healing are trying to scale the same
 mountain, which is whole-hearted living.
 Right.
 Like from a Christian perspective, we want everybody, we want everybody to receive everything
 that Jesus paid for, for, you know, the clinical model.
 It's like, oh, yeah, we actually want you to be able to not just function, but live
 full-heartedly.
 Yeah.
 And we're coming at it from two different directions.
 And I was so curious about why they didn't do half the stuff that we did.
 Me too.
 And then also realized in hindsight that a lot of the stuff that we did from an inner
 healing world didn't give you what they offered.
 Right.
 And previously I didn't value what they offered.
 Right.
 Because, oh, you like, it felt like, and again, I am not laying the blame at inner healing.
 This could be my view of these tools.
 So please don't hear me.
 I think every model except for Jesus is going to be limited.
 No matter how good it is, it's going to be limited.
 And I actually think they're designed to work really well altogether.
 I absolutely agree.
 But I think historically my approach to inner healing was, what's your problem?
 Let's fix it. Boom, problem gone.
 Which is not how anything ever works.
 Whereas I would and to be fair, I could have approached
 counseling in the same way.
 Yes.
 Um, if I got to that first, perhaps, who knows?
 But all I know is that when I got to counseling,
 I was just so frustrated by the process
 because it was just like, why aren't you fixing things?
 Like it was my biggest complaint because my therapist
 would be like, let's be curious together.
 I'd be like, no, no, no, let me write you a check.
 Let's you the expert, find out what's wrong,
 and then let's work to fix it.
 Because when I call a plumber--
  </li><li>I don't wanna be curious.
  </li><li>I don't wanna be curious.
 I wanna write my check and make the problem go away.
 (laughing)
 And counseling or a good counselor
 is not going to approach life that way at all.
 So I just didn't realize those differences.
 And I remember God bless Stephen James,
 the CEO of Sage Hill.
 I remember our senior team from Grace and I went
 and met with him to say,
 "We've dipped the toe of, you know,
 "and we've dipped our toes in your pond.
 "And here are some questions.
 "What about this?
 "And what about that?
 "And what about this?
 "And he was so patient to answer our questions,
 "to help us discover, I don't know,
 "the goal, the limitations inherent in each model."
 And it was very, very helpful.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So there's significant differences with the approach,
 but there's also significant similarities
 in that we are after wholehearted living,
 and I don't think I can emphasize this again.
 The goal of this podcast is not like,
 "Yay, therapy's good and boo,
 "interhealing's bad at it."
  </li><li>No, I think he means both.
  </li><li>I would say that everything is,
 everything we're talking about is just a facet
 to getting what Jesus already paid for on the cross.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>That would be my number one.
 I was not aware,
 And I could probably unpack that a little bit more in terms of like all the different things.
 You know, the parallel I came up with while thinking about this is the difference
 between praying for people to be healed and going to a doctor or a hospital.
 It's not either or God wants sick people well.
 And, you know, we shouldn't criticize any methodology that's used to reach that goal.
 Yeah.
 With me.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Number two, I did not know.
 You try to look at my notes.
 Well, I realized like you write full on paragraphs and I wrote like a point form
 for each one.
 Well, I'm a verbal processor.
 And so when I'm verbally processing, I write down what I hear.
 I didn't know how much I needed a space to receive.
 Yeah.
 Like I remember like the reason I went was I'd lost my mom and my dad in the space
 of two years.
 Yeah.
 And you know, I'm having some feelings for my information.
 Let's just go see this guy.
 Let's do some Greek Therapace and make it go away and get on with my life.
 Right.
 And I was completely missing the gift that was given to me.
 Yeah.
 Because I didn't value feelings.
 I didn't value knowing what I felt so that I would know what I needed.
 I didn't value any of that.
 Where are you trying to hold on to yawn?
 Yeah, okay, just let it out.
 It's just easier.
 No, your line's going to explode if you hold on to yawn.
 There you go.
 Look at that.
 I did not know the value and the gift,
 and I would encourage everybody, especially leaders,
 to have a window where they're there not leading themselves.
 They're allowing themselves to be led.
 Yeah. It's certainly, it's really helpful when the whole rest of your world is leading others or
 being responsible for others and giving output, whether it's as parents being in ministry, all
 that kind of stuff for sure. Yeah. One of the reasons I was so fanatical about group therapy
 was it was an hour and a half every week where nobody was looking for my input.
 Yeah. Like our jobs were often required to give input answers, reasons, insight per, you know, like that's our job.
 People are drawing on us to speak into situations.
 Yeah. And I love my job. Yeah.
 But to go for a year, for a year and a half, nobody even knew what I did for a living.
 Nobody cared. Yeah.
 To be in a room where I'm, you know, not a voice that people want to hear from. Yeah.
 Unless I got something to share was absolutely wonderful. Yeah.
 And then even one-on-one counseling to go there and just to have a space each week.
 And actually, the story's about you and it's supposed to be about you,
 rather than trying to do this fake humility thing. Because what I learned in therapy is everything
 is always about us. We're all as humans, incredibly narcissistic. That's sin right there. But we
 develop these skills to make it look like it's about you so that we can hide our shame about
 about it want to be about me and the gift of going for therapy is it's like one week
 and it is about you and if you try and make it about the therapist if they're good they'll
 be like we're not here to talk about me like what do you need to talk about you yeah so
 I didn't know how much I needed that and I think that whole thing was was humility
 in action like if you can embrace and it sounds backwards about if you can embrace this hours
 about you and you need it to be about you I became a better husband and father and leader
 because of the time I allocated there.
  </li><li>I agree.
  </li><li>You do? - Yeah.
  </li><li>All right, number three.
 This was the same one that you had.
 Your therapy is only as good as your therapist.
  </li><li>Well, you said it different, but sure.
  </li><li>Well, I wanna qualify that because all the data out there
 says in the country,
 it doesn't matter your therapist or the type of therapy
 or the this or that,
 what is actually the greatest determinator
 of the success of therapy is the commitment of the client.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>The willingness of the client to show up and do the work
 is the single biggest factor in determining
 how effective therapy will be.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>That's what like multiple reports have said.
 I would argue that even if that's true,
 the skill level of the therapist
 is gonna determine the fruit of the therapy system.
  </li><li>I think so.
  </li><li>And I don't have an extensive experience,
 as much as you in having bad therapists, but just in speaking to people who've been in
 therapy or speaking to people who are sharing some of their experiences.
 And I have been to some where I'm just like, what are you doing to find a skilled therapist
 who meets what you need?
 And sometimes it really doesn't have to do with their skill per se, but maybe their personality
 or what you're looking for or what you need in that season.
 Right.
 And it might be different from season to season for sure.
 Absolutely.
 My encouragement with that is if you've had a bad experience with a therapist or bad
 experience with therapy, can I encourage you to give it another go?
 Because as age you said, you don't know what healing is waiting for you on the other side
 of doing the work.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Number four, I love this.
 Number four, as I was reflecting on this, like, what did I not know about therapy?
 Was that number four is my head helped my heart find its voice?
 Oh, that's cool.
 Now ironically, going to my head was actually one of my defense mechanisms.
 When I feel like I'm challenged, when I feel like I'm being threatened, when I feel overwhelmed,
 let's just leave my heart, leave all those feelings that feel like I'm going to be suffocating
 and drowning and go to my head and just logic, rationalize, debate my way out with it.
 Throw bombs from there.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 And I'm really good at it.
 You are.
 Very good.
 I've had plenty of training in it.
 Yeah.
 And I'm at my best when I'm scared and my back's against the wall and just give me access to the
 internet. And I'll be back in 30 seconds and I'll wipe the floor with you.
 All right. And at what, like, you can imagine that produces a very lonely
 existence. Yes. So ironic that the very defense mechanism that kept me isolated
 was the very gift that brought me healing. Okay. And so what I mean by that is
 being in therapy for like, I don't know, eight or nine months, and feeling like
 I'm getting nowhere and then going to the Sage Hill weekend, the Sage Hill training,
 where they kind of explained some of the magic behind the process.
 Like, this is what we try to do when we're with a client.
 This is how addiction cycles work.
 This is how your feelings work.
 This is how your brain processes emotion.
 This is what separation does to a child.
 This is what your family of origins done.
 This is what your family systems have brought up that you keep living out.
 Like having a excuse the word schema before, but having a framework, a grid to
 understand stuff that somehow I do that I can see myself doing that I understand
 that works I know what that's like I can it like my brain understood it so that
 my heart could engage with it like I've joked before you know we did the
 whole thing about Chip Dodd's book on The Voice of the Heart yes I read that
 book and I threw it across the room I thought it was garbage I hated the book
 I really did I told Chip that and then once I started doing the work around
 that. I think the combination of doing the work around it but also having it explained to me
 in a way that I could understand it actually made my head value which allowed my heart to
 experience it. Yeah, that makes sense. And I'm really grateful for my brain that kept me safe all
 those years and it did did a good job but I'm also really really grateful that it had capacity
 to understand a different way and allow my heart to speak from time to time. So good.
 I don't know if you're just frozen you just think so cool but i was thinking you said and you said schema earlier and i thought i don't even think i use that word so i doubt it but okay.
 I like the year i'm gonna i'm gonna put a replay right now i had an askema in my mind of this is what counseling looks like okay i need it i like the year to be nice big words to me very short word well it sounds intelligent.
 There you go. We were with some friends last weekend and we were talking and I so related to my friend who shared a story about
 How he decided he didn't want to have feelings?
 Because he looked at the lives of the people whose lives were run by feelings and thought I don't want to be like you
 And that was my experience like people who had lots of feelings were at best spiritually or intellectually immature. I don't believe that
 I did I totally believed that and judged it so I don't want to be like that
 Like most of the people who are being emotional believe that now believe that absolutely believe that I was a huge judgment
 Yeah, and probably because most of the people who are having a meltdown were because they're having big feelings about it
 You know and if they just get their act together, then they wouldn't feel that thing and then they could just move on
 Right, you know, so that was very robust thinking for me
 And as one person in group therapy once said to me
 "Oh, I bet that's made you really, really effective at work."
 But probably kept you and everybody around you really, really lonely.
 That's like, shut up.
 Yeah.
 All right, number five.
 Yeah.
 I'm still learning this.
 By the way, all these things, I haven't learned and they're in the past and now I've
 met you at past them.
 Right.
 I still am learning them and revisiting them.
 But number five would be, I did not know how much of your childhood story repeats itself
 through your life.
 Oh, wow.
 Yeah.
 we have the same in the inner healing world.
 If your reaction to an event is far larger
 than the event warrants, then the issue isn't the issue.
  </li><li>Right. - Right.
  </li><li>So if I say to you, if you say to me,
 "Honey, can you pass the catch up?"
 And I unreasonable, or if I just explode,
 I'm like, "Did your own catch up?"
 But I can't believe you'd ask me this.
 Like the issue isn't about age you're asking me
 to get the catch up.
 The issue's about something different.
 The issue's not the issue.
  </li><li>Right, and so Chip says though.
  </li><li>Well, Sage Hill would teach us that
 When you have a reaction larger than the event
 would warrant a reaction, you've gone home.
 You've gone home, you've revisited your childhood story.
 Again, going back to the Sage Hill training that we can,
 where we got to explore a number of different models
 for looking at how you've ended up,
 the way you've ended up.
 One of the things they talked about was,
 you know, your family system.
 So how you grew up and what roles you played.
 And so you can go Google this.
 But there's the mascot, the lost child, the hidden child,
 the enabler, the addict.
 There's all roles in families.
 And we've probably played a bunch of those roles
 through different stages of our life.
 And what I learned from doing that,
 and being in therapy and in individual therapy
 and in group therapy is, oh, I'm replaying the roles
 I learned to excel at in childhood.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Can we go say something?
  </li><li>I was just gonna say, yeah, I mean, my therapist
 will often say to me, especially when I'm curious
 about a reaction or whatever,
 and I've just talked about a circumstance and he'll say,
 and is that familiar to you?
 You know, like--
  </li><li>They're asking you to go home?
  </li><li>Yeah, asking me to, right, to look at home.
  </li><li>I remember one time I was in group therapy.
 I think I've told the story before on the podcast,
 but I remember I asked,
 I kind of smarted off us against somebody.
 And one of the group leaders rightly said,
 "I don't know what you're feeling."
 And I just dismissed this question,
 like, "I'm not feeling anything."
 Even though I just had a reaction to this guy,
 and I'm trying to backpedal out of the eye
 when I was reaction, no, I'm totally fine,
 you know what I'm wrong.
 And so, and then I'm like kind of fuming at the guy
 that asked me, and so like, I go after him.
 Oh yeah, well, what about this, and what about that?
 And then the other guy comes in and is like,
 "Amen, what are you feeling when you're asking
 "so and so these questions?"
 And, you know, I'm having really big feelings about this,
 and I'm aware I'm having really big feelings,
 and I'm feeling lots of shame
 that I'm having these feelings without my permission.
 And so I go away and I think about it,
 and I come back the next week
 and I have a confrontation for those two group leaders.
 Because I felt like as I was going after one guy,
 the other guy stopped me going after him.
 And I'm like, you know,
 what are you so scared about me going after him?
 Yada yada yada.
 And so as I'm retelling the story,
 I can see all these confused faces
 on the people in the group.
 And I'm like, why are all your faces confused?
 And they're like, Alan,
 the events that you're describing happened.
 like the conversations you're describing happened,
 the reactions that you're saying
 that these key players had did not happen.
 And I realized those reactions were so real to me,
 and I would swear on a stack of Bibles,
 that's exactly what happened.
 I haven't exaggerated a little bit,
 like that's ever happened.
 And yet I have to bear witness and recognize
 that six people observed this dialogue
 and none of them share the same experiences with me.
 What's happened?
 I've just gone home.
 I've made one of them my father, one of them my mother,
 and I'm replaying an experience.
  </li><li>And the rest of them are your sisters.
  </li><li>I'm replaying an experience from my childhood
 and it says real.
 And when we broke that down, I was like,
 "I can't believe I'm doing that."
 And it made me think, not only is that familiar,
 but does that happen a lot?
 And I'm like, that shows up in our relationship,
 shows up at work, it shows up with friends,
 and it shows up in group.
 And the beauty of group is it's like this
 kind of like little sandbox, so to speak,
 where your childhood issues will just show up.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>No matter how hard you work out,
 work against them showing up, they will.
  </li><li>Sure, sure.
  </li><li>And so I think one of the things that therapy
 has given me is that awareness that even as a 47, 48,
 how old am I?
  </li><li>You're 47.
  </li><li>47 year old man, my childhood story is still playing out
 and how helpful is it to A, know that and B,
 address some of the things that keep you from going home.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Can I tell you another story?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>This is literally about going home.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>What would happen every time I would go home,
 literally to my family of origin with you?
 Do you remember? - Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>What would happen?
  </li><li>You would revert to like behavior,
 I didn't recognize at all.
 I'm like, what happened to the calm person
 that I married to.
  </li><li>I would just retreat, why?
  </li><li>Yeah. - 'Cause it was my safest thing to do.
  </li><li>It was what you did at your home.
  </li><li>Was, would treat, so just the geographical cues,
 the biological markers that smell of the fabric software
 in my house would just, I would just retreat.
 And similarly, when social circumstances are set up
 that would mirror my family environment,
 I'll play one of the roles.
 Or historically it would.
 Now I've got like different options.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So it's like, oh, that stuff is fascinating
 and would not have known without therapy.
 Yeah, it's amazing.
  </li><li>So there you go, that was my five things.
 I do wanna reiterate and be very, very clear
 that therapy counseling is just one other tool
 that God can use to ensure
 that you get everything Jesus paid for.
 We're still huge fans of RTF, of heart sync, of inner healing.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>All the umbrella that comes under it.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>That's something we still teach, still value,
 we're still encouraged to get.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But would also encourage you, if you need to,
 and as your friend about it.
  </li><li>Should we feel stuck?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Seek out a great counselor or therapist to help you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>All right.
 AJ Jones.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>You ready for a listening question?
  </li><li>I think so.
  </li><li>Well, you don't know,
 'cause I haven't read it to you yet.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Okay, my big complicated words like schema in it.
  </li><li>Oh.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>All right, this is from Chris.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>All right.
 And Chris says this,
 "I've been through Finding Father once last year,
 and I'm going through for the second time.
 In the season, I have learned to soak
 and enjoy the Father's presence.
 We have a baby on the way.
 So do we?
 So now my question is, how do I maintain the walk and growth in the spirit
 as the troubles and trials that people speak of will be coming?
 Thanks.
 Now, before you answer, can you explain to everybody what Finding Father is?
 So Finding Father is the book that I wrote.
 And the video course that we have.
 That is a daily Bible study, a 12 week daily Bible study.
 So first of all, Chris, while done going through the second time, that's so great.
 Um, well, I mean, I think the first thing that I want to talk about, you know, where I'm going is, is I, I would encourage you don't align your expectations with trials and troubles being synonymous with having a baby.
 Correct.
 Um, we, that was not my experience with any of our three babies.
 And I had, they were all preemie.
 Well, I guess technically we managed to make
 MJ go full term to the, you know, to the definition.
 But, you know, we had a lot of things
 that technically would be stacked against us.
 And in terms of like, you know, being, being preemie,
 or as preemie as they were.
 And actually, I loved every, every season of them being little.
  </li><li>Now do paint a realistic picture.
 You're not saying that nothing will change in your life.
  </li><li>No, oh no, everything is gonna, yeah.
 I mean, for sure-- - Everything is gonna change.
  </li><li>For sure, like, I remember when we got married,
 I had a huge revelation of how selfish I am.
 I had, and then you sort of like simmer down
 to like maybe a less level of selfishness,
 but you don't realize that you're still selfish
 until a little person wants all of your time.
 And then you realize, oh, it's still there.
 So yeah, I mean, there was,
 how your time is spent is different.
  </li><li>But you wouldn't classify that as trials
 tribulation and troubles. I would know. I would say that sort of normal growth.
 Reframe that because you don't want that as an expectation. Yeah. Like we would
 often have people say, you know, when we found out they're pregnant people be like,
 Oh, well, you know, it's the last lie and you'll ever have for 17 years. Just like,
 get rid of the negative expectations. Be understand yet your life is going to
 change. But one of the best pieces of advice we ever got was from a friend of
 Trish Boots, who said, "Kids will fit into your life if you'll let them."
 Yeah.
 With Abigail, we traveled all over the world preaching. Literally, by the time she turned
 one, she'd been in 18 nations, been 106 flights. We were good. We were doing what we were called
 to do, and Abi was good. She was loving it.
 We dealt with private tribulations. We recognized your life will change.
 Yeah, it will change.
 And yeah, you're gonna, you know,
 yes, you get less sleep in the same amounts of time
 that you want them and all that kind of stuff.
 But those are short seasons of that.
 And so how do you like maintain like soaking
 and things like that with a little one?
 I think you take each day as it comes,
 you give yourself lots of grace
 and your baby is gonna be napping three or four times a day.
 you could soak one of the times when they're napping.
 You know what I mean?
  </li><li>You're soaking my turn into sleeping real quick.
  </li><li>But that's okay.
 You know, so I think you just sort of say,
 okay, Holy Spirit, what's my strategy for today
 to get some time with you, to get to soak
 and you know, press into you.
 And then if the day sort of blows up,
 which some days do blow up
 because that's the nature of having a little one at home,
 we'll then try again tomorrow.
 But so my thing would be give yourself tons of grace,
 realize that this season of lots of sleep-nesses
 and stuff like that, that's pretty short.
 And yeah, just ask the Holy Spirit for help
 in how to accomplish what you wanna accomplish.
  </li><li>Be kind to yourself.
 And what you've got, the growth you've got is yours to keep
 and you can always build on it.
 And life is gonna look differently and that's okay.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, I'm just thinking when I was single,
 before we even were married.
 When I was home, I would have regularly,
 my God time was five to six hours a day.
 I haven't had a season that looked like that again.
 Now, you know, that was for a couple of years,
 then we got married, then now somebody else is in your house,
 so now it looks a little bit different,
 and then babies come along,
 and then it looks real different again.
 And so just give yourself lots of grace
 for when things change, the Holy Spirit has a plan
 and ability to help you come up with a way of doing it.
 But just be aware, extend yourself grace.
 It's not a competition.
  </li><li>Yeah, it makes me think that maybe you should make
 Finding Father into an audio book
 so people can listen to it as well as read it.
 Because most of your reading is through audio books.
  </li><li>That's true.
  </li><li>Just thought of a project we could do this week.
  </li><li>Oh, this week!
  </li><li>Yeah, you ready to-- - Thanks for the week,
 let's do it!
  </li><li>Do you want to record Finding Father?
  </li><li>No.
