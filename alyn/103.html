<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is Mrs.
 aj Jones.<br/>
 Hello sir.<br/>
 You look perplexed.<br/>
 Oh, I was just wondering what these colorful things were on this court.
 The colorful things.<br/>
 And this is going to mean nothing to people who are listening because they can't see it is to help me identify which microphone, which speaker goes to which input on the mixer.
 Ah, clever. So instead of like writing on the wire with tape that gets sticky and comes off,
 you have color labeled them. Color coded labels, yes.
 Excellent. I highly approve. Oh, good. Your shaper is happy. Yes. Talk to me about your visits
 to the doctor this week. Oh, well, I went to the doctor Monday morning because I had like a large
 Freckle that was<br/>
 being larger. It was a colony of freckles. No, it was one freckle. No, no, a freckle is like one little dot. This was like
 20 dots went to fight another 20 dots and they got in a fight and a lot of freckle blood was filled. The size of a dime.
 Yes, it's a village of freckles. Okay, and
 anyway, I a couple of years ago I had gone and they had said, oh,
 You want to get those things frozen off because they can be pre-cancerous. So just get rid of them ahead of time
 And so I guess I hadn't realized how big it had gotten so I went and he said yeah
 I would freeze it off and I said oh okay, and he said fact I'll do it right now
 I was like that's great. I did tell him that I wanted to punch him well
 That's the only way to treat medical professionals
 He's like you're doing very well, and I said but in my mind I want to punch you and he's like I appreciate you not punching me
 So anyway, he thought it was funny.<br/>
 And how's your face now?<br/>
 Much better.<br/>
 It was itchy for a few days.<br/>
 It was sore for like a couple of hours.
 It went into horrible blister that people came up to you.
 Church and said, is that on tree?<br/>
 You OK?<br/>
 And I was like, guys, I'm sitting right here and Ron said to a bunch of people were like,
 Hey, what's going on with your face?<br/>
 Aside from the horrible overtones that you're suggesting there.
 She's fine.<br/>
 I'm fine.<br/>
 Abigail are how old is Abigail?<br/>
 Nine.<br/>
 Yeah, I stopped counting after seven.<br/>
 Okay, Abigail, our nine year old got braces for her teeth and one of the things she has is an
 expander that goes, I'd never seen one before basically amounts to your back teeth and forms a
 metallic arch in the roof of your mouth. But what I didn't know was that we were going to be in
 for a treat is every two days, we have to turn a key. I mean, it's literally like medieval torture.
 You put this key into this mechanism and you twist it and it slowly pushes her teeth out,
 which sounds barbaric enough. We're torturing our child. That's what you're saying.
 Well, what's horrendous is trying to fit this fiddly little key into her tiny little mouth without stabbing her because,
 yeah, it's, I'm sure I'm going to get better at it after having done it many, many times, but right now I'm not enjoying the process.
 Oh, she doesn't seem to care. She's not in any pain.
 That's good. I'm so glad.<br/>
 Well, I give her an Advil shot before I do it.
 You do?<br/>
 No.<br/>
 Talk to me about your frustrations this week because it seems like the last couple of weeks I've had frustrations getting our
 technology to work, which so far so good is back from our supplier. It seems to be working fine.
 Yeah.<br/>
 But you had your own fair share of frustrations. Talk to us about that.
 Yeah, having frustrations with the printer of the boy named Ben book.
 So the one that we just released and lots of customers bought.
 Yeah, the one that we bought a bunch of books for.
 So we've shipped them out and then what did you find during the week?
 that they've messed up the fold. Basically, the inside edge is messed up and in contacting
 the printer, they were like, "Well, it is possible because we had done several proofs
 to make sure we had a perfect book before we ordered them."
 Which is the point of a proof?<br/>
 Right. Well, apparently, according to them, it's possible to get a perfect proof and still get a
 messed up printing because of some, I don't know,
 evil fairies at the printing press or something.
 So we're, but they're basically saying
 they're not gonna do anything about it.
 So it's pretty frustrating.
</p><ul>
  <li>Wow.
 Yes and no.
 I mean, we haven't really dialogued with them.
 They basically sent banks
 that hey, we're not gonna do anything about it.
 And then we investigate some more and we're not gonna,
 yeah, we're gonna try and do something this week,
 but this week's also the more conference.
 But anyway, it's frustrating.
 I'm sure everybody's got their own version of that.
 Yeah.
 You're probably not printing books, or maybe you are,
 but you know, where people are like,
 "Nope, not our fault."
 And you're like, "No, I'm pretty sure I paid you large
 " sums of money to do it right."
 And because I wasn't involved in the printing process,
 I guess the only person that could be involved
 would be, wait for it, wait for it, it would be you.
 That's right.
 And it kills me that we've sent out books
 that I didn't realize weren't perfect.
 What we're gonna do is we're gonna send out an email
 in the next few days to all the customers
 who've bought a buy name ban to have a look at it.
 If yours is an unacceptable level, there'll be a link in the email you just let us know
 and when we get new ones that are properly printed, we'll replace it obviously for free.
 Yeah, to clarify, it's not the spine, it's the inside pages.
 There's a couple of them where the words don't line up in that kind of stuff.
 Yeah.
 So that's frustrating, I'm sorry.
 Yeah.
 You had your face frozen off and your books were printed wrong.
 And I just started crying because I was like, this is just not okay.
 And what did I do to cheer you up?
 Let's try the sexy dance.
 Okay.
 Yeah, it always works for me, maybe the sexy dance.
 All right.
 You lost toneil doing that one time.
 You should be careful.
 Oh, we see, we need to start a separate podcast.
 Remuried people.
 Well, yeah, for people who want to be horrified by the stories that we can't tell to the
 general public.
 They're all going to be wondering now, what is this sexy dance and how did your toneil
 get removed while doing it?
 Well, it's just a cliffhanger, folks.
 Yeah, I apologize for the visual fingers in the room that you're thinking of meeting
 in sex with us.
 Let's move on.
 Our main topic for this week, baby, yes, I wanted to go through the feedback that we received.
 So about two weeks ago, we passed our 100th episode.
 And so as we like to do every year about every 50 episodes, we like to put up a little
 survey where our listeners can let us know what they like, what they don't like, how you
 found this blah, blah, blah, blah.
 And I don't know whether it's just me, but I'm a total serving nerd.
 I love feedback.
 I love data.
 I love coming through it all.
 And I thought I would give you the listeners the feedback on the feedback
 that we received.
 I'm, I'm so excited.
 I haven't actually seen this feedback.
 I know.
 So it's going to be brand new to you.
 If you would like to follow along at home, we have got a page, which I'll put a
 link in the show notes because I haven't decided the URL yet, where you can look
 at the pretty graphs and see the data for yourself.
 We're going to talk through some of the feedback that you gave us.
 Here we go.
 AJ Jones, take us away.
 Well, the first thing I'm looking at says, which country do you listen from?
 The vast majority, probably three quarters of the USA looks like
 just under a quarter from the UK.
 And then there's an other section.
 Would you like a secret tip on how to see the percentages?
 I would.
 off of your mouse over a part of the bagel or the donut.
 -Okay, 96% USA.
 -That would be 76% USA.
 -That's correct.
 [laughter]
 19% UK and 5% others.
 -Why don't you call it the colors and I'll do the numbers, okay?
 -Okay.
 Do you have any last confidence because I confused a 9% for 7?
 -No, no, it's all.
 -Okay.
 -I was the two of us.
 Who's better at math?
 -I am.
 -By far.
 I was the two of us who's worse at math.
 You are.
 Yeah.
 I'm, I've always had a mental block and mental arithmetic.
 I used to work in a news agents at six o'clock in the morning and people would
 come in and do it by the cigarettes and I couldn't work out the change.
 You know, it would be like two thirty six and they'd give me three dollars and
 I'd be like, uh, uh, uh, uh, wow.
 And it would just get worse, worse and worse, sir.
 Oh dear.
 That's, that's very not good.
 No, it wasn't good at all.
 Yeah.
 So remarkably, 76% of our listeners, I should say there's about 100 people that responded.
 That is not a statistically significant sample, but it's all we have.
 Right.
 So it's what we're going to have.
 So if you hear me say 76% of our listeners, 76% of the people who listen to podcast,
 who decide to give us feedback.
 Yeah.
 There we go.
 So that's out of the way.
 But as you say, three quarters of our peeps listen from America.
 America.
 You know what is sad babies are Canadian quotient has gone down.
 I know where my peeps at you need to represent.
 I don't know.
 I just it's probably because we don't see the national anthem.
 Just a second.
 Oh, Canada.
 Our home and native land.
 Come on, sing with me to be to love in all our own.
 OK, how is that going to help people who don't listen to the podcast?
 start listening to podcast they're going to just feel it okay it's like a dog whistle in the end so we can feel it we just know when another Canadian is just doing their thing that's amazing yeah it is all across the nation right now people are putting down their protein.
 I'm not doing this is just wait wait just see what the statistics okay that's crazy.
 One of the things that confused me last year was I was surprised how many people don't use a podcast app to listen to our podcast.
 That's really that you that's dropped this year.
 Do you want to try the numbers?
 I can do them.
 OK, go for it.
 OK, we have 81% using a podcast app.
 We have 13% using the website.
 Does that mean they're just downloading directly from Alan?
 No means they just go to alanajoe.com and just play in the browser.
 Oh, about 4% actually download it and listen to it offline.
 at a later time.
 I got you and 2% pretend they know what we talked about
 in Whistle in a forest.
 What is the 2% of other?
 I'd have to look at it, but it's 2% so I didn't care.
 OK, but I want it to be statistically representative.
 OK, because if you add up 81 plus 13 plus 4 plus 2, you get to 100.
 Good job, darling.
 But to leave the two off, somebody would email and go, and it's not quite right.
 Doesn't that have to be criminal, wouldn't it?
 Yeah. Yeah.
 So what confused me is I think a year ago, a lot of people were listening to the website
 because perhaps they're new to podcasts and they didn't know that the receipts,
 things called podcast apps were it would automatically download to your phone.
  </li><li>It's a beautiful thing.
  </li><li>And this year, what I love about the software you use for doing feedbacks,
 I can't believe I'm nerding out about this, but what I love about the software you use for
 getting feedback is everybody who went through it would see different questions depending on the
 answers that they answered to previous questions.
  </li><li>Oh wow.
 So there was lots of nested questions.
 Like if you answered yes on this, then you'd get a whole lot of other questions that you
 might not see if you have.
 Lots of if then statements going on.
 So I asked the people, hey, when you listen on the website, are you actually aware that you can download
 if you wish to or or why do you listen on the website?
 And I finally got an answer that made sense to me.
 Why people said, well, when I'm at work, I'm not allowed to have my phone, my personal phone at work,
 but I'm using a computer all day and there's nothing everybody listens to music so I just plug headphones in load up a web page and listen to your book.
 I was like sure genius of course that makes sense.
 Somebody was telling me that the other day I think they just found our podcast and so you know they work in eight hour day and they're like yeah.
 I listen to like 14 podcasts or something or people I was like wow.
 But you know it's pretty cool if you do that at work.
 Unsurprisingly, the most common podcast app that we saw in responses,
 85% of people are using the iOS podcast app.
 Well, it's so pretty.
 It makes sense. It's free. It's built in.
 However, the podcast app of my personal preference and one that we've written a
 review about is an app called Overcast.
 But I don't have a overcast.
 Well, I have a bone to pick with you, sir.
 What's that? Well, you often find apps and things like that.
 that you think work better.
 And the first time I hear about them
 are on the stinking podcast.
 As opposed to you going, babe, I found this.
 This is gonna make your life easier.
 Let me put it on your phone.
 Try that.
 Just say it.
 Babe, I found this.
 This is gonna make your life easier.
 Let me put it on your phone.
  </li><li>Let me give you an example of why I don't do that anymore.
  </li><li>No, no, no, that's not what I wanna hear.
  </li><li>Okay.
 (laughing)
 Okay, so this morning in church,
 you lean over and you see me typing
 and you're like, you're looking chryssical
 I'm like, let me install this new keyboard on your phone.
 You're like, no, I don't want it.
 So usually I didn't look quizzically at the keyboard.
 I've seen it a couple of times.
 I'm not intrigued.
 I don't want to drag my phone all over the screen.
 I don't want your Google keyboard.
 OK, but I do want overcast if it's a better podcast.
 OK, but let's let's the time we're not talking about podcasts and we were talking
 about keyboards.
 And tonight I said, guys, there's a new keyboard that you'd absolutely love.
 It's from Google.
 It allows you to swipe rather than type, allows you to do keyword searching,
 It allows you to look up data straight from your keyboard
 that has a switch at.
  </li><li>It does?
  </li><li>And allows you to put in gifts.
 You'd be like, why aren't you talking about that?
 But I try to tell you about it this morning,
 you're like, and I want that.
 So what you've trained me to do.
  </li><li>You didn't tell me to do that.
 All you did was just do a slidey finger thing.
 And I was like, I can lift my finger.
 I like to use the extra muscle.
  </li><li>I got cut off at the pass.
 So historically.
  </li><li>That is not historically, that is one instance.
 The rest of them are all, I don't find it about until later.
 You know what I'm doing right now?
 I'm calling my lawyer to just,
 because love keeps the record of wrongs,
 I haven't written all the times I've been wrong.
  </li><li>But your lawyers kept track of it for you.
  </li><li>Also think about how many apps I go through
 on a daily basis.
  </li><li>Right, so that's why I don't wanna hear about all of them.
 I just wanna hear about the good ones,
 but I wanna hear about them before we podcast about them.
 I wanna be able to go, "Yeah, I love overcast."
  </li><li>Okay, babe, let me show you overcast.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Okay, what do you think of overcast?
 (laughs)
 Fantastic.
 Okay.
 In a nutshell, and by the way, I've written an article.
 You could go read the article on our website if you wanted to.
 Thanks, darling.
 Only I slept next to you.
 Okay.
 So overcast, go download.
 It's for iPhone.
 You download it from the app store.
 It's completely free.
 Here's why.
 Now, can I come off of an airplane mode while we're podcasting and download overcast?
 No, because then we'll hear that in case somebody tries to text you.
 But anyway, the things I love about Overcast, there's many of them.
 But the two things I love is it's built by a podcaster.
 So Mark Orman runs a podcast I listen to every week called Accidental Tech Podcast.
 It's a super nerd.
 Oh, that's why you like it.
 Well, that's why I like that podcast.
 So it makes sense that you would like an app written by the same guy who's
 fanatical about details. Anyway, we've spent a long detour talking about podcast in our marriage.
 Sorry, welcome. Go download Overcast and see for yourself why I like it or go to our website.
 I'll put a link in the show notes of this episode where you can read our review to decide whether
 you want to, but let's face it, it's free. So why wouldn't you want to try it? It's a podcast that
 I love. What's the stitcher? Okay, hang on. Currently, 11% of you are using Overcast. So
 So you're already in the know of why it's good.
 I'd love it.
 Well, 11 of you are in the know.
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong>
 Another 89 of us are like, well, I don't know.
 My spouse didn't tell me what overcast.
 You're particularly feisty tonight, baby.
 I'm so sorry.
 I'm loving it.
 Stick share.
 Go ahead.
 Stick share is a well-known podcast app
 for Android platforms.
 So people who use Android, they don't have access to the iOS app and they
 don't have access to overcast.
 That's so sad.
 We should probably pray for a moment.
 Okay.
 Either.
 Well, let's, let's not need to be platform racist.
 Okay.
 I'm sorry.
 But yeah, let's pray for them.
 Here's interesting.
 When we asked, do you listen to other podcasts?
 I was surprised by this.
 Well, I wasn't surprised by the fact that nearly 80% of people said, yeah,
 I do listen to other podcasts because I listened to other.
 Do you listen to other?
 Do you listen to any podcast, A.J. Jones?
 No.
 That isn't true.
 I listened to Lyle and Allison's podcast.
 I've listened to, I can't remember the name of the other podcast that I've listened to.
 That was someone who just walked in her house.
 That was Cindy.
 How do you know that?
 I can sense her.
 OK, she Canadian too.
 She's singing the national anthem.
 As she walked in the door, baby.
 But what's interesting is 21% of our listeners don't listen to another podcast.
 Yeah.
 So I feel really privileged that you choose to listen to ours.
 Yeah, thanks.
 That's awesome.
 But there's a wealth of great podcasts out there.
 Yeah.
 I, I don't usually have time to listen.
 When do you listen to podcast?
 Well, babe, it's not that I stop what I'm doing and then sit silent.
 Listen to a podcast.
 Oh, hang on a second.
 OK, go ahead.
 Don't finish that statement because this is going to be amazing.
 Keep coming.
 Yeah, heavy with it.
 You don't stop what you're doing and listen to a podcast.
 You do what?
 I listen to it while I'm in the car.
 Oh, while I'm working or I'm cleaning.
 Well, I have a question.
 Yeah.
 Why have you been maintaining a lie for the last 11 years that you can't multitask then?
 Because clearly, if you can listen to a podcast and do something else like working,
 you can actually multitask in which case I want to see you up your game at home.
 Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know what's happened to my wife.
 She might be raptured and being replaced with an alien replica.
 Who are you and what have you done with my wife?
 You embossed her.
 I am your wife.
 Where's the mild mannered me, KJ Jones, we know and love?
 I killed her.
 Good lord, this podcast is weird.
 All right, talk about this one.
 How did you find out about our podcast?
 So a huge number of you, 46% said a friend.
 Of course, there is the 20% that said other.
 Well, if you look in the other categories, it's things like, "Oh, I heard about it while
 listening to M&amp;A. I listened to M&amp;A livestream and I heard you talk about it there."
 Or there's one of the other ones on Instagram, on your website, I found it randomly.
 Yeah, so Instagram was 14%, and our website was 13%.
 So, I guess as people that just visit our website don't know we have a podcast.
 But what I love is almost half of you are listening because somebody else told you about
 That's awesome.
 So thank you to people who have spread the word and welcome people who've just joined
 us.
 In terms of people who've just joined us, we asked how often would you say you listened
 to our podcast?
 5% of you have just started.
 So welcome to the family.
 Congratulations.
 AJ is not normally this feisty.
 It's hard to say really.
 I'm just a week today.
 I'm a little scared to be honest.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 Yeah.
 I'm in a room on my own with a feisty woman.
 Do you want me to get your stuffed animal or something and help them, J?
 Oh, good Lord.
 What are you drinking right now?
 That could be the secret to the problem.
 Tea.
 We are.
 We got a boatload of delicious tea.
 So much nice tea.
 I'm right now I'm drinking a white peach tea and it's delicious.
 It's fantastic.
 Yes, the tea blessing came to our house this week.
 And I don't actually, I mean, I've never really been a I love tea.
 I'm just starting to get into it, but I can totally see why people get into tea.
 Absolutely.
 good. Maybe I should just fire random questions that you
 will hear in this. Yeah, random mode. Go for it. Favorite color. Blue.
 Favorite part of my anatomy? Ears. I'm done with your stupid
 questions. All right. 85% of people who responded to this
 podcast say that they listen every single week. Wow. I know.
 Thank you. That's awesome. Super. Thank you. That's amazing. 10%
 of you listen every now. Thank you. I'm hoping I can move from segment to segment seamlessly
 without being attacked. When we ask the people who listen every week, whether they listen
 every week or whether they have a problem and have listened to every single episode,
 including going backwards and repeating them, 44%, almost half of the people who listen
 every week say, I've actually listened to every episode. I have a problem. I've gone
 back in. And that was fun because I got to ask a second question was, well, which are
 the episodes you really loved, what are the ones that stand out and that was a real treat
 to wade through all that data too.
 Wow.
 So cool.
 Do you want to do the one about what do you like about the podcast?
 So it's honestly, it's a little weird.
 Here's why it's weird.
 And I know we've been doing it for two years, so it should be less weird.
 But what's weird about it is every Sunday evening, we come into our spare room, which
 we've now converted into a studio, purpose-built studio for podcasting.
 And we speak into microphones, we sit at either end of a table, we look at each other, we
 smile, we talk into a microphone, we have no idea if it will make sense, we have no
 idea if people will like it.
 We've got some statistics to say that yeah, probably people do, but for us it's mild
 rambling and then we do, every year we do feedback like this and you guys write lovely
 things.
 I'm a high words of affirmation person anyway, so I love hearing feedback of all kinds,
 especially positive feedback.
 But it's really helpful because normally in a conversation, if you're talking to somebody
 at the other end of the table, you can tell if they're bored or if they're interested
 or if they want to change topics.
 Here it's just you're speaking out into the ether and hoping it makes sense and it's
 benefiting somebody.
 So when we get iTunes reviews or when people shoot us an email or when people reach out
 on Twitter or Facebook saying, "Hey, I really love this episode," or we look at our stats
 and see thousands of people who listen to an episode.
 It kind of freaks us out because we don't really know what we're doing or why thousands
 of people listen.
 Right.
 So then we ask a question like, "Hey, what do you like about the podcast?"
 And pretty much you like hearing our points of view.
 Hey, George, what's your point of view?
 Some cats.
 Hate them.
 Great.
 I hope that--
 Horrible creatures.
 I hope that benefit 87% of you.
 Your sense of humor, which apparently is up to 11 this episode.
 personalities. That's nice. You have plenty of personality. I have a lovely personality for
 radio. The feel of the show and then your week. Let me talk about our week because
 one of the things I'm a little self-conscious about is when we started, we had three sections
 of the podcast, which we still do. We start with a kind of how was our week where literally we
 sit down and we look back on our counter and go, what do we do? And some weeks, our weeks are
 more interesting because we do interesting things or we have interesting speakers or we go somewhere
 new. But most weeks we're pretty much in meetings. So it's like, how was your week?
 How was great? What did you do? We had meetings, which isn't that interesting to talk about.
 And so the things that we are interested in are Apple products and food. One of the people
 who left feedback was like, it seems like your podcast tends to focus on the restaurants you eat
 at an Apple products. And I'm like, yes. Yeah. Yeah. It's in the jingle at the beginning.
 That would be the accurate.
 Well done.
 You're picking up correctly.
 But we're also aware that some of our audience don't live in Nashville in Franklin.
 And it could be really tedious to hear about the restaurants we're eating at
 all the fat to age you went to a doctor.
 So that's a bit where you're like, are you?
 Does this make sense?
 Does this not?
 And I'll tell you why we keep including it.
 Is because of the podcast that I listened to.
 And I primarily listen to it, not because I want to hear about whether
 people went to a doctor or what sort of restaurants they went. I want to hear about the areas that
 there are experts in, which is usually technology. I love listening to that, but you build up this
 relationship with people that you are listening to every single week that you've never met. So
 there's a couple of podcasts I listen to. There's four people that I'm listening to every single
 week. I have never met them. They live in different parts of America. And yeah, I know their wives'
 names. I know their children. I know what they do for a living. I know what kind of cars they drive.
 I know their preferences. And so you build up this intimate knowledge of these people.
 You know their sense of humor. You're waiting for the other co-host to make some ridiculous
 snarky remark. What do you mean by that? And, and I, as much as I love hearing them talk
 about what they think the new version of Mac OS 10 is going to have or what new debugger
 they're working on, what new software they're developing, I actually really love hearing
 the little behind the scenes. So that's why it's there. 52% of you are saying, "Yeah,
 we actually like that part." But that means there's another half of you that are like,
 "Eh, I don't really care. And I totally get that." So in the back of my head, what
 we're trying to do is not remove that, but maybe not have as prominent a feature about
 our week unless something amazing happens that is noteworthy.
 Okay.
 Does that make sense?
 Yeah, it makes sense.
 Yeah. All right. But nevertheless, it's still fun looking at this nice, pretty chart
 in candy colors that tells me you did a lovely job on the pretty candy color chart.
 Thanks babe, where did that information? I love it.
 So the next question on the thing was, what would you change about the podcast?
 And shockingly and sweetly, 65% of you said nothing. You don't want us to change a single thing.
 That's so lovely. That's very nice. It is. And also lovely is the 29% of you that said,
 make it longer.
 Which interestingly, I, so if you said make it longer, we then asked you another question that said,
 "Oh, well, how long would you like it to be?"
 I averaged out all the answers that people gave and the average length was 55 minutes.
 Good heavens.
 So here's what we're promising you.
 We're not going to speak and make it 55 minutes.
 We're, we are quite self-conscious.
 Like when we're recording, we are keeping an eye on the clock and we do want to kind of keep it around about 30 minutes.
 But sometimes, when we have Gary and Sarah or one of the guests on, I don't mind going longer
 because there's content. Sometimes when we're talking, there's a lot of content. But sometimes,
 especially towards the tail end of the school year, this year, we're getting to the podcast
 studio about 7 or 8 p.m. We're recording. It takes me a couple hours to edit it, to upload it,
 to do the artwork. So I'm aware that I'm not getting to bed till 12, 30 or 1 o'clock.
 So we have been deliberately keeping on the short side just for sanity sake.
 However, I don't want to make it a certain length for a certain length sake,
 but it is nice hearing that people would like it to be a little bit longer if it
 if it needs to be.
 So we're aiming to not be constrained by the 30 minutes,
 but by no means are we just going to fill this up with rambling about
 overcast apps and whether it's cats or not, we wouldn't be that on
 professional. One of the things that we were interested in is understanding our audience,
 because again, we don't really know who we're speaking to. We can guess, but that's not very
 helpful. One of the reasons we love doing this is we ask for a bunch of demographic information,
 you know, where do you live, how old are you? Are you married? Do you have kids, that sort of stuff.
 And then we ask some psychographic questions, like what are your aspirations, what are your
 challenges, what are the things that you're most proud of in the last 12 months, because that
 That really helps us understand who we're listening to so we can serve you better because it's
 fun coming up with topics each week, but sometimes we're like, "Uh, have we talked about this
 enough?
 Have we talked about this too little?
 Should we talk about it more?
 Are people interested in this?"
 So, it was a lot of fun.
 The difficulty is it's not very easy for us to summarize, but rest assured, we read every
 single bit of feedback.
 One of the things I wanted to highlight is how this is a bad example.
 But you know how evangelists are constantly trying to get people out of the church to
 get to the loss rather than hoping that the loss just magically show up at church and
 hear a gospel message?
 Right.
 Well, I feel like that about social media.
 There's social media that I favor and I would like everyone to be on the social media I
 like.
 Right.
 But based on this, it seems like everybody's in a place I don't want to go.
 Which is?
 Facebook.
 Yes.
 We need to go to where our audiences and ninety seven percent of you are on facebook.
 The problem with that is facebook is a cesspit of negativity and bad advertising.
 And it uses weird algorithms i would just like everything in my timeline to be chronological yeah i would do but there's no way to make that happen well i think they've even messed with instagram now.
 They have mass with instagram too but i like instagram i love being on instagram i do i really enjoy it.
 but i realize that we need to be more on facebook than we currently are because that's where our audiences
 or we could persuade them to move to instagram and twitter you like instagram you want to be instagram is great instagram is your friend you look great on instagram.
 Yeah i kind of avoid facebook like the plague unsurprisingly nobody's on linked in google plus i don't even know why i listed them i think it was just for a a turtle it looks it looks cute.
 It does it has a little bit of color to that spectrum it really does look they have snapchat yeah i thought i can snapchat you are on snapchat this week but i'm not really sure that i understand how it works.
 I try to get on snapchat but i have a rule of thumb is if i can get my username at allen i don't use the app so i'm not okay but i might create a snapchat at allen and a j and see if we can be on it that way oh but i'm not sure what is that like with that satisfy your rule.
 of what you have to have to be on a certain.
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause we've got @Allyn,
 or I've got @Allyn on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
 basically everything I use,
 but I've also got @Allyn on AJ.
 And at this point, I'd like to just give a massive shout out
 to my parents for spelling my name with a Welsh vowel,
 why that apparently nobody else has,
 which makes my life much easier.
  </li><li>It is most excellent.
  </li><li>You know, one of the things we said is,
 how could we make our podcast better for you?
 And some of you, of course, were like,
 "Nah, nothing is perfect the way it is."
 But some of you chose to click on "Other."
 And I love some of the answers.
 I'm gonna read them out.
 One answer was, "I love direct/blunt answers
 to listeners' questions.
 No pussy feuding about its brawl."
  </li><li>That's awesome.
  </li><li>That's kind of how AJ rolls.
 I'm more delicate.
  </li><li>Can we tell if that person was Scottish or not?
  </li><li>I have no idea.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>You might be able to, if we look at the date in,
 but I can't correlate it right now.
 I'm just wondering.
 I don't think a Tennessee person would necessarily answer like that, but that's not actually
 entirely true.
 How about periodic blurbs from your kiddos?
 They sounded so freaking cute.
 Yeah, they are so stinking cute.
 One of the other answers I loved was more practical teaching, talking about how to balance
 ministry and family.
 Once we figured that out, we will do more practical teaching on that.
 More life hacks.
 I loved that episode.
 It was a very good episode.
 Yeah.
 breakfast was some of this week and they were saying, "Teach us some life hacks."
  </li><li>Rogers and Jane Heather. - That's right.
  </li><li>Yeah. - And so we gave them off the top of our head,
 the best ones we had.
 Is it getting lazy that in conversation, I'm now thinking,
 have a podcast on that. Here's the URL, go listen to it.
  </li><li>Yes. - I'm outsourcing the need to
 converse with people. - We still have to relate to people.
 Yeah, that's kind of the deal.
  </li><li>Slightly fewer chronit references unless you start to export.
 I think we need to do a welcome to Franklin kit.
 So if people come to Franklin, there's a kit that they can just get off our website that maybe has a map to all the places they need to go to and what to order each place that we tell them to go to.
 I think that would be very clever.
 Right.
 I'll get on it.
 Okay.
 Because I've got nothing else to do.
 You've got nothing to do.
 You're sitting around.
 Well, this is an interesting one.
 It says, why not try writing little plays and acting them out sort of like a radio theater thing.
 Just an idea I had could be funny.
 Yeah, well you're a drama major so you probably love that I would but you could just do a
 soliloquy and I'll sit staring you with judgmental eyes.
 Oh, that sounds great.
 I think I'll pass.
 Okay.
 Somebody said interview Jeff dollar.
 We absolutely need to have Jeff and Becky back on because we have interviewed Jeff but we
 have an interview Jeff and Becky.
 Babe, how awesome would that be?
 The two of them.
 That would be fantastic.
 Let's get on it.
 We need to do that.
 Can I mention that our microphones are both missing?
 Well that's because I've shipped them away for a top secret project.
 Okay, but we'll get them back and then we'll have some other you guys were great at telling us guests that you would like us to have on will do our best at booking all them.
 I'm sure president Obama should be ready soon enough to be done being president soon and then I'm sure the first thing you want to do is come on our podcast.
 Oh, I'm sure.
 Is there anything you really don't like about the podcast this one's cute this feels incredibly selfish but feeling let down by a short episode.
 Sorry that's terrible.
 Love looking forward to hear you guys each week super encouraging makes me jealous to experience more of all awesome stuff you chat about which can only be good thing i totally get that there have been a few episodes where we are.
 Dead tired and i'm looking at the clock thinking i know that soon as we finish recording this i need to edit this i need to get up and so i get i there's podcast i love listen to the i feel.
 a short changed when it's maybe shorter than necessary so we'll try to avoid that.
 Well, one of the people said just the extremely long jingle at the end.
 It is clever though.
 It is very clever and it has a special place in my heart.
 It does.
 The reason we did put it at the end was it is extremely long.
 And once you hear it, you know that the episode is over.
 Let me tell you are thinking behind the jingles.
 Often when I'm on a long road trip and I'm listening to podcasts and I'm listening to,
 For example, podcast on overcast, it will just play episode to episode to episode.
 Sometimes, it's hard for me to know, wait, is this still the same episode or have they switched it?
 So, we top and tailor episodes, the first one's got a less than 10 second jingle from Jesse early.
 Then, we finish with a slightly longer jingle at the end, understanding if you don't like the jingle,
 you know that the episode is over, there's nothing else, there's no post show.
  </li><li>But we could start doing that. - Oh, no, we're not going to do that.
 Like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, if you wait until the end,
 then there's like-- - Baby, my affection.
  </li><li>Just grew stronger for you. - Thank you.
  </li><li>You called it the Marvel Cinematic Universe
 and not a butchering of that.
  </li><li>Thank you.
 And then we could do like a little like hidden snippet
 for those that listen to the end.
  </li><li>Well, we're not going to do that.
 But the reason that we have that extremely long jingle
 at the end, so you know that it's over.
 If you like the song, which I love,
 and I sing it all the time,
 but if you don't like it, stop it.
 There's no need to listen through it.
 How about this, babe?
 Are there any topics we haven't talked about yet that you'd love us to cover for you?
 Um, well, a couple of them are things like, um, money and wealth creation.
 Okay.
 Uh, probably good to have some of our friends on to talk about that.
 Yeah.
 Who are really good at generating wealth.
 Yes.
 As opposed to us.
 Yeah.
 Um, how about it might be fun to hear about a favorite list.
 If you guys are the types that hate lists, I'm sorry.
 I love lists.
 I love lists too.
 Dude, I love lists.
 List are my friend.
 You just call somebody dude.
 Well, dude or doodette.
 OK, so it says like a J top three kitchen gadgets.
 I need more than three to talk to you about that.
 But you wouldn't want to live without.
 We actually have a little project up or sleeve that hits right on that
 favorite thing, which we'll talk about probably after the summer.
 But I love that favorite list idea.
 What about LGBTQ? What is that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and mental illness are both
 interesting, controversial topics that they are that would be good to hear your views on?
 We have noticeably, by its absence, steered clear of that topic. Not because we don't have opinions,
 and not because we don't have teachings on it, but I've just found it is such a delicate topic that
 is so worthy of attention. Absolutely is. But the thought of opening that can in a 30 to 45
 minute show is I feel I would be reckless on that because the danger is you're no matter where you
 land on your opinions on that, you're going to end up hearing us through that filter and you're
 going to hear sound bites. And honestly, one of the things I've been praying to the Lord about for
 a couple of years now is Lord, how can we communicate biblical truth to the gay community and to the
 Christian community that is actually going to be helpful and not empty rhetoric or
 or not inflammatory rhetoric? And I don't have an answer for that yet. We do have some teaching on
 that in our sexual purity, which might help, but it's something that we talk about a fair amount,
 either with people who are facing same-sex attraction or people who want to talk theoretically.
 I try to avoid talking about theoretically because it feels a little distasteful to talk
 theoretically about things that are so pertinent to many people's lives. So out of respect for
 that whole topic and out of respect, we've deliberately not talked about that because we find the
 the constraints of the podcast too difficult to do that.
 So I would love to talk about it.
 I'm not sure how to solve that problem.
 Any ideas, Ajit Jones?
  </li><li>I don't think it would be wise to talk about it
 in this format, just because you don't actually know
 who your audience is.
 You can't administer to them.
 I don't want to open up something
 and then leave people floating out there.
  </li><li>And one of the things I love when we teach
 is being able to do question and answer.
 Because actually that clarifies misunderstandings.
 I'd probably prefer to talk about it
 more than I would write about it,
 but then again, maybe I wouldn't
 because in writing you can be more deliberate.
 And anyway, that's something we're thinking about,
 something we're praying about,
 something that we're not shying away talking about
 because we don't have our views on it,
 we're shying away from it
 because we don't know how best to communicate our views
 while being super inclusive and by inclusive,
 I mean, making sure our hearts come across appropriately.
 I don't even know if that makes sense.
 How about parenting, babe?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Or more about heaven?
  </li><li>Yeah, I saw that.
 Father heart, more about the father heart, or culture shock.
  </li><li>Our spiritual gifts.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Which leads us neatly into the last part of the show,
 which is listeners' questions.
 One of the overwhelming pieces of feedback that we got
 was please, please, please don't skip listeners' questions.
 So we're purposing in our heart not to skip listeners questions.
 We have a backlog of listeners questions to go through, but we love getting your questions.
 We queue them up.
 If you do have questions for us, send them into us go to allenagio.com/ask and we'll
 get your question.
 This week's question comes from Katie and she says, "Hi, I love your podcast.
 It has been very encouraging.
 My question is, I have been told that I have the seer gift in prophecy and I've been briefly
 told what that is.
 I was wondering if you two could give me more of an in-depth answer that explains the other
 types of prophetic gifts.
 Thanks.
 Brilliant question, Katie.
 I just realized I love talking about the prophetic.
 Yeah, it's pretty fun.
 It's tremendous.
 Katie, I'm going to start and A.G. jump in and interrupt me any time you want.
 I'm going to start by answering your question slightly differently from the way you asked
 it and then you'll see why in a second.
 Let's forget about prophecy for a second and let's talk about revelatory gifts.
 If you read 1 Corinthians 12, it talks a lot about spiritual gifts and you, Paul writes
 a bunch about the different gifts.
 But I want you to imagine I had an umbrella and that umbrella would be revelatory gifts.
 That's kind of banner.
 That's the topics that we're talking about here.
 And underneath that umbrella would be the different gifts that fit into the category of
 revelatory gifts. So in no particular order, you see Paul mentioned in this passage,
 the gift of prophecy, the gift of the word of knowledge, the gift of the word of wisdom,
 the gift of discernment, the gift of interpretation of tongues. The things they all have in common
 is they are all revelatory gifts. By revelatory, I mean, it takes supernatural understanding to
 communicate those gifts.
 Yes.
 So let's let's go through what we mean by those.
 So when we talk about gift of prophecy, I'm going to be fairly narrow in my definition of this.
 I would say the gift of prophecy here is foretelling as opposed to fourth telling, which we'll go into in a second.
 So foretelling is when you're prophesying, you're speaking things that are yet to happen.
 You're you're by the Holy Spirit.
 He's taking from what's known in heaven.
 He's making it known to you and you're declaring or you're speaking out what the Holy Spirit is showing.
 you about the future.
 And regardless of how that revelation actually comes to you, so whether it comes by hearing
 or by seeing or feeling or knowing or whatever, all of those things can still lead to foretelling.
 Right.
 So, gift of prophecy would be foretellings, telling something about the future.
 Then there's a gift of the word of knowledge, which I would describe fairly narrowly as
 "forthtelling."
 So a word of knowledge is something that you know that you have no way of knowing in the
 natural either about a present situation or the past.
 So a gift of prophecy looks forward, the gift of the word of knowledge looks present
 day or past.
 Give you some examples.
 So some words of knowledge would be about, would be you knowing someone else's thoughts
 by the Holy Spirit.
 When we've had prophetic ministers who've called out people by their name or their pen
 number or their date of birth, that's things they've known or people knowing things about
 your past.
 That's not a gift of prophecy.
 It's a gift of word of knowledge.
 Now, honestly, sometimes they're all used interchangeably.
 I'm splitting hairs just to be precise here.
 Well, I mean, I think often people that we've had on the podcast like Gary or whatever will
 get words of knowledge that helps identify the person.
 And that person knows it's them because it's their birthday.
 their name. It's their thing that nobody knows about them. It's their whatever. And then from
 there, they go into prophecy or foretelling, which is the encouragement to keep pressing forward
 for what God has for them. So those things, those two pair very, very well.
 They do.
 And I've seen God often do things from the past to tell somebody, "Hey, I know you
 so that they're paying attention for going forward."
 And people would use the term, oh, that's a prophetic gift.
 I like to say that's a revelatory gift.
 I honestly don't split hairs in conversation, but just for the purpose of this,
 we're talking about revelatory gifts, prophecy being one of them.
 The third one we talked about was a gift of the word of wisdom.
 Wisdom isn't good advice.
 Wisdom is supernatural self that can be applied to a situation or a problem
 that contains solutions from heaven to problems on earth.
 And I've come to fall in love with a gift of wisdom.
 I've made a point to seek out wisdom from people in our lives.
 And I love it.
 I love, and we've been on the receiving end where people would come to us with
 questions that's so above our pay grade, but the Holy Spirit will give us wisdom
 for them that wasn't from us.
 Yeah.
 It was beyond our years.
 You're like, Oh, wow, that wasn't me at all.
 But again, that's a revelatory gift.
 Instead of telling us about the future, God's telling us about a plan that will help the future come to pass.
 And that's wisdom.
 Right.
 Number four, baby, something you move in a lot.
 Yeah.
 Number four is the gift of discernment or discerning of spirits.
 And, you know, people, again, they discern spirits in different ways, whether you see them, sometimes you hear them, you smell them, you feel them.
 but it is a revelatory gift in terms of you can accurately ascertain what could be going on with
 a person that they need freedom from. Yeah, our situation, discerning what spirits are
 at operation. If people coming to you with great ideas, is that the Holy Spirit, is that a deceiving
 spirit? Like what's going on there? Again, it's revelatory. You only know that because the Holy
 Holy Spirit tells you it's not drawn from your own understanding or your own study.
 Yes.
 And then the last one that Paul mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12 is the gift of interpretation
 of tongues.
 Again, it takes supernatural knowledge to know what somebody is speaking in a heavenly language
 because it doesn't make sense when people are speaking in tongues in the natural.
 Except for the rare occasions when they're actually speaking in different languages.
 Correct.
 We've seen a couple of times.
 Yeah, very cool.
 So these five different revelatory gifts, all totally different, but they do overlap and
 they are all under this banner of revelatory gifts in that the Holy Spirit is communicating
 something to you that you didn't know prior.
 So Katie, you mentioned the seer gift.
 I would prefer to talk about the seer rather than it being a gift.
 Instead I would talk about the seer as a way of receiving revelation that would work
 with any of those five gifts.
 So, for example, when I'm asking the Lord for wisdom or a word of prophecy or a word
 of knowledge, I tend to see stuff on people.
 So when I look at people, I can see in the spirit as the Lord leads me and I can see words
 written over them, I can see colors over them, I can see dates, I can see calendars over them.
 And so most of the way I hear God, so to speak, is through sight.
 So that would be kind of a more of a seer way of receiving revelation.
 Yeah. And for myself, I'm kind of 50/50. I'm half seeing half hearing. So sometimes I'm just
 hearing a dialogue from heaven. And I'm repeating that. And other times I'm seeing things. And
 sometimes it's both. So I'm seeing something and I'm having the dialogue that's interpreting what
 I'm seeing, you know, while I'm speaking.
 And then we have prophetic friends who don't see at all.
 They just, their revelation comes either through scripture, they hear verses for people,
 or they will hear the voice of the Lord speak to them and they don't see things.
 One way is not better than another, it's just propensity to the way you're wired or the way
 that your gift works.
 Yeah.
 A really helpful book to read, an excellent book is written by a friend of ours, James Goll.
 he's written a wonderful book called the seer and it goes into the role of a seer and how they're different and similar to profit.
 It's an excellent book highly recommend it one of the most interesting things i ever heard james say we're interviewing him for the second year of her school and you know james is known around the world for as a profit but he's also known around the world as an author.
 and he wrote this best-selling book called the seer and everybody assumes that he is a seer and
 while we're interviewing him he said you know Alan I never saw until I served Bob Jones and that
 shocked me so Bob Jones is now with the lord but he was a very very well-known prophet a seer but
 by definition most of Bob's revelation would come by dreams or visions so he would see a lot
 hence the term a seer. But James said, that's not the way I got revelation. I would mostly get
 revelation by feeling and by knowing. He said, you know, I would feel a lot. But as I started
 serving Bob in ministry, I began to see like Bob saw. So you can constantly grow in your gift.
 If you're more predominantly a seer, it doesn't mean that you can't hear God. You can learn to
 develop the parts of your spirit in different ways that you can hear God.
 And we love all that.
 We have a whole teaching on prophetic ministry on our website, Alanagea.com.
 If you go there, you can find a five part teaching on how to grow in the prophetic.
 And the whole teaching is aimed at people who never prophesied before.
 That might be an encouragement to you to listen.
 So just in wrapping up today, especially since we were talking about podcasts and
 all the information that came back, you know, over 50% of you are listening to us
 because a friend told you about this podcast.
 So I wanted to encourage you, tell a friend or tag a friend if you see an episode on Instagram
 or on Facebook that you think a friend would like.
 We would love to influence their lives too.
 Yeah, if your life has been changed anyway, thank you for listening and do us a favor.
 Share an episode like I just said with a friend.
 It would help them and it would help us too.
 If you want to see the statistics, head on over to the show notes at <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/103
 and you'll be able to follow along with all of the information if that's the kind of thing
 you like to do.
 Otherwise, have a wonderful week.
