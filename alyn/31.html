<p> Alison Jean Jones, how are you?<br/>
 Alma Jo.<br/>
 Ola.<br/>
 It could be one of those nights.<br/>
 You know what I want to talk about before we do anything else?
 What?<br/>
 My technology wonder upgrades this week.
 Okay.<br/>
 That should be very exciting for about 2% of the population.
 No.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 So, AT&amp;T. So for those of us who don't live in America, that you're listening to the podcast,
 basically where we live, we've got two choices of TV and internet providers, Comcast and AT&amp;T.
 We've been with both of them. What I tend to do is I sign up with one for 12 months. If you usually
 sign up as a new customer, they'll give you ridiculous pricing. Then when my 12 month contract
 is up, I call and disconnect from them and sign up with the other one to get the new customer
 pricing and they love us for it.<br/>
 And I go back and forward while they don't care.
 They just want our business.<br/>
 So being with AT&amp;T and they gave us such a ridiculous deal last year,
 they gave us 450 channels of which we probably watched five and they gave us
 internet.<br/>
 And so I called them up this week and just said, Hey, you know, thank you so
 much. You've been great, but we realized we don't actually watch TV.
 So we want to cancel our TV and just stick with our internet.
 And the very fact that we were canceling our TV meant we got put through to a retention specialist
 whose job is to make sure we don't leave the company.
 Well, I had no plan on leaving the company at all.
 But after talking to this very helpful woman, she decided to double our internet
 speed for almost half the price of what we were paying.
 And so, and technician came out on Thursday and we now have fiber optic to the
 to the house.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Which is great.<br/>
 And we have dedicated 50 megabits, which isn't a lot.
 Well, I guess it is a lot, but it isn't as much as it will be.
 Right now, I can hear as my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,
 Right now, I can hear his momma, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, fast, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
 All I'd to say is AT&amp;T is Picnacial to be one of the next cities that they're bringing
 gigabit ethernet, it's a thousand megabits per second.
 Our technician said, "Well, you're good to go when it comes."
 So I was really excited about that.<br/>
 And a gigabit is how much I download it in a month.
 Sure.<br/>
 A gigabyte.<br/>
 Is that the same thing as a gigabit?<br/>
 No.<br/>
 But I digress.
</p><ul>
  <li>Okay, one of the bytes.
  </li><li>T-Mobile, we switched from AT&amp;T to T-Mobile.
 Being with T-Mobile is like having Christmas every month.
 The first month we signed up with them,
 they gave us new iPhone 6s.
  </li><li>They did.
  </li><li>And bought us out of our contract from AT&amp;T.
  </li><li>That's the deal, yeah.
  </li><li>The very next month, they gave us a free wifi router,
 which is fast on the router that we had.
 I don't know, a couple hundred dollars router
 that sent us for free.
 This month, they announced that they're doing
 unlimited LTE family plan for a hundred bucks a month.
  </li><li>Amazing.
  </li><li>So why do I feel like you're just humoring me?
 (laughing)
  </li><li>No, that's amazing.
 And I even understand what you're talking about
 at this point.
  </li><li>Well, so before I go over our bandwidth allocation
 every month, we kind of have five gig per line
 and I always go over it.
 So now that we're having--
  </li><li>That's not true, apparently my line only has three gig
 and yours has five.
  </li><li>Right. And why is that?
 I have no idea because you don't even use a gigabyte a month.
 It doesn't matter.
 You want everything to be equal.
 Maybe I'll call the gils for the mega-measure.
 Anyway, all of that being said, I had a great week technologically and we now have unlimited
 LTE, which is great because I've burned through our data like nobody else's business.
 Talk to us about something more interesting.
 Talk to us about baptisms.
 We did a whole bunch of baptisms on Monday night.
 So I spoke on Romans 6 and we had announced like two weeks before that we were going to
 do baptisms at the end of speaking.
 So basically, Romans 6 is all about what happens during baptism.
 And I felt like the Lord said to get extra clothes ready in extra towels.
 And so sweet Michelle went and got extra dark shirts and extra swim shorts
 from Walmart.
 She got asked for 10 sets and eight extra people got baptized.
 Which was a lot of fun.
 Yeah.
 So we did, I think we baptized 18 people.
 And it was super fun.
 I loved baptisms.
 Yeah, it was great.
 It was really, really great.
 Such a privilege to do it.
 It was so fun.
  </li><li>And then our son was caught break dancing.
  </li><li>Yeah, that was Tuesday.
 We come in from lunch break.
 We had a meeting over lunch.
 And so I asked Caroline if she could, you know,
 have a lunch date with MJ at the school.
 And he loves being in the room with all the students
 and interacting with them.
 Anyway, we come in and the students are all
 in this big circle, not all of them,
 but like 15 or 20 of the students,
 and they're all going, "Go MJ, go MJ,"
 and they're clapping, and MJ is break dancing,
 and then doing this cute little pose,
 which I have no idea where he learned it.
  </li><li>He learned it from me.
 I'm basically electric boogaloo king.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>When no one's watching, I get a piece of linoleum out.
 I do some head spin, some windmills.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>That could explain your neck, darling.
  </li><li>Yes, let's talk about my neck.
 (laughing)
 I have a pinched nerve on the left side of my neck.
 I got X-rays done on my chiropractor's office
 and I have a little bone spur in one of my,
 I was gonna call them neck particles, what are they called?
  </li><li>Vertibray. - Vertibray.
 Which as a result is pinching a nerve,
 which means my whole left arm loses power
 and I have a pretty sore neck,
 but I'm so very grateful for our chiropractor.
  </li><li>Best chiropractor ever.
  </li><li>Wonderful doctor, Ronson, if you're in Franklin,
 look up mission on the chiropractic.
 But yeah, I've basically been having adjustments every day,
 trying to get my neck unlocked and it's truly unlocked.
  </li><li>Well, you're so much better.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I've been taking magnesium a lot,
 which is some interesting side effects.
 (both laughing)
 See, I can't tell it's between your sexy laugh
 and your creepy laugh.
 What was that one?
 That was just a giggle, I think.
 It was neither sexy nor creepy, hopefully.
  </li><li>We've been party animals.
  </li><li>We have been just--
  </li><li>All that magnesium.
  </li><li>Living at large with the magnesium.
  </li><li>Well, we had our good supernatural life,
 Christmas party.
  </li><li>We did.
  </li><li>On Thursday night.
 And then we had all this stuff over to our house tonight
 for a little swari.
 That was fun, wasn't it?
  </li><li>It was great fun, yeah.
 It's always nice to have a clean house because that forces us to clean.
 You see, you may as well as I said, people over because it forces us to clean.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 That's what I meant.
 Um, you know what?
 I'm finding my dream life is completely alive.
 I'm sorry.
 Am I boring?
 I'm sorry.
 I'm a little tired.
 No, I just realized in the last couple of weeks, the effect that my dreams are having on my everyday life.
 Like I have dreams about people and because I've had a dream about the people,
 my heart feels fully connected with those people.
 And then I go look them up or go find them or go connect with them because I had a dream.
 And then this week I had a dream about some friends I haven't seen in 10 years.
 And it was so good to be with them in the dream.
 And then when I woke up, I'd got an email from them saying, Hey, we'd love to, you know,
 reconnect what's your address.
 And I was like, God, this is amazing.
 It is amazing.
 So that's actually what I wanted to talk about this week.
 I wanted to talk about people and the joy of having people in your life.
 I watched a video.
 So some of you may know this, but I was an avid skateboarder in my youth.
 And to this day, I still keep a finger on the pulse of skateboarding.
 I visit a website called thebarrix.com.
 He has a scar in his elbow to prove it.
 I do.
 And so they were doing a video retrospective of a guy called Guy Mariana.
 So when I was a kid, Guy Mariana was one of my heroes.
 He was younger than me.
 Still is.
 It's amazing how that works.
 They never catch up, do they?
 No.
 This phenomenally gifted skateboarder.
 The first video I ever remember seeing him in was a video called, it was the blind video,
 video days.
 This amazing skateboarder, and he was skateboarding in this video with some of the legends of skateboards
 of Mark Gonzalez and Jason Lee.
 I was watching this video, and there was one a day for five days.
 And I was really, really impacted by this man now going back in time, telling the story
 of the story behind the videos that were a mainstay of my childhood.
 And I realized the common thread in all the stories he was telling were other people.
 He talked about how he was influenced by these people and how these people helped him become
 who he is.
 And I don't know why I got so moved by this video.
 And I just started thinking about all the people who have helped me be me.
 And so I was thinking, you know, I had this dream, like I said, about some friends of
 mine, who I would probably hang out with for so many years.
 I lived with one of them.
 You know, we all would hang out together.
 And so I have this dream.
 I haven't seen them in 10 years time.
 Our lives moved apart, quite literally moved to different countries.
 touched with them, but I had a dream this week that was with them and my heart was fully
 alive and I just thought, "Gosh, I just remember hanging out with these guys there were so
 amazing." So it got me thinking about here these two brothers that 10 years ago had such
 an impact on my life without them ever thinking we're now going to have an impact on Ireland's
 life. The 10 years later in a completely different country, I'm thinking back on our time spent
 with them with such fond memories.
 And it got me thinking, who am I connecting with today that in 10 years time I'll be thinking,
 man, I'm so glad I got to know so and so and so and so.
 The danger when you talk about this is inevitably we're going to leave out people because our
 whole life is one rich tapestry of other people.
 But in your life as you look back, talk to me about some of the relationships that really
 changed who you were and made you what you are now, or help contribute to that.
 Well, I suppose I mean it's different people in different seasons and if we're leaving aside like obvious ones like john and carol that we've talked about on the podcast before then.
 I mean jana my cousin jana.
 Who prayed for me every single night for like seven years until I got saved and was sort of my when I did get saved was my initial like.
 What about this you know that kind of thing and you know it's still did you like her as so before you got saved.
 When you tell your testimony she sounds like she was your arch nemesis because she was trying to drag you in the kingdom and you want nothing to do with her kingdom.
 But as cousins were you close we were close, I mean I loved her.
 I mean we're just yeah we're living in two different kingdoms and you love to her you know we will you know she when I think about it now she wasn't even remotely crazy she was just trying to tell me about the love of God but it just.
 I made me angry.
 But I mean she wasn't over the top crazy or anything like that. Just felt like that to me because I had so much anger and pain.
 But yeah, I mean I we loved
 We'd love being together for like the first day and a half and then I'd be like yeah, and I'm done
 You know but then by the time I got saved
 You know Jenna and I were like super super close for years still super close. It was amazing if you know
 It's impossible to say what I'm gonna say next, but it's plausible.
 Had she not been praying for you and had she not been in your life, you may never have been the person you are today.
 Very true.
 Yep. I mean, there's lots of people along the way to contribute to
 that scenario.
 But I just think about what a genius God is, that we all have to live life day by day,
 but he put people in our lives that make life so much richer.
 like our job, I love our job.
 I absolutely love our life.
 And a large reason that I love our job
 and I love our life is because the people
 that we get to work with and the people
 we get to do life with.
 And it's amazing, isn't it?
 What a great source of joy
 and a great source of blessing other people are.
  </li><li>Yeah, and the people that you get to work with
 and do life with right now are the product
 of other people as well.
 You know, like in terms of if you think,
 Jan is the way she is because Antiony and Uncle Paul raised her to love God and you know whatever.
 So you just think like there's, there's unsung heroes, every ring out from the people that,
 that may have touched you.
 Does that make sense?
 And I love how it happens almost accidentally.
 Like I think growing up, I, you know, hang out with my friends, Mark and Neil, I never,
 you know, I know for a fact, didn't think like, well, let's hang out and influence Alan's life.
 Nor do I think I will now influence Mark and Neil's life at all.
 But just having rich friendships does amazing things for you.
 I've just got this fresh appreciation.
 I don't know whether it's the end of the year, so you're doing a yearly retrospective.
 I don't know whether watching these videos made me think a little bit longer term.
 I don't know if it's because I'm 40 and I'm thinking in longer term things.
 week especially as so tremendously grateful for the friendships and the relationships that
 God has put in our life. And it made me think about their friendships and the relationships
 we have today and how they're going to impact all those parties in years to come.
 Yeah. I mean, I think even about our relationship with Jeff and Becky and about how our life
 in his current incarnation would not be possible without those two. I mean, leave us at the
 that they're our employers.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But just the, you know, I just think of even all the,
 no hardships, but the difficult stuff that we've navigated
 as people, friends, church leaders,
 you know, in the last couple of years since we've been here,
 just the life of helping run a church
 and just about how much joy there's been even
 in difficult stuff because of rich relationships.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And you don't get rich relationships without spending time.
 That is absolutely correct.
 I don't know.
 I don't know whether I'm just having an aha moment about obvious stuff that the rest
 of the world is like, oh, people are good.
 But for me, people be relationships.
 No, but for me, I just think it's amazing.
 I remember listening to Roland Baker preach.
 You know, we were in Japan and he was at the same conference we were.
 What do you think?
 I think his message was, what do you think revival can do for you?
 And his own message was you guys are spending all your time and energy praying and fasting
 for revival and I'd like to know why.
 And they were just saying revival won't love you, revival won't help you, revival won't
 bring you joy, revival, which was just a huge wake up call to everybody.
 And his point was rather than seek revival, seek relationships, relationship with God
 and relationship with one another.
 And I just remember that message really sticking with me.
 I think it was our last letter that they sent out, Roland and Heidi had said, "You know,
 the most important thing in the kingdom is relationships."
 Somewhere along the line, I think we can lose sight of the value and the importance of relationships.
 Maybe I did.
 I have no idea.
 But just this week especially, I've just been pondering about how amazing relationships
 are.
 I think about my relationship with Glenn.
 How long have I known Glenn?
 I don't have any idea.
 Well, 20 years.
 He got off the boat from Ireland with a sack of potatoes in,
 I must have been 20.
 So 20 years ago, just dressed head to don't denim.
 Perfect center parting.
 Wow.
 Yeah.
 We had our work out, but we, you know, just so Glenn, who's the best man
 in my wedding and I think I was the best man in his wedding.
 Yeah, I think it was.
 Um, you know, we've been friends for 20 years.
 And so even though we live on the other side of the world, I'm incredibly grateful for our relationship that has navigated itself through all different kind of seasons and time zones and countries.
 And, you know, obviously I don't get to see him anywhere near the amount that I used to when I lived in the same city as him.
 But the fact that I can still send him abusive texts and he means...
 And FaceTime him.
 And we find it amusing.
 I just think, gosh, that's amazing.
 It is amazing.
 Totally.
 All right, let's get down to what's important here.
 Mr. Jones.
 What's important?
 What do you buy me for Christmas?
 Oh, I thought this was sex related.
 Dang it.
 You know, Mark DuPont is in time.
 Yes.
 And he preached at Grace Adams.
 You can't buy me Mark DuPont for Christmas.
 No, I don't have any intention of doing that.
 Okay.
 But Mark was preaching at Grace Adams' one.
 He preached two amazing sermons.
 I'm pulling up my sermon notes of what he said.
 But one of the things that he said at the end of today, which I really, really liked,
 like. He was talking about the gifts of God, but one of the things he said, he challenged
 us at the end was he said, "Consider giving a gift to honor the call of God on somebody
 else's life." We all have a call of God on our life, but most of us wrestle with that
 call. We live to some degree and some level of unbelief about it. So he said, "Can you
 buy a present or a gift for somebody that honors the call of God that you recognize
 in their life that would help break that. I thought, "What a wonderful exercise to do."
 Yeah, very cool.
 I know it's great. I really encourage everybody to do that. But I was also wondering about if I
 could challenge our listeners to buy somebody a gift or to give somebody a gift that honors
 the friendship and the relationship that they have infused. So rather than just buying a gift
 because it's Christmas, rather than buying a gift because that's a nice thing to do,
 intentionally pick out a gift that speaks to the value of that person's friendship and relationship
 in your life. And of course, you're never going to be able to repay value. I'm just, you know,
 a gift that gives a prophetic nod to the impact that these people have had in their life.
 I mean, the greatest, hands down, the greatest gift I've ever been given is on my 30th birthday,
 on my 40th birthday, you behind my back put together a beautiful book of people writing
 notes of, "Hey Alan, this is how your life has impacted me." I mean, I treasure those books,
 they're just absolutely incredibly important to me. And so there's no mandatory value attached
 to that except for the printer paper and the time it took you to print them out and copy and
 paste them in, you relentless crafter you. But that spoke incredible value to me.
 So I'm not necessarily talking about monetary value, but I wonder if there is something you,
 Everybody who's listening could do this week where you think of somebody who's of value to you and buy that person a gift that speaks to that value.
 That's like a fun exercise that's an amazing exercise.
 Yeah.
 All right any closing thoughts.
 What do you want for Christmas.
 Well I have an Amazon wish list answers that brilliant.
 As do I but I don't know any of those gadgets do.
 You need to know what they do you need to buy them.
 All right, fine. No hints from you.
 No, no, there's no hints. There's a whole list of literal gifts that I would like.
 I don't need applying guesswork to this.
 Guesswork is the beginning of disappointment.
 Oh, dear. Well, we'll just have to see what happens.
 All right, you beautiful people. We love you. Thank you for listening.
 Next week, I think what we should do is do our best of 2014.
 What was our favorite album, favorite movie, favorite meal, that sort of stuff?
 That's a yearly recap of our favorite things.
 Okay.
 All right, no pressure.
 Well, okay.
 Until then.
 Bye.
 Why do we whisper?
 I don't know.
 Okay.
 Night night.
 Let's go have sexy cuddle time.
