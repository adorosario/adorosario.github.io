<p> Mrs. AJ Jones.<br/>
 Mr. Alan Jones.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 I'm good.<br/>
 I still feel like I'm recovering from being cold and wet all day.
 Is that because you were cold and wet all day?
 Yes.<br/>
 Well, once my hair is wet, it takes hours to dry and we ended up getting wet today.
 We got wet today because we were out in the rain.
 And?<br/>
 We both got dunked in the dunk tank.<br/>
 Yeah, that people paid to dunk their pastors. I think there's something wrong with that.
 It was a little traumatic. Was it? Well, no, traumatic is too strong a word, but it was a little
 intense sitting just waiting, not knowing if you're going to. And sometimes it would hit their
 kaklunk, but it wouldn't go down. Yes. And so your body would react as if you had been dropped into
 the water. Yes. And you were like one of the first people up. So people were very excited about
 thinking either is like a lineup or or they just want to dunk me yeah but I'm I'm gonna go with the nicer notion
 I'm gonna go with the nicer notion that
 It was because you were near the beginning it was a novelty factor. Yes. Okay. Let's go with that
 We've had a pretty busy weekish. I still feel out of the loop since the more conference
 I do too because of course we had Memorial Day on Monday which is like a Monday off for those of
 who are not American so British people think of a bank holiday Monday which I think it was for
 you guys as well but we had a bunch of people over for a last minute kind of barbecue thing
 that we sorted out. Yeah we sort of do the thing of oh it's our first Memorial Day Monday where we
 don't have a conference. What do people do on Memorial Day? Yeah because we used to run the
 the more comfort son. Memorial day. Memorial day. Yeah. So we decided to have an impromptu barbecue,
 which was really fun. It was. It was a lot of fun. Yeah. That's what we've done. We've had
 tons of people contact all week. Yes. Because we did a wedding this weekend,
 Allie and Parks wedding. Yes. Which I think we should comment was catered by Chick-fil-A,
 which was sheer genius. It was sheer genius. But there was lots that was sheer genius about that
 wedding. Like the Yoda cake? Yeah. Well, that wasn't for the wedding. That was for the rehearsal
 but yes, there was a Yoda cake and the well coffee house did like a whole, you know, while
 they're off getting their pictures because they didn't do the first look thing. We were
 there. Everybody was there when they saw each other for the first time, which was awesome because
 he bawled. And then in between time while we're waiting for the food, the well coffee house was
 there making a using coffee. Like they had like a portable espresso machine and everything.
 Which yes, it was great comments on the coffee.
 They don't want coffee, but they had a popcorn machine too.
 So that kept me happy, which is great.
 Cause you think like a lot of weddings you, you serve like fancy or, or
 doves and stuff, but half the time you can't tell what it is.
 Everybody likes popcorn.<br/>
 Yeah, who doesn't like popcorn?<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 Seriously.<br/>
 Perfect.<br/>
 Who are you?<br/>
 I mean, even the dog like the popcorn.
 I'm just kidding.<br/>
 So anyway, it was, yeah, it was great.
 But you know, Chick-fil-A, if, if you haven't tasted Chick-fil-A, it is
 fast food, but I actually dug out a video of one of our first times ever eating Chick-fil-A.
 And this was years ago when we actually had a video podcast.
 I should see if I can find all of them and post them on our site just for a laugh.
 They're so old.<br/>
 They're so old.<br/>
 But think how much thinner and younger we look.
 Yeah, let's post them.<br/>
 But Chick-fil-A is just absolutely delicious.
 And if we were to get married again, I'd want Chick-fil-A to cater our wedding.
 What?<br/>
 But I'm looking at your face and thinking, "Good job, we're getting married again.
 Let's move on."<br/>
 Good job, we're not.<br/>
 I have a piece of follow-up from last week.
 Okay.<br/>
 Last week, I quipped that we went on our annual walk round Radder Lake, and you seem slightly
 taken aback that I referred to as our annual walk, correct?
 Well, I thought we went more than once.
 But unchecking our show notes.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 I posted this year's annual walk round Radder Lake on May 25th.
 The last time we walked around it was June 2nd.
 So within a week of a year.<br/>
 But did we not go twice last year?<br/>
 Oh, I took Abby another time.<br/>
 See, if I don't go, it doesn't happen.
 Right.<br/>
 Yeah, if you don't go what part of it doesn't happen, they're complaining about
 the bugs in nature, which I think tea has picked up on my disgust of the outdoors.
 It's kind of hard not to pick up on your disgust of the outdoors.
 I was very brave this week.<br/>
 I did an outdoor wedding and I was at our church family picnic.
 You were so brave.<br/>
 And I didn't complain at all.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And all those lions and tigers and wild animals that were there.
 I mean, yes.<br/>
 Our subtopic before we get to our main topic this week, I wanted to talk a little bit
 about the podcast feedback.<br/>
 You guys were amazing.<br/>
 If you remember, or if you just tuned in and you don't know what we're talking
 about about two weeks ago, we put up a survey asking for a whole bunch of feedback.
 And you guys filled it out and it was amazing.
 It was astonishing, wasn't it babe?
</p><ul>
  <li>It really was.
 It was super encouraging because I think I alluded
 to this before, the podcasting is kind of a one-sided
 adventure, like A.J. and I are sat in our pajamas,
 we're upstairs in our spare room,
 we're looking at each other and recording this thing.
 It's gonna be posted on Monday.
 And sure of emails that you guys send in or tweets
 or comments on iTunes or whatever,
 we up until last week didn't really know
 or if you enjoyed this.
 And it was amazing, you know, about 100 of you
 took the time to give us feedback.
 So I'm not sure we can take that as a representative sample,
 nodding back to my statistical analysis day in university.
 But nevertheless, it was 100 more pieces of information
 than we had prior to doing that.
  </li><li>Right, and people won stuff, didn't they?
  </li><li>They did, yeah.
 If you, we sent out an email to our winners yesterday.
 So check your email, also check your junk folder
 because it's likely it's an email coming to you
 from an address you've never had an email before.
 But yeah, it was so good to just
 wade through this feedback.
 And you guys were very, very complimentary
 and it was a huge encouragement.
 And I think 'cause my first language
 is words of affirmation, I was just on this high
 for the last two weeks reading all the input
 or reading all the feedback as it came in.
  </li><li>Yes, you would randomly tell me little bits of things
 or read me little bits of comments and things like that.
  </li><li>All right, well, we wrote up an article on our website.
 If you go to Alan and AJ.com/blog, you can see some of the statistics there and a summary
 of the data that came in.
 But it turns out 66% of people who feel that are from America.
 America.
 We love America.
 God bless America.
 Miranda, get back in your shell.
 H.A. you just offended 66% of her listeners.
 No, only those from Alabama.
 What percentage is that?
 I don't know.
 I'm 22% of you are from the UK. Let's hear your various UK accents.
 A moon lick nickname.
 Okay, you've just defended everybody in Scotland. If indeed that was Scotland.
 I gotta give me some eggs. That was horrible. You need to cut that out. That was just so bad.
 So leaving it in. Do you want to alienate our English audience?
 No.
 Are Welsh listeners?
 I was oh, it's a pot of rainbow.
 It's no pot of rainbow.
 It's not a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
 It's Jesus.
 Maybe that was Irish.
 All right, let's move on from the same.
 You're listening to 6% of our listeners came from Canada.
 E.
 OK, well, you can make fun of Canadians because you are one.
 Cool.
 Look, look, look, look, look.
 I mean, we'll all understand that.
 Okay.
 Very good.
 Okay.
 Anyway, do you believe that part in bit?
 Okay.
 Well, it's fascinating.
 If you would like to read the rest of the feedback that came in, head on over to Alan
 AJ.com/blog and you should see that.
 One of the things that I didn't write in the article because I just worked out is the
 average length that people would like our podcast to be is 51 minutes.
 We're going to have to do more yodeling.
 We can make that happen.
 Goo, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look,
 How can I get there?
 And am I living it now?
 I started to think of other people that I look up to, like the two of you, for example,
 my question is, do you think you guys are living your destiny right now?
 Or do you think you have a greater destiny?
 Do you actually know what your destiny is?
 Do you think a person has more than one destiny?
 Is destiny something you arrive at or something you live in?
 Has there ever been a moment that you thought, "Ah, this is it.
 I'm living my dream or my destiny right now?"
 That's an amazing collection of questions.
 It is.
 Why would you like to start, AJ?
 Well, I guess I think destiny is a process or process depending on where you're from.
 Go on.
 Do I think I'm living in my destiny?
 Yes.
 I think I'm living in my current destiny, but I think that destiny is something that grows
 as you walk out your relationship with the Lord.
 So I think I'm on the path of my destiny,
 living my destiny right now,
 but not living my future destiny
 'cause I think that it's bigger.
  </li><li>That's a great answer.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>Because I think we're here
 because we said yes to the door that God opened
 six years ago to come here.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
 I think too, like, I still have a bunch of dreams
 that I know are God dreams that I haven't seen fulfilled.
 So I know, I know I'm not done.
 You know what I mean?
 I know, I know, I, and, and to qualify that,
 I love what we do and I don't wanna work anywhere else.
 And I don't necessarily think that the things
 that God has for me means we will be somewhere else,
 but I think things just get bigger.
 I don't know how to explain it other than that.
  </li><li>It would be fair to say that God's shown you stuff
 in addition to what you're doing.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>That has a greater impact than what you're currently doing.
 Yeah, that's exactly right.
 Right.
 I think if you look at someone like Joseph,
 you should probably pick anybody in scripture,
 but Joseph's a great example for this one.
 So his destiny was foretold in dreams
 way before any of it came to pass.
 And if you just take a high level interpretation
 of those dreams, basically they're saying,
 Joseph, you're gonna be a person of influence,
 you're gonna be an authority over others,
 your life is gonna be marked by favor.
 Right.
 And then if you look at any aspect of his life or any journey, any season of his life,
 all those things were true.
 Right for example, the prison, the palace, you can see elements of his destiny.
 And he didn't actually have to wait until the palace to see that destiny fulfilled.
 So for example, when he's in prison, there's so much favor on him that the head guy in
 the prison puts Joseph in charge of everybody.
 Like what's that?
 That's a foreshadowing of what his life is going to look like.
 And so you just see this framework, I guess, in Joseph's life that adapts to any geographic
 situation or every life situation he faces.
 It is just, you know, a flash of that destiny is hung on the skeleton of his destiny.
 I'm not even sure if that makes sense.
 Sure.
 So basically Joseph is walking in his destiny in every moment just because his heart basically
 is synced with the Lord.
 And the destiny just keeps unfurling and getting bigger.
 Right.
 And obviously, you see the dreams he had as a boy absolutely fulfilled at the end of his
 life where literally his family is bound down before him.
 Right.
 But all through his life, you see woven into the circumstances and the fabric of his life,
 his destiny.
 Yes.
 So do we think we're living our destiny right now?
 Absolutely.
 Right.
 I think we found that in our life that God may give you a vision for your life, but most
 prophetic words and most revelations show you the destination.
 It doesn't show you the journey.
 So here we are in Nashville doing what we do and doing what we love, but none of us,
 none of us, plural, neither you or I would have guessed this would have happened five
 years ago.
 No.
 And do we have moments where you go, wow, this is it and I've arrived?
 Yeah, kind of like all the time. I think gosh, I get to do this like I get to be in full-time ministry loving people training people
 You know
 Preaching like I get to do this
 For a living. It's like I get to do the fun stuff for a living and in the context that we're in
 I mean we just love Grayson or so much love Jeff and Becky love the staff that we work with again
 Five years ago, we didn't know these people existed so we wouldn't have been able to plan this destiny
 It's pretty cool though to be paid to be a church because I'd be there anyway, right? Do you know me?
 So anyway, but Laura Beth you asked do we think we have a greater destiny?
 I I hope so if this is the sum total of anointing that I'm gonna have in my life
 I wouldn't be happy about that. I mean I love that I can teach and prophesy and minister the love of God
 But I absolutely think I'm in the shallow end of what God actually wants to pour out on the earth
 Yeah, dude. I totally want to raise the dead like I want to call me dude
 I did
 Thanks bro
 I mean, I want to I want to see so much more of the kingdom right and so we're we're volunteering for that
 And I also think that God will give you more of whatever you steward well. Yeah, I tweeted
 I think last night, I don't know why I was thinking about this, but I was thinking about
 the whole right now is practice for your future.
 And I think I made some comment of, if you're not stewarding what you, if you're not being
 responsible with what you have, what makes you think you'll be responsible what you want
 to have.
 Right.
 And so my question is like, what are you stewarding now that God could breathe on that would look
 like what you will be stewarding in the future?
 One of the tricks of life is reconciling what is happening now in your life with what you want to be happening.
 Jeff was teaching this morning and he talked about Abraham getting an incredible prophetic word about your childless right now,
 but actually your descendants are going to measure more than the stars.
 It took 25 years before he had this first descendant.
 What do you do for those 25 years?
 And how do you keep from getting bitter or losing faith, losing hope?
 Well, I think you just get home with life.
 Yeah, you push into God and you do what's in front of you.
 That's that tension where often everything makes sense in hindsight.
 Like when I was a school teacher, for example, I was like, Oh, God, this really
 isn't what I planned on doing with my life.
 But you've actually led me here.
 So I'm going to try and be the best teacher I can for your glory.
 Little did I know that the years I was working as a teacher was preparing me for what I do now.
 Like you work so hard as a school teacher. Yeah. The speed with which you have to develop curriculum
 and classes and courses. Well, that's literally what we are doing in this summer. Yes. And that's
 what we do every week, you know, in preparing teaching. So I never would have thought that what
 I was doing then would have prepared me for what I'm doing now. So that's our encouragement to you.
 If you are getting up and it's Monday morning as you listen to this and you're going to a job you don't like
 Take great encouragement. It's the training ground for what God's gonna do next in your life
 You know, I think we've talked about this before but we was trying to everything is unto the Lord
 You know like I get it. It's not fun to work it
 You know Chick-fil-A or Starbucks or you know wherever there might be but it yeah, I mean if you can go in there though and
 just
 Have fun representing God where you are and makes it so much better like I was just thinking when you're talking about teaching
 When I worked at National for five years other than when I was in sales, which was only about maybe seven months of it
 I
 Loved working at National even though I was in a garage and you know all like just because I was like there's so much opportunity
 to love people and
 Walk out the gospel here and I had so many wild
 Things happen, you know, that were so fun.
 And even before that, like working in restaurants got to lead people to the Lord and just be somebody in that place that knew God.
 But even if you think, I mean, that's all amazing what you said is amazing, but even if you think about the practical training, you got working for an international company.
 Like, you know, for one season, those five years, you were paid to basically pass to the staff.
 Yeah, for like a about a year and a half. I was going to say an hour and a half for an hour and a half. I got paid.
 Yeah, it was about a year and a half.
 I was totally paid to just meet with the management,
 talk to them about their dreams
 and what their goals were for their life and all that kind of stuff,
 and then rearrange them into teams that would work more effectively with each other.
 And then I basically just got paid to go and meet them,
 take them out for lunch and see how they were doing.
 Isn't that funny?
 That's really funny.
 If you were wondering where to start with understanding your destiny
 or how does what I want to happen reconcile with what I think God might want to happen?
 My encouragement is to start with Psalm 27, verse 4. It says, "Delight yourself and the Lord
 He'll give you the desires of your heart." In my experience, that giving, the desires of my heart,
 was twofold. First of all, as you spend time with the Lord and as you literally find delight
 in him and as you step into an understanding of him delighting in you, you find that two
 things happen. First, he gives you the desires of your heart. And what I mean by that is,
 it's not that he replaces the desires that are in your heart, but there is a sense that he gives
 you desires because I think that the desires we have in our pre-Christian state often point to
 what God's built us for anyway. But they're often, like I said earlier, in the shallow end of
 what he plans for us, they're too small. So what I mean is like the largest I could dream of,
 like, you know, going back a number of years, the largest I could have dreamt of, God doing a favor
 for me is allowing me to go to Toronto to one of the conferences, having somebody lay hands on me
 and me receiving quote unquote the Toronto blessing. Like that was what I prayed for and
 and hungered for years. And I just like to think that the Lord is like, you are adorable. Look at
 you. Not knowing that he was actually going to send me there to live to minister as a representative
 of the house and be spiritually adopted by John and Carol and have an inheritance there. I mean,
 that's just never in a million years would I have thought of that. So I think the first thing that
 God does is he really does give you, he upgrades, he perhaps even puts a desire in your heart
 that you didn't know was already there. For example, Heidi comes, exhausted, burnt out,
 just wants to quit the ministry. And yet there she is in the middle of Toronto,
 and the Lord just shows her thousands and thousands and thousands of orphans and children said,
 would you feed them? And she was just like, how's that ever going to happen? You know,
 so that was the Lord giving her a desire of her heart. It became her desire. Does that make sense?
 The second thing that happens is he literally gives you the desires of your heart.
 Same phraseology but different meaning I think he grants them to you.
 So my encouragement is dream really, really big.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, you can't really out dream God.
 But then just hold it lightly and let God direct how that thing goes down.
 That thing being your life I suppose.
 Yeah, because we couldn't have made anything happen that has happened.
 No.
 would have been really ugly to watch.
  </li><li>Yeah, and I think sometimes that's the mistake people make
 is they have an idea of what their destiny is
 and they try and make it happen.
 And it's outside of God's timing for it to happen.
 So it looks ugly.
  </li><li>Right.
 You know, one of the questions you asked
 in the multitude of questions that you asked,
 Laura Beth, and I mean that in a really nice way,
 I loved your question, it was brilliant,
 was you said, has there ever been a moment
 where you thought, oh, this is it, I'm living my destiny.
 I would say that frequently in the midst of my week or in the midst of our week, we're
 driving around Franklin just doing our grocery shopping or going to our caraport or whatever.
 I'm just driving around and I inhale and I just think, "God, this is amazing.
 I feel so grateful and fulfilled and satisfied that we get to live here."
 But again, I don't think what God is doing right now in our lives is the sum total of
 of what he will be doing, we're simply trying to blossom where we're planted and love where
 we're at. And we truly do, don't we, babe?
 Yeah, we really do.
 I have a question of you though. Often our prophetic words, especially the ones that come
 out of left field, point to our destiny. Talk to me about getting prophetic words that mean
 nothing in the context of your life now, but mean everything in the future of your life.
 I don't understand the question.
 Well, for example, a number of years ago, you know, early on, you had five major prophets
 over five years give you the same word.
 And in that context of your life, it meant nothing.
 No, I thought they were all crazy.
 You were a waitress.
 I was a waitress.
 So in what way did those words begin to sink in and then change the course of your life
 or change the decisions you were making to walk out what God was pointing you at?
 I don't know if those five prophetic words are the best example or not.
 I mean, I sort of wrote them all off.
 I had a girl.
 And didn't, I know, right?
 And didn't really, um, didn't really take them seriously.
 I mean, I probably you were saying, you know, the best you hoped for is that
 somebody from Toronto would pray for you.
 I think if I was thinking about life down the road, I was thinking, well, maybe one day, y'all
 get married to somebody nice and own a townhouse.
 Do you know what I mean?
 like I don't think I had big dreams or anything like that. But at that season of my life,
 my dream was to survive, you know. But I think those dreams were seeds that God watered
 through giving me a series of dreams about speaking. And because of those dreams and
 because I knew that God spoke to me through dreams, he got my attention with, well, if
 you won't listen to them here. You know, here's some dreams.
 I don't think I know that part of your story.
 Really? No. What dreams did you have?
 The January after the fifth prophetic word, I had a dream where I was speaking in a stadium.
 I was speaking in a skydome, which is the stadium in terms.
 Sure.
 And it was like a big, like worship evangelism thing. And I was telling my testimony in a
 a whole bunch of people got saved.
 And I woke up from that dream and the Lord said,
 "Are you gonna let me use your life to minister to others?
 Are you gonna let me use your story to bring life?"
 And that's what all five prophetic words
 had been about ministering in God using my life to heal others.
 And I remember just thinking,
 "Dude, I can barely brush my teeth in the morning.
 This is just too much."
 But of course, when he's giving you the revelation,
 it's not like it happens tomorrow.
 Then there's the process of walking it out
 him getting you ready for it. But that I woke up after that dream and I said, "Okay, Lord,
 I know it's you talking, so I know those prophetic words were you too. It wasn't them all missing it."
 And so I say, "Yes, but I don't know how you get me there because I didn't like traveling and I
 didn't like speaking and I didn't like people." So there was a journey, a lot of years of healing.
 You know, I don't want to get too excited here or to, I don't know, super spiritual, but you're
 sharing this story and I'm feeling excited about what God is stirring in the hearts of our listeners
 about what God could do just by interrupting your quote and quote normal life and dropping a
 different direction or a different vision or a different hope. And that was certainly our story,
 wasn't it? We both lived very, very normal lives. And for whatever reason, you know, in my head,
 I think I volunteered for a lot of it. I don't mean that to take credit. The reason I say that
 is I think you hear a lot of stories of people who are in ministry or things that God has done
 in people's lives and you just think, "Oh, I wish I was chosen." And that was me. I'd kind of
 disqualified myself from a lot of stuff. So I volunteered for it. Like, "Hey, God, you know what? But
 I'll do anything anytime, anyplace anywhere.
 Right.
 Like, so I'm not trying to point to the awesomeness of Alan.
 I'm trying to point to the fact that you can volunteer for anything in God's
 kingdom anytime you want.
 And I have a sense that people listening to this are going to stop what they're
 doing.
 Just say, actually, yeah, God pick me.
 That that's me.
 Like if there's vacancies in heaven for incredible destinies, I say pick me.
 I'll do anything, anytime, anyplace anywhere.
 Yeah.
 So if that's you and that's resonating with your heart,
 We're going to lead you in a prayer in a second.
 All right.
 You know what was great last week?
 And by great, I mean awful.
 What?
 Our school website went down.
 Oh, it did.
 It went down.
 Well, it then went down.
 Our secure certificate that protects all your data expired.
 And as a result, the server didn't operate, which was a good thing, I suppose.
 But a bad thing in that we just talked about how awesome the school is on our podcast.
 when I was preaching last week, played the school video and so people went to try and apply and couldn't get in.
 But the good news is that it was only down for a couple of days is back up right now.
 It is.
 Our school is an eight month school and we would love it if you would come and spend eight months here in beautiful Tennessee at the Grace Center School of Supernatural Life.
 It's an incredible school. Go to schoolofsupernaturallife.org to watch video test studies of students who've been through the school to learn more about the school.
 And you have until June 15th, not long now, two weeks to get an application in,
 but we'd love to spend eight months just watching God transform your life and
 you learning how to acquire tools to step into your destiny.
 And if you're one of our alumni and you're still thinking about your two, come do it.
 No, I mean, totally pray about it, but totally come do it.
 Totally come to it.
 We're going to have a party.
 You want to come.
 My wife's the influencer.
 Sorry, I'm a little excited.
 And if you would like to ask us a question,
 we would love to answer your question on air
 and just talk about whatever you would like.
 Head over to allen and AJ.com/ask
 and we'll do our best to answer your questions.
 But for now, we would love to pray for you
 as you are doing whatever you're doing
 as you listen to this,
 that God would invade your life,
 that he would add to the goodness that's in your life
 and that you would begin to have dreams
 and excitement about what he's called you to no matter what stage of life you're in.
 So why don't you repeat after me? Maybe do this. Put your hand on your heart.
 Leave the other hand on the steering wheel if you're driving. But just say this, Father God.
 Father God. I want to partner with you. I want to partner with you. And all that you have for me.
 And all that you have for me. And the destiny that you have for me. And the destiny that you
 have for me. And so today, and so today, I say yes, I say yes to all that you have for me,
 to all that you have for me, and for whatever needs to happen, and for whatever needs to happen,
 to get me where you want to take me, to get me to where you want to take me. Amen. Amen.
