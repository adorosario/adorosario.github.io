<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to episode one ninety seven of keeping up with the jones is where this week.
 I'm john by my good friend and super genius blake stratton.
 Mm that's right that's i'm glad that you get my note from the for the intro for super genius your agent passed on most people don't include that and that really frustrates me i got your writer and you'll notice that there's no green m&amp;ms and your little m&amp;m file.
 For regular listen to the show you can already tell that something is missing and that's because a j is in australia this week with your wife no less like.
 Yeah, well, jealous, how you feeling?<br/>
 Wifeless.<br/>
 Well, feel a little bloated.<br/>
 I had a whole pizza last night in lieu of Alana's absence.
 I just watch basketball and eight pizza all night.
 Are you, I might get you into trouble here, but you're powerful.
 She's powerful.<br/>
 I have very low need for quality time.
 So I don't miss AJ when she's away.<br/>
 Where are you on the quality time spectrum?
 Yeah, I knew we'd have a bonding moment about this.
 Because I have a giddiness when I realize how much alone time I might get in a day that I didn't anticipate or that I'm not used to.
 Right.<br/>
 So I will say that this is the longest I think, or this will be the longest that Elena and I have been apart, I think since we've been married.
 And so there is an element for me of like, I feel like I'm floating almost like, "Where's my person? I don't know what to do."
 Oh, I guess a lot of stuff does happen when she's here and now those things aren't happening and
 There is definitely a oh, I didn't realize
 There's an element to I think and in Elena
 I'm not just saying this because I know you're gonna listen to this
 But there's an element to our love that I think I didn't
 Fully understand since we've never been apart this long since we've been married right that being said
 Basketball and a whole pizza isn't a bad way to live
 AJ is ministering with our friends Gary and Sarah Morgan at their school of profits.
 And then school of profit is actually running their first conference called the Speak Conference
 again with Gary and Sarah.<br/>
 So that's where she is.<br/>
 And AJ, I don't know if you know this, AJ had a dream that Elena was with her in Australia.
 So AJ is being the person that she has called Elena and says, "Hey, would you, I don't
 even know if AJ told Elena that."<br/>
 But she said, "Alain, do you want to come to Australia with me?"
 And Elena was like, "Yeah."<br/>
 So Monday we dropped off our respective wives and wave goodbye to them.
 Yeah, that's awesome.<br/>
 I've been very excited about this trip and I'm excited for tales to come from this conference
 this weekend that I'll be at.<br/>
 I mentioned last week by way of pre-introduction that you actually helped AJ and I get started
 in podcasting.<br/>
 Like all of this is your fault kind of.
 That is maybe a gross overstatement, I feel like, because you are, I was saying this because
 you probably love it this house.<br/>
 I'm going to say it again.<br/>
 You said this is episode 197, which means you were three episodes away from 200 episodes.
 And the thing is, when you said the first time, I don't know if you remember this or
 if I said it out loud, but when you said, "Hey, I want to start a podcast," you know,
 can you talk to me about podcasting, what we should do?
 Because you had a podcast.<br/>
 I had a podcast.<br/>
 And you'd help other people start podcasting.
 helped other people with podcasts.<br/>
 And the thing is 99.9% of people, myself included,
 reach a point where like any new thing
 that seems like it would be really fun,
 but actually requires a ton of effort<br/>
 and long-term commitment.<br/>
 They burn out, they quit, they get other interests.
 And so a little bit I was like,<br/>
 yeah, totally just do this.<br/>
 I remember saying, listen,<br/>
 you don't need to spend very much money,
 just use GarageBand, just get this little mic
 because you never know--
</p><ul>
  <li>Still here.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>There are, but you never know.
 And then here we are, however many years later,
 and I, four years, I just can't believe,
 I mean, to be honest, when you asked me
 to join you on this podcast,
 I took it really seriously because I think
 you have really diligently served an audience
 consistently for a long time.
 And that does, and everyone, you can't hear them
 'cause their podcast, as soon as they're all like
 clapping in their head right now,
 they're in the crowd like, yeah, they have done a good job.
 So anyway, I've been very, very impressed with a small, like 15 minutes of training.
 And now I'm in, but you have got a faulty memory.
 You know, it wasn't 15 minutes.
 I remember you, you actually lent us everything to start.
 We borrowed our first microphones, our first cables.
 You taught us how to hook it up to the Mac and you actually edited the first 20
 or 30 episodes.
 Maybe we would record and then I just upload a Dropbox you would edit it all and
 And then sooner or later I was like, okay
 I think this is gonna be a thing because a G and I were like, what would we even talk about?
 Like we were thinking we don't even have anything to talk about for 10 episodes
 So you need to you need to take more credit than you actually have for and actually the microphones that you recommended
 Still live in our studio today. They're used when we have guests come in the great microphones
 Do you have my address for the royalty checks? Yeah, actually, well, I'm glad that you're here because there's just a big bag of pennies that I'm gonna be
 Handing out here on the way you're gonna love it
 Other eagle-eared listeners. That's a phrase of you. I've just coined now eagle-eared listeners will recognize Blake's
 Sultry tones from episode 111
 When you weren't technically on the show, but you interviewed me at my old house. Remember? Does God want you to be rich?
 Oh my gosh, because one of the podcasts you have or had such a good.
 Oh my gosh, it's called are you linking to that?
 There are so many wisdom bombs in there.
 It's like, I just love that you you came over and we're like, Hey,
 I'm Elena and I are going to start this podcast called white flag wealth.
 This is the idea behind it.
 I'm like, Oh my gosh, this idea is brilliant.
 And you're like, can I just sit down and talk with you?
 And I'm like, yeah.
 And then I move you just shot the breeze for an afternoon and then you left and I completely
 forgot about it. And then maybe two, three years later, I had to go somewhere. Something happened.
 And I realized, there's no way age and I can record a podcast this week. So I think I called you
 and said, this feels really cheeky. But remember we did an interview for your podcast? Could I
 use that episode on my episode? And that's if you're like, where have I heard this guy before?
 you've heard him on episode 111 on the title that was really unprovocative called "Does God Want You to Be Rich?"
 Oh yeah. Not only that, but your incredible aforementioned wife, Alaina, was on our show
 not that long ago, episode 165, she came on and talked about navigating disappointment. We got
 so much amazing positive feedback from that message. Yeah. Super helpful. She's the best.
 She is, she's amazing.
 She is like, she's a walking person.
 Yeah, she's great at walking.
 Sorry, you were going to leave space because you were going to put a perfect
 edit and then no one would know that you were thinking and I just ruined your flow.
 This is what it's like not having your wife here.
 She knows.
 I'm fine.
 No.
 I'm trying to think about how to express it.
 I feel like whenever I'm around Elena, I'm provoked to want more out of life.
 She gets that a lot.
 Right.
 She's like this. She's like so full of life.
 Have you ever been in a restaurant and you're watching somebody, you know,
 bring like a glass that's way too full over to table and you think this is not
 going to end well and just, you know, kind of run it down the side.
 That's what Elaine is like. She's so brimming with life that if you get in touch
 with her, have a conversation with her, say hi to her.
 Life is overflowing and it always provokes me to want something more when I'm
 on her and then don't even get me started about when she starts dancing.
 And anyway, she's amazing.
 Episode 165 if you haven't listened to her.
 So I say all that to say you are no stranger to the Joneses.
 But for the audience who's tuning in, who perhaps is the first time they've heard, let me, let me, let me introduce you.
 Super genius.
 Is that what the first, I mean, is there more than needs to be said?
 I've known you for what, like seven years?
 Seven, seven years almost to the day.
 I moved back to Nashville from Reading in 2011.
 And I met you, I think, my second week back.
 Wow.
 I thought it was good that I got the year right, but you've got to the day in the month.
 Okay, perfect.
 I would say no sense of flattery here that in my observation of you and we've worked
 together.
 You were staff at the School of Supernatural Life.
 We've worked together on projects at Grace Center.
 We've worked on the podcast.
 We've known each other.
 Like I said, for seven years, you are one of the hardest working people I know and I
 know a lot of hardworking people.
 I would say you are remarkably solid instead fast.
 I've known you and I've seen you go through ups and downs
 relationally, you know, through job stuff.
 Your perseverance is amazing.
 You're clearly intelligent.
 You can't be a genius without being intelligent.
 This is one of the things I love about you Blake.
 If you've got such a brilliant ability
 to think outside of the box,
 but you can translate that to help linear thinkers think.
 Do you have this unique skill of thinking deeply, but communicating simply?
 I'm glad we're recording this because I'm literally going to listen to this every
 morning just to get a good amount of time.
 I'm just thinking about you and thinking you've got this brilliant ability to
 help people get unstuck in their lives, especially in the area of business.
 And you know, you're part of our community, part of our church community.
 I've been part of the school community.
 You're deeply loved by everyone.
 And you're just like this person who I've watched.
 You're like a 10 talent person.
 Like anything that the Lord gives you,
 you are so good at multiplying.
 And here's what differentiates you
 from other people who do that.
 The thing that I've noticed is even in your
 like rapid acceleration of growth,
 you haven't been tainted by what I call the expert mindset.
 So the expert mindset is you reach this place,
 this pinnacle where you work hard, you think hard, you've paid a lot for the mistakes you've
 made and now you're in this area where you genuinely do have experience and skill and
 understanding.
 But not most people.
 I've noticed a lot of people who reach that stage, there's hodiness or pride or criticism
 when they encounter people who don't know what they know or don't think like they think.
 And I've just watched, I've been in conversations with you where you have scolded me so gracefully
 where I'm like, "Hey, I'm struggling and wrestling with this, and it's so annoying
 because you just ask me a couple of questions."
 When I say it's so annoying, it's ultimately incredibly helpful, but I realize all the
 whole time I was talking, thinking I was trying to demonstrate how much I knew so that you
 could pitch your advice to, "I'm kind of like a semi-expert," you were just giving
 me rope to hang myself with.
 Then in a couple of deft questions, I realized, "Oh God, I know nothing."
 There's no pride in your heart.
 There's just a genuine desire to help people prosper,
 to move forward to grow.
 So my very first question is,
 how did you get so awesome?
  </li><li>Oh, time out.
 Let's jump on that was,
 how to fill a love tank with Alan Jones.
  </li><li>That was all true.
  </li><li>I know, wasn't it?
  </li><li>You know I'm a three shooter.
  </li><li>Yeah, I don't wanna just make a joke.
 I actually want to receive that.
 It's like,
  </li><li>Are you crying?
  </li><li>No, listen, you knew that was gonna happen.
 You never have a stratton on your podcast.
 There's gonna be some emotion.
 Thank you very much.
  </li><li>All true.
  </li><li>Thank you. - It's not flattery.
  </li><li>I understand that you don't do flattery.
 You don't do compliments.
 You do thoughtful, genuine words of affirmation.
 You do, the other thing you do is,
 I was thinking about this this morning.
  </li><li>Is what's happening right now,
 words of affirmation, Tannis.
  </li><li>Are you returning to surf?
  </li><li>It was so boring, they're like, oh my gosh.
 No, but I will just respond to one quick thing,
 which is the thing, and I think you can confirm it in ice,
 but I think a thing that has drawn me to you
 in friendship, in pastoring, of course,
 but also in friendship has just been the love
 of wisdom that you have,
 which everyone, of course, is just not in their head.
 Like, oh yes, Alan, he loves wisdom.
 And I love that, like I love.
 So when you say, oh, you know,
 it asks me these questions,
 I can't, you can't do that with everyone.
 You can only do it with people that on a level,
 love wisdom or want to learn, want to grow.
 So you're the easiest person to look like a genius quote,
 I'm doing air quotes people,
 to look like a genius around
 because you're just this,
 you position yourself as kind of a dry sponge
 to absorb whatever gold or wisdom someone might be carrying.
 So you make it really easy.
 I see what you did there.
 But my question is, like, where did you learn everything I just
 thought about?
 Like, where did you learn your love of hard work?
 How did you develop this massive appetite for understanding?
 Because in every area that I speak to you about, so I'm not saying that you know
 everything about everything, but you know a ton about the stuff that is of interest
 to you and you're a huge reader.
 I mean, your appetite is enormous.
 And you've got this amazing ability
 that everyone who meets you likes you.
 So you network in a way that's not sleazy.
 But I have conversations all the time.
 You're like, oh yeah.
 So I was speaking to this titan of industry.
 And I'm like, wait, how did you get in the same room
 with the person who's booked?
 I've just finished reading.
 You're like, well, you know, blah, blah, blah.
 So, but like, where did that come from?
 I think it's just paying attention to what about the Lord really catches my heart and
 then just agreeing with that as a legitimate theme in my life.
 So I've been caught, there's a handful versus John 10 10 sticks out.
 You and I have talked about that verse a lot, but this idea that Jesus came that we'd have
 life to the full is I just don't know what to do with that other than pursue whatever
 that means.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>This is what Alana and I have talked about this,
 but I think this is also a foundational part
 of our attraction to each other,
 'cause she's very much that way as well,
 of what is life to the full mean.
 And so it's part of why I love wisdom like you,
 because I'm just like, oh, there's more,
 there can be abundance in every area of life.
 How do I get that?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So I think that's one thing.
 I would say I would honor my parents as a big part of that as well.
 One of the skill sets that my dad has that he's instilled in me is asking questions and
 asking thoughtful questions.
 From an early age, that was a value instilled in me.
 He would bring me along on business trips and the joke was he would just make best friends
 with whoever we were sitting around.
 would be like, which is what you do. That's literally you.
 But anyway, so my dad is great at asking questions and gave me that value.
 And I think that maybe that's the short answer I could give you is just if you
 want to develop greatness, you need to become great at asking questions.
 Right. Because that is the entryway towards wisdom and the entryway towards
 growth. And as soon as you are satisfied with the level of questions that you ask, then I think you
 put a ceiling on the depth, breadth or height of your growth.
 But I've noticed you do that. I've noticed you ask genuine, like this being times when,
 when I've been the teacher and you've been the student, you know, when you're like, Hey,
 I'm struggling with this verse or this concept or I, you know, I'm thinking about this and what
 do you think? And so I've been in your company when you're asking questions because you want to
 learn, but I've also been when the roles are completely reversed. You're the master and
 I'm the student and you're asking me questions to help me see, which is a very, you know,
 Eastern approach to learning. It's what Jesus did. All of his, all of his learning, you
 know, and, you know, later the Socratic method of, you know, just asking questions make people
 think. So I noticed that you do that on both sides. Did your dad, you mentioned your parents,
 but did they, did they do that? Because what you just said is the first kind of question
 ask to learn, but you also ask to teach where do you learn that?
 Through rejection and sales probably.
 Are you kidding me?
 No, I've been serious.
 So I learning sales and marketing is...
 I should probably point out, I've completely failed to mention what you do.
 So why don't you tell us what you do?
 You are like, again, you have a company that you help people
 massively increase their sales.
 So you have managed to find a way to make sales and marketing not slimy, which we're going to come to in a second.
 Is that a good way of describing what you do for a living?
 Sure. Yeah.
 So I would categorize myself as a sales and business growth strategist.
 Right.
 I work as an independent consultant.
 People hire me because they've either hit a ceiling or they are hungry for growth and they know that they have an opportunity,
 but they're not really sure where their leverage lies.
 Right.
 And I basically help give them strategy to.
 Impact more people, create more sales, create more margin in their life.
 That sort of stuff.
 But with a giant asterisk that you managed to do that without falling into the trap
 of the first 10 results on Google, which when you read them, they're all nauseating.
 Like I can't emphasize enough how you managed to do that authentically
 with the brands and the people that you're working with not having to change their core identity.
 Mm hmm.
 Yeah.
 No, I would say it's a big value.
 I think it is the key is deeply embracing your identity, actually, and also having a deep
 understanding of the identity and the aspirational identity of the people you're trying to reach.
 All right.
 So I didn't mean to interrupt your flow, but I thought it would be good to actually tell people
 who you are and why I'm asking these questions.
 So you were saying you learned to ask questions
 to help other people learn by being rejected in sales.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm, yeah, continue.
 I love telling people what's right.
 You asked, where did you learn this?
 I would say I was not, and I still think I have
 a ton of room to grow in this area.
 A ton of room to grow.
 But I can look back five years ago, even and go.
 Yeah, I really loved discovering what the right thing was
 and then telling you what that was.
 Yeah, actually this is what's true.
 That's totally true.
 I get a lot of joy in that.
 But what I was gonna say even before you did this for living,
 you were a natural evangelist about great coffee.
 Oh man, you gotta try this restaurant.
 Not an obnoxious way.
 Like, oh for years you were my great source of new apps.
 Right?
 And you wouldn't tell me about the apps I didn't care about.
 Oh, oh, Alan, dude, you need to check this out.
 This was built for you and you'd be on the money.
 So you know, you are very much a natural,
 a healthy influencer, a healthy evangelist.
 So I'm just affirming that.
  </li><li>So in a sales context, the first job I had
 in business development was a lot of trial and error,
 a lot of learning, okay, what does it take
 to actually get someone on board,
 especially when I, if I, this is a big assumption,
 but when you think, oh no, this is perfect for you.
 And yet someone then walks away
 and doesn't actually take action.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Well, what didn't, what was that about?
 Why didn't it work?
 And so that rejection, I think, led me to study people
 that were way better at sales, at marketing,
 to study those things.
 And to be honest, it's a characteristic.
 You mentioned Jesus and his style.
 That's a characteristic I've always been drawn to
 in Christ is his ability to just like a hot knife
 through butter to completely change a conversation
 and get to the core issue.
 Because people would always come up to Jesus
 to talk about one thing.
 And then he oftentimes through a single question
 would change the conversation to be about the person.
 And in sales, people will hide behind the logic
 of what you're selling, but there's usually
 emotional reasons that are tripping them up from seeing
 is this a good fit for me or not?
 And so by asking questions, it's just better leadership,
 I think.
 sales, most people think that sales is about convincing other people to do something.
 I really disagree. I think sales, kingdom sales, is about leadership. It's about
 and you can't lead unless you're serving. So Jesus is actually serving of all. If you want
 to lead, you need to be able to serve. So if sales is leadership, leadership is service,
 "Okay, how can you support someone in a transformational journey?"
 You can't just drag them into that.
 They need to feel powerful through the whole interaction.
 Otherwise, it doesn't stick.
 Because it's not a choice that they may, they just go,
 "Oh, was I just manipulated?
 Like, or was I?"
 But like if they are the ones saying,
 "Oh, yes, actually this is what I think about that."
 Or this is, and yeah,
 So I don't think that I'm at great at that.
 Definitely not as good as people that I admire and respect and have tried to learn from.
 But I do think that that is one of the most valuable skills to develop, whether it's in, in sales or in any type of leadership role.
 Well, I'm glad you started down this track because one of the main catalysts to get you on the show is a number of weeks ago.
 we received a listeners question that I thought,
 this is such a good question,
 and it deserves a much better answer
 than I could come up with.
 And to be honest, it started provoking my thinking,
 and I ran out of vocabulary to explain why I think
 what I think.
 And I remember calling you and saying,
 "Hey dude, I got this listeners question,
 I think you'd be brilliant.
 Could I just, you know,
 I will do a show and then just kind of call you in."
 And you're like, "Sure."
 And I was like, "Wait, no, no, no.
 If I know Blake, this is gonna turn into a whole topic."
 He won't be able to fit this under 20 minutes.
  </li><li>Okay, so here we go.
 This question comes from Becky.
 And she asks, "I've often heard you, Alan,
 talk about how it's much better to let God promote you
 than to promote yourself."
 And I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit
 about what that looks like for entrepreneurs
 and people who are in sales.
 For example, if a photographer is wholeheartedly following
 the Lord and also building a photography business,
 would you recommend that they don't do any self-promotion
 just trust the word of mouth referrals approach. Or, if a musician is releasing a new album,
 what do you think is the wisest way to approach sales? I've heard many successful entrepreneurs
 and business coaches talk about the importance of promoting your product, value, etc. And
 they give tips for overcoming the fear of self promotion. And I'd love to hear you weigh
 in on the subject. And I started trying to answer it and I just realized, I'm tripping
 myself up. I'm contradicting myself left, right and center. That sounds like, you know
 I'm just going to call Blake.
 I'm going to hit record and I'm going to listen to what he says and then the problem is solved.
 So Becky, here's Blake.
 Awesome.
 So Becky, I wish you were here in this room because I just went on about how important it is to actually ask questions.
 And I can't ask any more questions.
 So you might be able to maybe answer on behalf in terms of knowing your listenership, knowing maybe what you
 You meant right you were talking about self promotion, but my first question would just be.
 Oh wait you're going to pull the question voodoo move on me aren't you here but the ninja me not necessarily.
 So there's questions that are designed to help someone learn and maybe you kind of know where you're going,
 especially in sales it's even more powerful to just answer ask a question with no pretense right to actually listen.
 And that listening is actually part of my answer to this question but my first question would just be what do you mean by promotion right.
 Are you asking you alan johns are you asking the type of promotion i don't like to think i'm having this reaction to so when becky writes in and says hey you said this thing about self promotion what is what we talk about what does i mean what.
 In my world what it usually comes up is somebody want something for me and they think the best way to get it is tell me how awesome they are.
 So it's not uncommon for people to tell me like hey i've just moved to grace and you would have no idea how good i'd be teaching school supernatural life and here's all my accolades,
 rather than me getting to know them they present me with their accomplishments.
 I heard this a number of years ago jump all jacks and said when he was talking about.
 training young profits he said this he said if you have to tell anybody who you are they'll never believe you.
 But if they tell you who you are you'll never be able to convince them otherwise and so i'm a strong believer in the book of proverbs obviously where says the gift makes way for his giver and i should look into the presence of the great like your gift will make room for you know i love that verse.
 I know i'm being serious there's actually a really amazing clip of steve harvey talking about that verse on youtube on the show yes that's the party yeah and.
 change my life well the other one is probably seven to let someone else praise you not your own mouth a stranger not your own lips.
 So for example if we're a dinner party and i meet somebody who i would really benefit from your services and i say i'll bob you need me blake you really helped me with this i think you really be helpful to cut this amazing ability to think to ask questions.
 He's gonna take my recommendation that i've just given about you for great if you walk up to me like hey bob i'm like you have no idea how amazing i am asking questions like i'm really good at this and i can totally help you.
 That's kind of what i'm talking about and so you know one of the companies i admire most is apple do apple do self promotion yes do they do it brilliantly yeah do i feel slimed when i'm around you know they're marketing collateral not at all do i see that another individuals for sure but the basic principle.
 is what i'm talking about when i say self promotion where you end up being.
 Talk to rather than talk to you feel an agenda rather than a value to that help me helps why do you think the lord dislikes wait wait wait no no no no i see what's going on here i brought you on.
 To dispense wisdom not not to be asking me quite you're the expert tell me the answer.
 This is how we're going to get there.
 All right.
 OK, I'm willing.
 I'll be student.
 So it's-- yeah, this is more so I want to share a point.
 And to be honest, I'm not sure the best way to get there.
 But I know that the people listening to you who have been here
 for almost 200 episodes worth, they align with how you think
 and how you communicate.
 And so my goal is actually that something would be helpful,
 that something would land.
 Do I need to wrap my head in ten foil? I feel like you can see inside my soul right now.
 Keep going. My hope is that something with land, and so is my best opportunity to do that,
 to just start talking and rambling, because I can ramble. You know that. I think a better way,
 if I can ask you some questions, I can help people track with where we're headed.
 I'll be the conduit. Cool. So that's more. So I'm not trying to grill you or test you.
 You're also just trying to give us a pathway.
 I trust me from rambling.
 I trust your methodology.
 So go plus I will appear way smarter when I keep my mouth shut.
 That's also on the Bible, I think.
 So I asked you why is that in the Bible, what is it about that that makes the Lord
 go? No, you don't want to do that.
 So one of the major themes of the Bible is having trust in God, which is not
 theoretical, it's a lived out thing.
 And in the Old Testament, the Lord would consistently warn the people of Israel not to trust in Egypt.
 All right, this whole metaphor is don't don't don't put your confidence in the strength of horses or the strength of man.
 Don't don't go down to the princes of Egypt.
 Come to me.
 So the message of the Bible is don't forsake me.
 And I think that verse isn't about your brilliance being known.
 That's not what the Lord saying.
 It's like that approach to your brilliance being made known will not work.
 You, you by your own lips confessing is kind of like I have to, I have to make
 away for me.
 I'm literally running to Egypt.
 I'm running to princes.
 I'm putting my trust in in horses rather than the Lord will establish me.
 So I have promoted you because you are a person I believe in.
 I don't think that's wrong.
 I wouldn't have done that.
 Just think how, how far people would have gotten this podcast.
 If you started saying those things about you, like, Hey,
 I'm so glad it's about time that you've had a million
 shows, so 196 episodes, do you not realize the wisdom I, you know,
 that would just be off putting to everybody.
 So that's why I think the Lord is saying that because he
 ultimately wants his people to prosper.
 He just doesn't want them to get in the way of them prospering.
 I love that answer.
 Two things I took from it.
 One, you said trust in God.
 And the first thing I thought of was insecurity.
 Right.
 And insecurity is about identity.
 Well, it's Bill Johnson's whole thing of insecurity is wrong.
 Security exposed.
 Mm hmm.
 So smart.
 Isn't he a smart?
 So the Lord doesn't want us to be insecure and he doesn't want us to fail.
 Right.
 So I think that's something to understand and to catch when you think
 about this question of self promotion and, you know, like the heart of the Lord
 is that you would have security in who I am, God,
 and also who you are, and that you would prosper.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So, I think then,
 let's put it in terms for the business person,
 or for, you know, you bring up a brand like Apple.
 I guess something that I think about is,
 Like a lot of things God will give us commands about or instruction about.
 It is what is our heart position where what is the quality?
 What's happening in our heart?
 And I'm, as you said, you can actually see an advertisement and it doesn't feel
 slimy. You've mentioned people that I've helped. Oh, yeah,
 they're able to run this ad or to promote this thing or do it.
 And it doesn't feel off or slimy or manipulative.
 And yet sometimes it's the same exact thing.
 It's but they're both as, they're both whatever, right?
  </li><li>Isn't that the weirdest thing?
 I can see two Instagram posts
 that are essentially the same thing.
  </li><li>Uh-huh.
  </li><li>Like I follow a lot of pastors, for example.
 And I can see two pastors post exactly the same thing.
 Maybe it's something about the services just happened.
 And, you know, at a craft level,
 they are talking about the church that they lead, right?
 But both of them are doing that.
 One of them I can be inspired
 and encouraged by, I think that's amazing.
 And the other, I just go away going,
 oh, that just smacks of self promotion.
 And yet on the surface, they're exactly the same thing.
 What is that?
 Are we picking up on motive or like,
 how does that happen?
 And how do you stop it happening?
  </li><li>Yeah, I think I just asked you more questions
 based off the first question.
 I haven't let you answer yet.
 So I apologize, do whatever you want.
  </li><li>So I was thinking about this self promotion thing
 before I came over.
 'Cause I knew there was some element about that
 that we were gonna be talking about.
 And the more I thought about it,
 I was thinking, oh man,
 I may just be a blank on this podcast
 'cause I don't think about self-promotion at all.
 Like I don't think about it.
 And I think that that is the difference.
 So to answer this last--
  </li><li>I'm gonna stop you right there.
 Okay, 'cause that would be like me saying,
 I don't think about preaching at all.
 (laughing)
 You know, I just never think about podcasting,
 but your job is to help people
 businesses, corporations, entrepreneurs, musicians, whatever, to communicate to a wider audience
 about themselves.
 You're helping people promote themselves better.
 How do you never think about self-promotion?
 Because I think more about connection and transformation.
 I would say for the person struggling with the reason, so the reason I would love to have
 Becky on the line or someone is because I could ask questions to sort of uncover what's really behind this fear around self-promotion.
 Because in her defense, I think she's saying, like, I'm making this up.
 I don't know Becky's reason for asking this question, but let's say I'm, I'm a podcast.
 Listen to this show and I, you know, if I've been listening, I'm like, I actually value
 L and age, you have to say, and I've started this catering company.
 And obviously in order to be a successful caterer, I need clients.
 in order to get clients, I need to tell them about it.
 But hang on, I think I hear Alan, you know, say,
 "Don't do this thing that I feel like I need to do."
 Could you clarify that?
 I think that's where that question is totally.
 Totally, totally.
 So I was in the business track of our source conference,
 which by the way, since that track, I've been a mess.
 I've been like a human puddle in God's goodness.
 Like it was the best thing ever.
 If you've never gone to a conference at Grace Center,
 you'd go to one.
 You can also get the MP3s,
 even if you didn't attend the conference, I'll put a link in the show so you can go
 by the MP3 sessions for all the tracks, but you were at the business.
 Goodness. Yeah. So good. But the reason I didn't mean to lump Becky into this, but a
 number of people asked things about self-promotion in the business track.
 Right. And in Becky's situation, it's more of like, wait, I want to walk in obedience.
 I want to stay in authority. I actually want to do right. I've heard this, but I feel
 like I should be doing this.
 So how does that, I totally get that,
 it's not necessarily a fear of self-promotion or never,
 but I have noticed particularly in the church,
 there's a lot of like mixed emotions,
 anxiety, feelings around promotion, advertising,
 marketing, branding, any of that stuff
 to the point where I have to be creative
 about how I talk to people about what I do
 because church people, non-church people,
 there's usually less of a thing, although sometimes there is,
 but there is this thing of self-promo--
 Oh, I don't know.
 And so the benefit of having someone here is to ask,
 OK, what is really behind that?
 Because I think for some people, they're really struggling
 with that, but they're not struggling with self-promotion.
 They're struggling with insecurity.
 So that's something that you don't actually need to learn.
 Well, should I be promoting my band or my photography
 business, or should I not do this, or should I?
 How many times should I, you know,
 and it's like, actually, if we fix the identity
 insecurity thing, you don't have to think about self-promotion.
  </li><li>Because.
  </li><li>Okay, because.
  </li><li>All right, connect the dots.
  </li><li>Finish the sentence.
  </li><li>Okay, okay, okay, okay.
  </li><li>Hey, little creative thinker,
 I've got linear thinker over here who's like,
 "I got you, I got you, but I feel like you did one, two,
 And then 14, 9,900.
 Thank you, thank you for stopping me.
 So if I am totally,
 if I have complete like trust in God,
 if I know that my needs,
 if I have security in my identity,
 if I believe that when I'm delighting in the Lord,
 He's giving me the desires of my heart,
 if I believe that God's totally for me
 I have security in all this, then we had already identified the reason God doesn't like the
 self-promotion thing.
 The reason it has a stink to it is that it's based in this insecurity.
 What is that insecurity?
 The insecurity, at least in my experience, because it's not like, I should also mention
 that I've walked through this.
 It's not just, "Oh, why is everyone having problems with this?
 I don't have any problems."
 It's like, "No, I've totally been there."
 100 percent.
 And there's a lot of insecurity about, am I really good enough?
 What if I can't afford to pay my bills?
 What if I am a failure?
 Is what God said about me really true?
 I think about David, and David was anointed king way before he ever became king.
 And the amazing thing about David was the lack of self-promotion, right?
 Right.
 And in fact, like the times where he was questioning his identity, I was just listening to talk about this,
 but the times where he was thinking to himself, like, "Oh, this is gonna work."
 Like that's when his men started to turn on him, things sort of went bad, but like as long as he was
 strengthening himself in the Lord and acting in accordance with his identity,
 His anointing his king.
 An army of guys came to him.
 He always escaped death.
 He was fearless to like go and
 you know,
 fight and be right, you know, but like
 even he had saw
 he could have taken his position right then.
 But he had security in who he was.
 And so I think if you have
 security,
 then you don't ever need to reach.
 You don't need to fight.
 And so the thing about self-promotion
 when we, the stinky way, so I'll call it,
 is that the stink that you feel is there's a sense of,
 yeah, God's called me to this, but I need to reach.
 I need to make this thing happen.
 And if I don't make it happen, it's not gonna happen.
 And if you don't understand,
 if I don't get your validation,
 then it's all rooted in this like.
  </li><li>And that's what I'm feeling
 when I'm scrolling through Instagram and it feels off.
 You can feel it.
 Yeah. So let me ask you another question. So I mean, I'm tracking with you. I understand
 the point. I'm trying to ask you what does it look like. So let's say I'm a photographer.
 I've got a start of photography business. I'm in Franklin. I know my market and I'm really
 confident. And in my identity issue is gone. Now what? Surely from the outset, it still
 looks like I'm doing self promotion. Because when you say you never have to think about
 self promotion again, you mean I never have to be questioning my motives about it? Because
 I'm going to still be taking Facebook ads or whatever, whatever the strategy is.
 No, even more than that.
 So I never have to think about self promotion because I'm thinking about
 transformation, not about myself, but about who.
 What is that look like on Monday?
 I've got $10,000 to spend on on transformation.
 Does that still look like more like help me with that?
 Cause I feel like what you're saying, but I need it in concrete language.
 We'll get there.
 Okay.
 Good.
 So transformation, who's transformation?
 You're doing that thing again, where you're looking at me.
 I'm looking at you.
 Yeah, yeah.
 This is not a rhetorical question.
 OK, so I don't think about self-promotion because I'm thinking about connection,
 connection with who?
 And with my customer base question mark.
 Uh huh.
 Absolutely.
 Connection with my customer base.
 Right.
 And once I connect with them, my hope is that they are transformed.
 Right.
 So a couple things need to happen in order to see that happen.
 So connection means there needs to be understanding,
 there needs to be trust, there needs to be vulnerability.
 There needs to be a deep compassion.
 I'm a firm believer that all good, if you want to call it promotion, advertising, marketing,
 great marketing always starts with compassion.
 So I take these principles literally from the life of Christ.
 So for God so loved the world, right.
 So everything is rooted.
 This whole idea of spreading this gospel, of bringing this gospel was
 rooted in love for specific people.
 And I think promotion starts the same way.
 A lot of people, let's say someone's securing their identity.
 I'm a prophet to the nations.
 Hey, Alan, you probably don't realize this,
 but I'm a prophet of the nations.
 I think I should probably get up on Sunday
 just I think spoken enough.
 Let me get up there and speak.
 That maybe that person maybe is feeling very secure,
 but that's only half of it.
 The other half is, okay, so you have this identity,
 you have this skill set, you have this gift,
 your voice is a gift to the world,
 your everyone needs to hear your album.
 It's half baked.
 There's another piece.
 And that's that other piece is why I don't have to think about self-promotion.
 So the other piece is who?
 Okay, God.
 Um, this is my identity.
 This is the skill set.
 Uh, this is, you know, maybe the, the place you've planted me now.
 I want to be moved with compassion.
 So who, who's my, I, I, I'll help people with this.
 This is usually the one of the biggest parts is that you need to be, uh,
 in love. Not in a weird way, but you need to be consumed with compassion for your audience.
 If you want to never annoy your audience again, be consumed with compassion with them.
 You know why? Because guess what? Sometimes you might annoy them, but you'll be annoying
 the wrong people. You'll be attracting the right people. Jesus had an incredible ability to
 annoy the wrong people and attract the right people. So this goal of, "Oh, I don't want to be a
 knowing our, Jesus also, he knew we, like we think Jesus just came to save everyone.
 Jesus said, the sick are the ones who need a doctor.
 So he was comfortable, ignoring, ticking off people that didn't need a doctor.
 Of course, we all need Jesus. Of course, we all do. But he came for the people who were hungry
 for what he had. He was motivated by compassion and he knew and deeply cared about the people
 that he was coming for. He actually had identified in his mind, "Okay, who's a good fit for
 what I have to bring?" Because I have a limited amount of time. If you're listening and you
 have a business or you have a project or you feel like you have a calling, maybe you feel
 quite confident. Maybe you're like, no, I don't have an insecurity issue or I feel
 too look, but maybe the other side of that is how well do I really know the people I'm
 trying to reach and people I'm trying to serve. So if I'm consumed with connection and transformation,
 that makes the rest of business and marketing quite easy. It doesn't make it easy. It's
 still very challenging. It makes the heart issue around it quite easy. I teach people
 about leverage and the greatest leverage you can ever have is spiritual alignment is believing
 that God is completely behind and for what you're doing.
 If you don't, if there's a tiny, tiny little crack and you're not 100% sure, you will put
 a low ceiling on what you can accomplish and the people that you can reach.
 And in my experience, when I started in sales and market, I was like, "Yeah, this is kind
 of a necessary evil.
 It makes the world go round, but you know you got to do it."
 Sales and marketing is really?
 Sales and marketing, yeah.
 It's a necessary evil to get by.
 Yeah.
 and shifting that around, that doesn't work for someone like me.
 I need to be completely aligned with what I'm doing.
 If I then can see sales and marketing in the life of Christ
 and I can follow his model, now I'm like, oh, yeah, I'm obsessed with sales.
 I tell people all the time, like, if you want to become a more compassionate,
 loving, unselfish, aware of others, impactful person, just learn sales and marketing.
 Most people think, oh, if I'm a salesman, I'm selfish and it's like, no, no, no.
 So I mentioned connection.
 You have to know who your people are.
 And if you, the times where self promotion feels like, ew, is because what?
 Because this feels like it's more about you than it is about me.
 It feels like it's more about you getting to do the thing that you think you're
 born to do more than it is about serving.
 And actually Jesus gave you that gift so that you could serve.
 a specific group of people with that gift.
 And that actually brings deep fulfillment in a way that doing your own thing.
 Never can, at least in my experience.
 I never thought I would have fulfillment sales, but seeing my clients
 transformed where it's like, Oh, we feel so stuck.
 One of my clients was like, getting ready to sell the business.
 And then I am able to charge them money
 because I want to see them transformed.
 I'm going all over the place right here.
 I'll put a bookmark there mentally.
 I'll come back to that, but seeing them transformed.
 See, and by that in my standards, it's they, they doubled their customer base in two months.
 So they came in feeling like really small, really like trapped.
 Oh, we got to just clean this up and sell the business.
 Blake, can you help us with anything?
 Shift a couple of things around.
 They feel more powerful.
 They feel like, Oh, this is amazing.
 their customer base grows.
 And they decided not to sell because they realized,
 oh, maybe we still will sell, but let's wait a while
 'cause this is just going up and up and up, right?
 That is way more fulfilling than if I were to just be like,
 I'm gonna write my book about, and I do wanna write some.
  </li><li>I was about to say, and when is the book here?
  </li><li>Because, but it's the difference of like,
 if you feel like you're struggling with self promotion,
 people just don't get it. Enjoy that. Enjoy the hitting your head against the wall part,
 because what that will illuminate to you is God has something more fulfilling for you
 than what you think this thing is. You think that I hear people oftentimes they're talented
 photographers or musicians or creative people. They know they're good at a thing, designers.
 If I could just do what I'd just love to do all day and I just didn't have to worry about the money,
 If I just didn't have to worry about them,
 you know, my bills were paid, I could live comfortably.
 That's really just what I want.
 I don't want to be, I'm not a marketer,
 I'm not a salesperson, you know,
 if I could just do this thing that I love
 and we think that that is just the epitome
 of what professional occupational fulfillment will look like.
 The Lord has so much more
 and it's all hiding behind sales and marketing.
 It's hiding behind, and the reason it's hiding behind that
 is because sales and marketing forces you,
 if you're gonna be good at it
 and some people will use it to manipulate
 but the Lord uses it for good.
 It forces you to become compassionate about a people.
 And so there's a huge difference between,
 oh, I'm just gonna do my thing
 and not do about the bills to like,
 no, actually when I'm doing my gift
 and I'm seeing people transformed by it.
 And the transformation of those people matters
 because I cared about, I had a deep understanding,
 I empathized, I sink in, I felt their pain.
 So if I'm just doing a design work,
 I have to think about whatever.
 When someone uses my design work,
 their success, it's nice.
 As long as I'm comfortable, it's fine.
 But if I had to sink into their pain,
 and then I got to walk them through
 this really vulnerable process of going,
 yeah, this is where you're at.
 And the Bible says where your treasure is,
 there your heart will be also.
 So I'm obliged to ask you to make an investment
 in your own transformation.
 'cause I believe that there's transformation
 therefore you, but you gotta be invested.
 So pay me for this,
 and we're gonna give you this design work
 and it's gonna help your business flourish.
 Now, when there are business flourishes,
 the level of fulfillment is so much greater
 than if you had decided to cut short
 this idea of promotion or sales.
 Does that make sense?
  </li><li>Yeah.
 (laughs)
 I'm now just thinking everybody who's listening this
 and has a company or a product
 Who are now like oh?
 We need to rethink everything we're doing now what now what do they do?
 You joked about you haven't got a book and I was like what are you doing this afternoon? Why don't you write that book?
 But why haven't we heard any of this stuff before you have you have heard it? It's it's it's just
 Applying it you can you can find it in in the Bible you can find it in the life of Jesus. Oh sure Bible shame me
  </li><li>No, I really don't want it to be that way.
  </li><li>I mean, to see.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Wisdom and revelation is hidden, we have to find it.
 So it might be there, but.
  </li><li>Yeah, so, but practically like what would you do?
 You asked two different questions.
 Why haven't we heard it?
 I would argue that it is out there.
 And that there's, it is such a big step.
 If where you are right now is just finally believing
 that God has a purpose for you
 and you haven't gotten to the whole sales or whatever thing yet.
 That's amazing for a lot of us and for me included,
 that's a massive step and a massive journey.
 So first of all, honor that.
 If you've already like figured that out and, and you know,
 oh, I've got this gift or this thing I want to bring to the world.
 But there's another stage to it where it is, okay, God, now, like, who do you?
 Who do you want me to reach?
 And what's the, what's the best way to reach people?
 And a mistake we make is we think, well, this is just.
 I hear this from artists a lot.
 We live in Nashville and I'm from the music industry,
 so that's why some of my examples are with artists.
 But I know a lot of times it's like,
 I just want as many people as possible,
 and whoever, it's for whoever,
 and we think we're being generous,
 we're actually being quite selfish.
 Because--
  </li><li>When you see my head shake,
 it's because my brain's discombobulated.
 So how am I to send that statement to selfish?
  </li><li>Why is it selfish?
 It's selfish because it doesn't cost me anything.
 and I don't have to understand, sympathize, empathize,
 develop compassion for other people.
 And I actually will be satisfied,
 as long as I can do my own thing, I'll be satisfied
 'cause oh, whoever, however many people,
 if I'm committed to people's transformation,
 though, that's a very unselfish thing.
 That actually cost me quite a bit.
  </li><li>So you're saying there's no care
 or no thought in the first approach.
  </li><li>Well, there's care and there's thought.
 It's all about me though.
 It's all about my product, my thing.
  </li><li>How many shares are there like 10% of the month?
  </li><li>I struggle with this all the time.
 So one of my biggest struggles
 is when I'm selling consulting services,
 I think, oh, people really need help with this.
 So I'm gonna develop this whole thing.
 I've done this, well, these are really example.
 I developed a whole course around emailless building
 for artists.
 I want you to guess how many artists purchased that course Alan
 100,000 250 just guess so this is your course for independent
 I'm in a course about email this building for for artists who want to grow there
 Master market over here. I sold zero
 zero of those courses the master guy who's gonna tell everyone how to do it and
 the reason that failed was because I
 I had decided that I knew the answer before the people I was trying to reach even knew they had a problem.
 Whoa.
 And so the self it seems on so I'm going to make this thing is going to help so many people is actually a selfish thing because I didn't have to become vulnerable to somebody else.
 Defining their problem or defining what they actually want a lot of people will.
 Sab is in Silicon Valley all the time.
 They get funding for their great idea and it flops.
 They can't make sales because they didn't start with, well, who are we trying to serve?
 What, what do they actually want?
 What are they telling us that that they want?
 You've done this really well with the podcast, like you'll survey your audience
 and you'll make adjustments likewise.
 Just another point.
 Who, who's idea was that about serving your podcast audience and then to, oh, that was yours.
 Was it?
 Yeah.
 I genuinely don't remember.
 (laughing)
 Okay, so practically, what might that look like?
 I would say
 clearly define who you're serving.
 And I'll give you a couple of,
 and maybe you'll be like,
 "Well, I'm an artist, I don't know what to..."
 Like, what I would say is,
 what impact do you actually wanna have
 on someone's life with what you're doing?
 What is, and for some of you,
 you've never even thought of that.
 You've just thought, "Oh, I just love what I do."
 And maybe you're a painter.
 Oh, I love like, I just paint, you know, I feel the Lord
 and you know, I hope people buy it.
 But like, just think for a minute about what's someone,
 what's the impact?
 And if you don't know, ask the Lord.
 Ask the Lord, like, who is this for?
 I forget that I'm talking to people that are like
 learning how to hear God's voice and like, no, this stuff.
 So like, yeah, that's your greatest asset.
 Ask the Lord, God, like, who have you made me to serve?
 And the answer might surprise you.
 'cause it may be someone that you're like,
 oh wow, I could never reach that people group
 or I never even thought of that people group
 but ask the Lord, like who have you called me to serve
 and then ask the Lord to give you a heart for those people
 or give you a heart of compassion
 and then put that into action, get on the phone with people.
 If you already have a customer base, get on the phone.
 I was helping this new startup
 that was equipping worship leaders and worship teams
 in smaller churches, just the most noble thing ever.
 And they weren't really getting any traction.
 And it's like, oh, this is such a great idea.
 Like, why isn't it working?
 And so often we can't see past our great idea.
 And I said, hey, Blake, can you write new copy
 for our website?
 And I said, yeah, but here's what I'll need from you
 is I need to get on the phone with at least five people
 that has your target audience.
 And I need at least a half hour with them
 and just go on the phone.
 'Cause I don't know what they care about.
 I don't know what problems they have.
 I don't even know, is this even a problem?
 Do they even see that this is a problem,
 what you're trying to solve, what you're trying to give them?
 'Cause if not, it doesn't matter how good a copy I write
 or what you do to your whatever, like it doesn't matter.
 And doing that, getting on the phone with these people,
 I was like, move with compassion.
 I was like, oh my gosh, like you're going through this.
 And so then I sit down to write my sales copy,
 my self-promoting, whatever it is,
 it's not self-promotion.
 I don't think about self-promotion.
 I think about Janet who gets up at, you know,
 five AM on Sundays and tries to get her team of volunteers
 there and time and the drummer doesn't show up
 and he doesn't know the parts.
 and she's stressed about this or that,
 and their church is getting smaller
 'cause the lead pastor left,
 and they don't, like, I moved with compassion.
 I'm not trying to sell.
 I'm not trying to convince.
 I'm not trying to manipulate.
 I'm not trying to make sure that Janet knows how great we are.
 I'm just trying to sync with where she's at,
 and knowing that I have something that can help her
 in that transformation,
 I'm going to clearly demonstrate a pathway to do that.
 So I started practical and then I sort of went into a story example, but I hope that was helpful.
 So again, I'm hearing you say all that.
 You've given me like a hundred more questions.
 I'm lucky because I'm in relationship with you and you know, I can call you and say, hey, that thing you said, other people can.
 I would imagine anybody with a business or anybody who's facing the challenges you're talking about are like, keep talking, don't cut them off.
 But I have to feed my children.
 So how can people get connected with you?
 What resources do you have available?
 What great starting points would you give
 for people who want more?
 And actually if people want to secure your services,
 what's the first step in getting connected with you?
  </li><li>Right, so if you're listening to this
 and this has been helpful or it's sparked a thought
 process in you that you'd like to develop,
 I want to give you some resources.
 So first, I'll share maybe some,
 a resource that might be helpful on this last idea that we were talking about of shifting,
 taking this step from, "Yeah, I know what I like to do.
 I know what my product is.
 I know what I value up to offer, but I haven't really.
 I'm realizing I don't know my audience or how to communicate to them or all that type
 of stuff."
 It's not exactly the thing that I've been talking about, but a short book that's worth
 keeping on your shelf is "Building a Story Brand" by Don Miller, which you and I have talked
 about the story brand framework.
 He loved it.
 He has, it's really well told.
 So go and buy that book, pay money for it,
 because where your treasure is, your art will be also.
 If you wanna be transformed, you don't have to hire me,
 but you may wanna pay somebody,
 something, some type of investment.
 If you want to, I would love genuinely,
 I would love to know if and how and in what way
 this was helpful, because I'm also in a place
 where I'm trying to learn like, okay, God, who's,
 you know, who can I help?
 Who, you know, what aspects of this message do you have
 or do I have to share?
 And so you can reach me probably the easiest way,
 if you just wanna do it right now,
 or your phone is on Instagram,
 I have an account where I really only talk about
 this perspective on business.
 And the, what is it called?
 Handle, username, abundance, marketer.
 the word abundance, the word marketer.
 That's all it is.
  </li><li>I'll put a link in the show notes.
  </li><li>Cool.
 So that's if you just are interested
 in kind of my perspective on this
 and you can slide into my DMs.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>You.
  </li><li>And then, you know, I have a website
 and on the website, depending on what your needs are,
 if it is a fit for us to connect even if
 for a short conversation or with more types of consulting,
 you can go to blakestratton.com.
 That's the website you can share with people.
 That site is a little half baked,
 but there are resources there for depending
 on where you're at and if you want to take a step,
 you'll be able to get a hold of me through that.
 I wish we had more time because you're
 the type of personablator that says--
 And I apologize if this for straight anybody, but I had to.
 Your dead person says something and you know, you're looking me like I totally
 understand what you just said and I have to do the thing.
 I'm sorry.
 Stop the train.
 When you say this, what do you mean by that?
 And I just, I love that.
 I mean, most of our lunches and coffees are while sprawling, where we interrupt
 each other to check the world.
 And I love all that.
 I just wish that we had more time.
 Thank you for taking time out of your day to answer Becky's question.
 I know that Becky got way more value than my, I mean, I couldn't even finish my
 thought because I was tripping myself up on the very same thing that we were just
 talking about that.
 No, I don't believe that people hearing about your products as bad.
 I don't know.
 And then I run out of words and you've really helped me understand why is I feel
 IKEA about some things when I don't about other and on paper they're exactly the same.
 And you know, your the revelation you dropped is just profound.
 For those of you who have been listening to this, everything that Blake has said, I'll
 put links in the show notes to everything we're talking about, encourage you to reach out
 to Blake.
 If this has been an encouragement to you, just reach out to him on Instagram, thank him for
 mentioning this.
 And if on Monday when you see the posts about our episode, if there's people that you're
 you're thinking, man, they would really be
 benefited by listening to this.
 I just have a conversation with a colleague about this,
 whatever.
 Pass on this episode because I want people to hear
 Blake's wisdom far and wide.
 But for now, Blake Stratton, I thank you so much
 for joining us.
 We both go back to our lifeless lives.
 Yours is gonna be filled with basketball and pizza.
 Mine is just gonna be filled with YouTube videos.
 And I guess I have children to look after too.
 So I'm, yeah, I'm gonna go look after them.
 But again, thank you so much for being here, Blake's friend.
 the best, none of this would have been possible without you.
 An absolute pleasure and honor.
 Thank you so much and thank you everyone for giving ear to my ramblings.
 Faith, life, communication, tacos and video games
 Pale you donuts in the kindness of God
 But things we deal with every day
 From Franklin, Tennessee
 They are just like you and me
 Alan, and AJ
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 Sharing their life, experience it
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 They talk about faith in God
 And everything under the sun
 If you are a human being
 There's something here for everyone
