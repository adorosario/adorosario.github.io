<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Hello Mr. Jones.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Hello sexy librarian.
  </li><li>I'm wearing my glasses today.
  </li><li>You are and thank you Jesus.
 Episode 253.
  </li><li>It's episode 250.
  </li><li>We're gonna be talking about kindness.
  </li><li>We are.
  </li><li>On this episode.
 Before we get to there, I'm interested to know
 how your week has been so far.
 Oh, wow, it's been a crazy week.
 It's been good.
 We had the small group leaders retreat over the weekend, so it was away with that, doing
 some training and hanging out.
 You forgot that we actually recorded last week's episode on Sunday night, and we talked about
 you being aware of the small group leaders.
 Oh my gosh, it's all a big blend, isn't it?
 Yeah, it's a big blend.
 It's crazy.
 We had the first day of school then.
 Talk to me about that.
 First day of school.
 Yeah, we had the first day of school.
 It was great.
 We already had a couple people out sick, but yeah, it was really good.
 And how was the teacher?
 Oh, very sexy.
 He's very sexy.
 Where's a lot of pink?
 Used to have a Scottish accent, but now it doesn't anymore.
 And I heard the school director is really sad about that, but that's just rumor.
 The school director has in, I heard you introduced our kids the Proclaimers.
 I did.
 With the hope that as they sing the Proclaimers songs, my accent will come back.
 No, no, no, that was Tia's idea.
 So basically I was playing the Proclaimers in the car and saying, you know, like, Daddy's
 accent used to be pretty strong, like not quite this strong, but pretty strong.
 Never last.
 And Tia was the one that was like, maybe we should just start playing the Proclaimers
 around the house and see if that helps.
 And you know, if we can get some of the accent back.
 It really does.
 Like if I listen to them, yeah, I can.
 I noticed that hangs out in my.
 We had to ask what havering was.
 I could never remember every time they sing about havering.
 So Tia was like, what's havering?
 I said, I don't know, I was daddy.
 I think it's like gabbing, which is essentially what it is.
 It's never. Yeah. Yeah.
 Chating, talking nonsense.
 Chating, chatting, chatting, you read, hey, but.
 You do a fair amount of that, actually, just saying.
 I come by, honestly.
 It's a great Scottish pastime.
 Oh, I know something else that we would do this week.
 I've tried something called hello fresh.
 This podcast is not sponsored by Hall of Fresh.
 I can tell you don't listen to a lot of podcasts because you said that like it was a new thing.
 They're going to be introducing our audience to a revolutionary break-through thing.
 The next thing you're going to be telling them is that Squarespace is an easy way to build your website.
 Oh my gosh.
 Oh my gosh.
 Oh my gosh.
 Tell us about Hall of Fresh.
 I'm excited.
 So...
 What about Casper Matrices?
 So, we have one of those two and it's quite good.
 No we don't.
 upstairs in the gas.
  </li><li>Oh, is that a cash from?
  </li><li>That's a cash from?
  </li><li>Okay, I stand Christ.
  </li><li>That's great.
  </li><li>Ooh, I like it when you say I stand corrected.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Okay, I stand Christ, I don't even know.
  </li><li>Tell us about Alaphragm.
  </li><li>Okay, so basically in the last couple of weeks,
 like ramping up to the schools coming,
 that means the next eight months look, you know,
 a lot busier for us.
 And I usually get to Tuesday night
 and I don't want to make a decision about food.
 Actually, Tuesday, Wednesday,
 I don't want to make a decision any of those days.
 And, but I do typically cook at home.
 So I was signing up for a parent teacher conference.
 And of course, you know, you get like little advertisements
 and I got this little advertisement for HelloFresh.
 And so, you know, I got to try it out
 for like a ridiculous price.
 So I was like, oh, I'm gonna try it.
 So we got our first box yesterday.
 And actually it was really good.
  </li><li>It was really good.
 Until I started the end that you forgot
 to put one of my favorite ingredients in.
 Well, it was something that could go on the side
 and I didn't think the kids and I wanted it.
 And then I forgot to just toss it over by where you sit.
  </li><li>Yeah, okay.
  </li><li>You know, like you toss something to,
 like a piece of meat to like a lion or something.
 I was gonna-
  </li><li>Speaking of lions, was that your stomach?
  </li><li>That's my stomach.
  </li><li>Good.
  </li><li>I know.
  </li><li>So you like it?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>What's for dinner tonight?
  </li><li>Well, if I do the one that I was thinking of doing,
 It is spinach, spinach jonky with some sort of tomato garlic Parmesan thing.
 All right.
 There you go.
 Hello, fresh.
 Hello, fresh.
 Not sponsoring this week's episode.
 But I think there's like a gajillion different companies that do that.
 I just happen to try that.
 It's my stomach and it is so loud.
 What did you eat for lunch?
 I ate what we call freezer chicken, so pre-cooked chicken bites with a scoop of siziki and
 a couple of corn chips.
 I know your stomach might be rumbling.
 I enjoyed being at school.
 It's like you mixed food groups.
 You mixed Mexican and Greek.
 We're not doing it.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 Go back to what we were talking about.
 Oh, I'm sorry. No.
 Yeah. I loved your little segue.
 School was fun.
 I really enjoyed being with the students.
 Yeah.
 It was really fun for me to meet several of the students
 who I was with last year online.
 Yeah.
 In person.
 Yeah.
 And actually being online with people for a year
 where their name is permanently fixed to the kind of lower
 left quadrant of a screener. Yeah, I almost knew every single person's name that I was
 teaching, which I felt pretty about.
 It's pretty great. Yeah. I mean, it was, it is funny because you're used to seeing them
 about, you know, this big on your screen. And all of a sudden they're live and in person.
 And yeah, it's really lovely. Ask me what I'm excited about from this week.
 What are you?
 Apple event, new Apple products. Uh, Apple had the first of what I hope is a couple of fall
 events and they introduced new iPads which weren't the more new iPads, new
 watch which were not the market for new watches. So down I'm turning 50 in the
 fall maybe I'll get a new watch. Is that what you would like? I don't know I'm
 thinking about it. I haven't decided if there's enough of a change for me to be
 interested. There might be though. Okay. Yeah. But the big thing then I suppose new
  </li><li>New phones.
  </li><li>It's so loud.
 Yes, new phones.
 And I'm gonna get one.
  </li><li>You're gonna get one.
 Which one are you getting just so you know?
  </li><li>The 13 Pro, but not the Max.
  </li><li>So this year you were on 12 Max, 12 Pro Max,
 and I went 12 mini.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Couldn't have been more different.
 Your thing is a behemoth.
  </li><li>It's massive.
  </li><li>And you were, why did you go with the Max?
  </li><li>The camera.
 So like, I obviously love photography.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I take all of my pictures of the kids.
 My stomach is so loud.
  </li><li>It is so loud, I apologize.
  </li><li>I take all my pictures of the kids,
 all the videos and everything on that phone.
 Really, I don't usually get out the,
 I mean, I do have a nice camera that you bought me
 like two years ago, but.
  </li><li>Yeah, don't rub that in.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>The nice camera that I bought you that you never use,
 but go on, maybe I'll read it.
  </li><li>I'll have to use it.
 you for your 50 look baby I got your
 You didn't Israel I take it on big trips where it's gonna be pretty anyway you owe me nothing
 So she goes glasses. I'll forgive everything
 The but my everyday stuff gets done with it
 So you wanted the camera. Yeah, it's all the way of the big phone not cumbersome for you
 You just got used to it. I got used to it
 But it is it is bigger and so that's why with the 13s
 They've got the good camera with the one that's like a size down. Yeah, which is more of a normal type size of phone
 So I'm gonna size back down again. So you're sizing by that. I'm sizing back up. I had a 12 mini
 Yeah, which I loved I love the weight and so weird though that phone looks like you're using a child's phone in your hand
 Yeah, so I'm scaling up. I also I'm getting a 13 pro in Sierra blue for anybody who cares
 Well, I feel like you're stealing my color because I had a blue phone before of course
 I'm getting a blue phone again and now you have come to but it's okay, baby
 Because imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. I'll give you I'm stealing your phone color
 Yeah, if you will just repent before our audience for accusing me of getting medical terminology wrong last episode because
 Well, we'll see I took Tia yesterday to get her rod removed from her finger the pain removed from her finger
 Yes, so quick recap Tia snapped off the top of her finger and
 and they surgically reattach it by driving--
  </li><li>It just caused me trauma by explaining it like that,
 but anyway, yes.
  </li><li>By driving a metal pin into the pinky
 and putting a little, they left the rod sticking out.
 You notice how I'm using those terms interchangeable
 and you understand what I'm saying?
 And there was a little yellow ball on the end of it
 and we had to clean it twice a day in.
 So anyway, yesterday was the removal.
 And I think last week you correct me,
 it's like it's not a rod, it's just a pin.
 And so we go in and what did the physician's assistant call it yesterday?
 She called it a rod.
 Yes.
 I would like to one up you though, because the doctor, not the physician's
 assistant, the actual doctor called it a pin several times.
 I'm going to put a pin in her finger.
 Then I will remove the pin for the three week appointment and just ask him to
 say, yeah, it's a rod.
 It's a rod.
 You call either one.
 But anyway, it got removed.
 I watched him pull out.
 He just used tweezers, not tweezers, pliers.
 Okay.
 Good.
 there were like more surgical really like oversized scissors with grippy bits.
 Wow.
 And he just grabbed the end of it and just
 you and she didn't she wasn't in pain or anything.
 Yeah, she was afterwards.
 She came home.
 Yes, but she didn't squeal or wince or anything.
 And I was like, that's so good.
 And then just blood was because the truth is I was really happy when I had a meeting
 scheduled at the same time, because I thought I can't do another traumatic doctor
 finger thing and it's your turn to do one on your own.
 I'm here my broad shoulders, character, family through it.
 Yeah.
 Our topic this week is all about kindness is something that I've
 been pondering for the last couple of weeks.
 I've, and it's interesting we're talking about Tia because I
 have been on the receiving end of much kindness.
 I know we've talked about the kindness of God and that's not,
 well, I guess we are going by extension.
 I'm more talking about the kindness that humans show to one
 another.
 I think last week when you were talking about, you know, being
 vaccinated. One of the comments you made was one of the saddest things we've seen in the body of
 Christ is a distinct lack of kindness. Yes. I'm talking about the distinct abundance of kindness
 our family has received and what's really done to my heart. And I thought we could unpack that.
 Yeah. Sounds good. So Tia's finger gets the thing that we just talked about. And almost
 immediately we were on the receiving end of kindness. Yes. My sister on hearing that news,
 I didn't even know this product existed. I wish I knew what it was. It's some sort of internet
 website where they prepay for a gift box of candy and send the recipient the link and then
 the recipient gets to pick which candy they want and then it arrives in the mail a couple of days
 later. Yeah. And so my sister was like, oh, I'm so sorry here. Tia's in the situation. Email Tia,
 this link. Tia just thought it was the best thing ever that her and uncle had thought of her. And so
 So she went, you know, I think she got miniature M&amp;Ms.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>She got sour watermelon.
  </li><li>You know that 'cause you ate most of them.
  </li><li>That's so good.
 I feel the earth move.
  </li><li>And a monkey.
  </li><li>Reese's Pieces.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then some other American candy,
 it was like Hershey's blah.
 Anyway, she was just thrilled.
 Now, I wasn't the recipient of that,
 although I did get a few watermelon pieces I've found.
  </li><li>A few, that's not what I heard.
 I heard she got like two of them and you ate the rest.
 Oh, right. They listened to this podcast.
 So I wasn't the recipient of that,
 but watching my daughter be the recipient of kindness
 really blessed my heart.
 Yeah.
 We also had friends of mine who...
 You're claiming exclusive to the friends of yours?
 They're my besties.
 You're friends with them too,
 but they're like my besties, just saying.
 Who dropped off this massive gift bag for Tia
 with also with like candies and all that kind of stuff in it.
 and like two Lego sets and just,
 they actually had stuff in that bag
 that she really, really wanted that I had no idea.
 They had done all the research.
 So I know.
  </li><li>Well, again, you and I are not the recipients of that,
 but there's something about watching your kids.
  </li><li>Oh, I felt like the recipient.
  </li><li>Oh, I did too.
 I mean, that really moved me.
 The kindness of your friends gifting my child.
 A gift like that was lovely.
 was wonderful. You don't want to
 rebut that. You just come out that
 go.
 You're she's going to be just your
 child. Let's check with her.
 Pretty sure she wanted me to do her
 finger for the last three weeks.
 Anyway, my point was being on the
 receiving end of kindness.
 Yeah, it was such a tangible
 thing. Like it like it really, it
 really moved me. Yeah.
 And was just thinking, you know,
 we've probably all been on the
 receiving end of kindness.
 And it's amazing.
 And we've probably all been on the other side
 where we've exercised kindness.
 And usually the cost to us of exercising the kindness
 is it costs us way less than the impact it has
 on the recipient.
  </li><li>Oh, I totally agree.
 I totally agree, yeah.
 However, I don't know if this was related.
 I have a suspicion it probably was.
 Around about the same time, we had a bunch of loved ones,
 friends, family, people dear to us, who all got sick.
  </li><li>Oh, I was thinking, friends, Romans, countrymen, yes.
  </li><li>You are in mood today.
  </li><li>Who all got sick with COVID?
 Some with young families and the people who are really close
 to us and I was just thinking, man, I am so sad.
 I want to be able to do something for them.
 And I wonder how much, you know, I think about kindness
 being contagious.
 We'll talk about that principle later,
 but it prompted me to just reach out and to say,
 hey, what can we do to help?
 like, you know, when you're, I got really blessed
 that when you're sick, I'm usually okay,
 or when I'm sick, you're usually okay,
 and we can keep things running.
 But I'm watching young families
 where both the husband and the wife are both.
  </li><li>Are both down with COVID, yeah.
  </li><li>And I'm like, do you need help running, you know,
 to the grocery store, a pharmacy store?
 Can we bring you a meat?
 Like what can we do to help?
 And I remember we have a person on staff, Tony Wakefield,
 who's one of our pastors on staff, who is, you know,
 is like the heart of Jesus in taste and flesh.
 He's just super guy filled with love.
 He is the walking embodiment of kindness in so many ways.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>And I thought about, I thought,
 I thought this is what it must be like to be Tony
 because on one day I did a run to a couple of families,
 you know, taking them soup
 and taking them groceries and checking in on them.
 And it probably took, I don't know,
 two and a half hours, three hours maybe.
 And I would say as much as they were thrilled
 and we got a kind text message, thank you.
 Being the deliverer of kindness,
 I felt like I got more out of that than they did.
 And literally all I did was go to Whole Foods
 and pick up some things.
 You made a batch of soup,
 I dropped them off at various places.
 Like it really wasn't a sacrifice at all.
 And I haven't talked to them like,
 yeah, on a scale of one to 10,
 I haven't impacted who you by that kind of,
 their text would suggest that they were deeply moved by that.
  </li><li>But you came home feeling like Santa Claus.
 Like you were so excited. - I came home.
 I was like, this is what it must be like to channel Tony Wakefield.
 Like, it's just being able, and I, and again, I am amazed that you can cause that impact
 physiologically on yourself and transformative late in your community, just by being proactive.
 Like you don't need to be led by the Holy Spirit to be kind, although, of course, you
 can be one of the fruits of the Holy Spirit for sure.
 But you can just decide, oh, I'm going to go be kind.
 I'm going to be kind to somebody who doesn't even deserve my kind.
 I'm going to look for a way to be kind to me.
 I'm in a bad mood, but you know what?
 I'm going to move in the opposite spirit.
 Right.
 You, if you will shift in your heart an effort to be kind, like it does so much
 wonders.
 So that's what I've been pondering over to you.
 I have been spending a bunch of time, as you say, pondering kindness as well,
 the last couple of months.
 And that being the thing that's probably my heart's been the most grieved about is
 I don't think, particularly it's obvious on the internet, but I don't think that we as
 the body of Christ are doing kindness well.
 I'm not sure we're doing loving each other very well.
 I'm not sure we're doing patience very well.
 And so I started pondering with the Lord about the fruits of the spirit and of course
 kindness being one of them.
 And I think because kindness requires action, we're really most of the fruits of the spirit
 kind of require action.
 It's harder because it's not just thinking it's a good idea.
 You actually have to do something.
 You know, you have to actually step towards something and decide to demonstrate it in an
 active way.
 I mean, if I'm sitting here, you don't know if I'm thinking kindly towards you necessarily.
 if I do something for you, you can recognize kindness.
  </li><li>I think it was last week, I mentioned,
 maybe the week before I mentioned
 moving furniture around the house
 and that gigantic piece of furniture that I couldn't do.
 And I was also thinking about how,
 I forget who it was that taught us
 that joy is a tender response to weakness.
 I know Christine taught us that,
 but I don't know where that came from.
 And I've always thought about that
 because the reason that stuck with me
 I remember one week, I was teaching in school and it was a brand new topic where I think
 I was teaching about brain science and either you'd got sick or the kids would got sick.
 Anyway, I didn't have as much time to prepare as I wanted to and I always want to show up
 for my students well prepared and I want to equip them and I knew I was going in with
 weakness because I didn't have everything I wanted to have.
 I wasn't as prepared as I'd like to do and I think rather than trying to hide that, I
 led with that like hey guys I feel some sense of sadness and maybe some shame
 that I haven't been able to prepare anyway I went in week and their tender
 response to my weakness was a kindness and it brought around joy for me but I
 was recalling that when a couple of weeks ago moving that big piece of
 furniture I was like I can't do this on my own that's my weakness and as I asked
 Matt you know a friend of mine if he would come and help
  </li><li>It doesn't have to be mine or yours.
  </li><li>And I was just thinking about like,
 you know, I had some sense of shame of like,
 nobody wants to move heavy pieces of furniture.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But do I have a deal for you?
 This afternoon, your only day off, you know,
 from working a heavy schedule,
 do you want to come over to my house and, you know,
 break your back and move some really, you know?
 Nobody wants to do that.
 So there's a kind of like, an awkwardness and like,
 hey, would you come do that?
 And he was like, yeah, I'd be happy to do that.
 He came over and I again is that tender response to my weakness. I can't do this could you help me?
 Yes, I can and I was just feeling like
 Again, I was the recipient of his kindness and I felt so
 Touched by that. I don't have another word for that. I've really been moved by this whole topic
 I could almost start crying thinking about kindness
 Don't make me cry. I'm not trying to make you cry. You're just so cute. Look at you really cute
 I think I'll keep you. I think I've decided. Do you want to know about some of the science-binding this?
 I do. Is there actual science? Like there is science science? There is actual science
 science. I've lost a power of speech
 Is there any science that tells you how to keep your glasses where they're supposed to be being new to the glass world?
 Yeah, what are you wearing glasses apart from?
 Well, that's because you're wearing
  </li><li>Yeah, it could be your greasy--
  </li><li>But you're, I'm not greasy, don't call me greasy.
 Oh, it is, look at the makeup on the inside of that.
 Nevermind.
 (laughs)
 Not greasy, it's makeup.
 That's totally different.
 (laughs)
 I was wearing them so I could look at my phone.
  </li><li>Which you don't have.
  </li><li>It's in my pocket.
  </li><li>Put the back on.
  </li><li>But then you said, are you wearing your glasses?
 They're sexy, so I kept them on.
  </li><li>I know, they keep them on.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Then I have to keep pushing them back up
 'cause they slide down my nose
 And then I'm like looking at her.
 Okay, we're going back to science.
 Yes, science.
 All right.
 This study, this was a study.
 I think I read this in one of Dr. Daniel A.
 M.
 N.
 Books.
 I forget which one, but he said this can being kind to others make a meaningful
 difference in your level of happiness.
 So dull in one breath.
 Psychologist Sonia
 the year were risky from the University of California River.
 I'm sure that's how it said.
 Decided to put this question to the test with the
 control study that asked students to carry out five weekly random acts of kindness, of
 their choice.
 It could be anything from buying food for a homeless person to helping a younger sibling
 with schoolwork.
 The students reported higher levels of happiness than the control group, with students who performed
 all five kind acts in one day feeling the best by the end of the six week study period.
 Oh well!
 happens is when you show kindness, it boosts serotonin in your body.
 Serotonin is one of those like, uh, it's, it's responsible for the
 feelings of satisfaction.
 It also releases oxytocin.
 Oxytocin, am I saying that right?
 That's accompanied with a warm fuzzy feelings.
 So what I was going to say, so you can like boost those.
 Anytime you want to be kind, but then you might be nullifying the reasons
 why you're being kind.
 Does that makes it your then being like, I think sometimes we wait
 until we have like a motivation to be kind
 that's more like an internal motivation
 that makes us do something external.
 But it seems like from that study,
 they're actually just choosing.
 I'm choosing, I'm going to be kind
 and they're still reaping the benefits
 of what kindness brings.
  </li><li>Well, I was thinking about that verse that says
 about, you know,
 Closhing 3, verse 12,
 "Therefore as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved,
 "clothed yourself with compassion,
 Kindness humility gentleness and patience like I clove myself in this shirt today
 It didn't just I didn't you know feel like I didn't wake up with it on me
 I deliberately put it on me and we can deliberately choose to be kind
 It feels like you're waiting to make some comment of my shirt go on
 I know you definitely did not wake up with that shirt on
 No, because you like to like walk around naked and then traumatize the girls in the morning by saying it's shirtless
  </li><li>No, no, no, no, no.
  </li><li>Correct there. - No, no, no.
  </li><li>All right, fine, you're wearing pants,
 but you don't have a shirt on,
 and then you come out and you dance.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>I do. - Do you deny it?
  </li><li>No, I don't deny that.
 I do like to traumatize my teenage children
 with shirtless Wednesday.
  </li><li>Shirtless Wednesday. - Where I wake up.
  </li><li>Shirtless Thursday, shirtless Friday.
  </li><li>And Jay loves it, of course.
  </li><li>Oh, yes. - Yeah.
  </li><li>It's the best as far as he's concerned.
  </li><li>As far as he's concerned.
  </li><li>He'll dance with you.
  </li><li>What were we talking about?
  </li><li>Clothing ourselves with kindness.
  </li><li>What kindness?
 I was thinking about, oh, no, no, no.
 You know how we were talking about science?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Right, you know, serotonin and oxytocin
 and all that sort of stuff.
  </li><li>Oh, like it's stuff.
  </li><li>Right, and it took a study.
 You didn't need to, you just need
 to read Proverbs 16, verse 24.
 Listen to this.
  </li><li>Read it to me.
  </li><li>Kind words are like honey.
 Sweet to the soul and healthy for the body.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>When you show kindness, I guess,
 through kind words in this one,
 it's sweet to your soul and it's healthy for your body.
 Like I was literally floating with, you know, satisfaction.
 Matt came to help and floating around with like just deep,
 I was deeply moved by the kindness
 that people showed my kids.
  </li><li>Yeah, so like physiologically,
 we're built to respond to kindness.
  </li><li>Then I was thinking about,
 it's the message, isn't it?
 It says generosity begets generosity.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Well, I was thinking about generosity,
 I was thinking about kindness begets, kindness.
  </li><li>Well, you reap what you sow.
 Well, you do report you so, but I was reading 1 Chronicles 19, verse 2.
 And David says, "David thought I will show kindness to Hannah and son of
 hat and a hash because his father showed kindness to me."
 Yeah.
 And I was thinking about, "Oh, I've received all this kindness or I've watched
 he receive all this kindness from friends and family.
 And I'm curious if that prompted my heart to be kind to others too."
 Like kindness becomes kindness.
 And then I thought about the, was it you and I,
 or was it M&amp;A, I forget how this happened,
 but somebody started a train going through Starbucks
 where we paid for the car behind us.
 That's what it was, didn't we?
 We came through this, and the barista was somebody at M&amp;A.
 And we came through and we said,
 we'd like to pay for our order and for the car behind us.
 And that started an unbroken trail for many cars.
  </li><li>17 cars.
  </li><li>Where they all paid for the car behind them.
 And I was like, that's an example.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's just like rolling on.
 I love it.
 So when we were talking about doing kindness again,
 I've been in the fruit, spirit,
 and just preparing a message actually today.
 But I came across this first in the process
 and it's Ephesians 4 verse 32.
 This is from the ESV.
 It says, "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted,
 forgiving one another as God in Christ forgave you."
 So kindness really goes hand in hand
 with a bunch of other things like gentleness, like forgiveness.
 Like, but again, it's all choice.
 It's all choice oriented.
 But I think the benefits far outweigh any discomfort
 or effort.
  </li><li>Or cost.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause it always costs you something to be kind.
  </li><li>Yeah, well, yes.
 I was also thinking about how kindness only works
 if it's freely given.
 Like if I try and leverage kindness from you.
  </li><li>If I'm like you, go over there and be kind.
  </li><li>Yeah, but like I think about like if you had it
 in your heart to be kind to me and give me $100,
 let's just say that it was your heart.
 Like I really wanna bless Alan with $100.
 And you gave me that $100, I'd be blessed, you'd be blessed.
 Let's say I don't know you're planning on doing that
 and see that you have $100 ready to give me.
 Don't know what's coming to me and I steal that.
 or I manipulate you or I drag you out with you.
  </li><li>Oh, you're like, hey, I see you have $100 over there.
  </li><li>Yeah, sure would be nice, you know, blah, blah, blah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like, I still end up with $100,
 but I'm robbed of something else.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I think it's so important that we understand
 kindness can only be given, it can't be taken.
 And I think to, I was thinking about,
 I was thinking about the culture I grew up in,
 like in my immediate household,
 and the kindness I watch my mom and my dad display continually.
 And I also remember their efforts to try and get me to show
 kindness, which by the way, it's good parenting.
 Like they're trying to get me to,
 but somehow I missed out on the lessons we're trying to teach
 you because it probably felt like coercion to be kind.
 They're trying to produce a behavior,
 not realizing that it's actually a heart motivate.
  </li><li>Well, yeah, you need to have the value
 before you're gonna have the behavior.
  </li><li>Right, but I wonder if so much of why kindness impacted me
 in the last couple of months is it just reminded me
 so much of the environment I grew up
 and where my mom was so kind and gracious.
 Like I remember, you know, whatever you grew up
 with is just normal, and so you have comparison?
 I don't remember a Sunday of my entire life
 when we didn't have people who weren't my family
 in my house for lunch and dinner.
 Like every Sunday, lunch and dinner,
 my mom would have all of us have people back from church.
 If there's newcomers, they were back,
 if there were students.
 Like I remember going to university,
 banking on me being taken care of,
 because that's why I witnessed my mom doing it.
 Right enough I did.
 I went to church where the people in our church
 literally had a ministry to university students
 where there would be a rotor of who was hosting
 student lunches, and we'd all go back to people's houses.
 I still remember the kindness of those people.
 So anyway, I always--
  </li><li>Well, I think that's interesting
 'cause just in practically thinking about that,
 that means that your parents,
 both planned and budgeted for kindness.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Like every week.
  </li><li>Yep.
 It was never, ever, ever a big ask
 to ask my parents if my friends could stay for dinner.
 Never, never.
 My mom would always be like, yeah, of course.
 I remember some of my friends getting saved
 because of the kindness of my mom and dad.
 that there was all of Ruma R dining room table
 for my friends to eat.
 And like now that I'm a parent with three kids
 and I know the pace of life that we live at,
 like it would require some flex,
 you know, of course you didn't want to deny it,
 but you're right, yeah, it didn't ever factor that.
 That my mom and dad actively planned and prepared.
 And think about that,
 my mom would cook a meal not knowing
 how many people would be there.
  </li><li>I mean, as a shaper, that just blows my mind.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 It makes me think about what if we started a week of kindness?
 So everybody who's listening to this, what if we all
 purposed in our heart to exercise five acts of kindness this week?
 I don't know when you're going to listen to this episode.
 They come out on Mondays, but I don't know if it was a month.
 Yeah, we're going to have a week from whatever you listen to.
 But what if in the next five days, as you're listening to this,
 you purpose in your heart that you're going to display kindness.
 And the thing I love about kindness is there's so much of God wrapped up in kindness.
 There's gentleness is wrapped up in kindness.
 There's compassion is wrapped up in kindness.
 There's forgiveness.
 Like one of the boldest things you can do is show kindness to somebody who's hurt you.
 Like that's what Jesus does all the time.
 Like it's kindness that he constantly extends forgiveness to us.
 You know that whole thing about like weeping burning.
 that leads us to repentance.
  </li><li>It is.
 So here's my challenge.
 And I don't know of a creative way of asking to share in this.
 I don't know whether we need like a kindness hashtag
 or something that you can--
  </li><li>Ooh, that's a good idea.
  </li><li>Yeah, I just wanna hear.
  </li><li>Just come up with one creatively.
 You sing these weird songs to the kids all the time,
 like on the fly, you just come up with stuff.
 So I'm gonna say hashtag and you're gonna say
 whatever the hashtag will be.
 You ready? - Yeah.
  </li><li>Okay.
 Hashtag. - Potato monkey.
  </li><li>I don't think that's gonna work.
 something with the word maybe kindness in it, ready?
  </li><li>No, no, no, no, I feel so much pressure.
  </li><li>Hashtag potato monkey kindness.
  </li><li>I don't know, it'd just be great to on social media
 see people talking about kindness.
 And their kindness challenge,
 or if they were a stick in their kindness.
  </li><li>Kindness challenge, hashtag kindness challenge.
  </li><li>Isn't that a really long hashtag?
 We're gonna have a hashtag expert.
  </li><li>No, it's fine.
  </li><li>All right, kindness, hashtag all one word kindness challenge.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>It's about the same length as potato monkey.
  </li><li>Or potato monkey.
 You may hashtag either.
  </li><li>I would love us.
 I don't even want to give definition
 of what it means to be kind,
 but whether that's, you know, let's do something
 for a week where we do five acts of kindness
 and then let us know about how it goes on Facebook,
 on Instagram, social media,
 or you can either privately,
 let the here test moves that we can read out.
  </li><li>So good.
  </li><li>Any thoughts?
  </li><li>No, I don't have any thoughts.
 I mean, other than what we've shared, of course.
  </li><li>Do you have any other thoughts?
 You look secretive. - No.
  </li><li>Put your glasses on the end, you know.
  </li><li>On the end of my nose.
  </li><li>Yeah, and then look at me.
 I'll have the glasses on the back.
 You have no return to your library books.
 You have bad volume.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Okay, you have issues.
 We need to just wrap this thing up.
  </li><li>No, I've got listeners question for you.
  </li><li>Oh, a listeners question.
  </li><li>We're going from kindness.
  </li><li>It's for me.
  </li><li>Oh yeah. - Or for like both of us.
  </li><li>No, it's definitely for you.
  </li><li>Oh dear.
 question all about Halloween. Okay, then. Okay. I can use their name on air. I like
 what I can do. This is from Jill. Jill asks, "Hi, Alan and AJ. My husband and I listened
 to AJ's Halloween teaching two years ago and decided we didn't want to celebrate the
 holiday as a family." Yes. If you don't know what we're talking about, I'll put a link
 in the show notes to our Halloween message. I just remember it's got some funny content
 there. Sexy ween. Okay, Halloween. Our son was almost three at the time and we'd never
 done a lot, but had carved pumpkins, dressed them up, not taking them trick or treating
 as he was still super young. Usually attended a party hosted by our friends. We weren't
 super into it, but still wanted to make a conscious choice not to do these things.
 Well our son is now almost five and very much aware of Halloween and I'm wondering if there
 are resources or how you talk to your kids about it. He's talking about how much he
 quote unquote loves Halloween and I'm over here trying to explain, "No, we don't and
 it's not a good thing to celebrate." I know kids say things and I'm sure a little bit
 of it. He's disappointed not to get to participate with his friends and they don't always know
 what they're saying but I'm just curious if you have any talking points for your kids.
 Thank you.
 Gosh. Well, I mean, we've sort of just, Jill, it sounds like you're, you know, doing everything
 right in terms of having the conversation. I mean, we, when we've talked to our kids
 about it, we have just said, "Hey, this is a holiday that celebrates darkness, you know,
 and that's not what we want to do." And so, we usually plan alternative things that make
 it feel like they're not, you know, missing out. But we do explain, "Hey, this isn't something
 that we as Christians want to be participating in.
 And then typically we do stuff like we tend to go out for dinner on holiday.
 So we make it like a, hey, it's a family dinner out to someplace they want to go.
 Sometimes we've turned off all the lights and watched a movie inside the house just
 to, you know, just to have like a little family time.
 Or to avoid a trick and treat air.
 Yeah.
 Sorry we don't celebrate that here.
 Yeah.
 Like we don't have to do that.
 Yeah.
 outside so that they're sort of aware of that. And you know, I typically buy a couple of bags of
 candy, you know, that they get to share. That came out of the conversation of when they similar
 sort of conversations as you're having, Jill, where they, and we've refined the message over the
 years as they've grown. But one year, we said, what is it that you're sad about not being able to,
 like, they would be like, I know it's not right to celebrate Halloween, but I'm still kind of bummed
 that we don't get to celebrate.
 And so you at the genius--
  </li><li>That's right, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, you were like, oh, talk to me about that.
 Like what is the bit you're missing most?
 And it came down to candy.
 So you were like--
  </li><li>Salt.
  </li><li>So all your feelings about this will go away
 if you get to pick candy.
 And I think you literally said,
 oh, do you wanna go get some candy?
 Yeah.
  </li><li>We all went out, they each picked one of,
 like one of those Halloween sized bags
 of whichever treat they wanted.
 We brought it home, shoved it in a bucket, problem solved.
  </li><li>And the whole thing with, you know,
 revisiting the messaging is good because, you know, AJ, your description of like what we've told them like he's going to do with
 Darnis somehow translated to MJ's years when he was a little boy was we don't celebrate Halloween because it's Satan's birthday.
 And we were like, yeah, we'll clean that up next year. Okay, in your head, that's working and we don't want to celebrate Satan's birthday.
 Yeah.
 So it sounds like you're doing a great, a great, a great job. And we've been careful not to.
 to vilify, you know, some of the other things that we've drawn conclusions with,
 because we told Star Tower kids about this really, really young.
 We also, just because we love killing every celebration,
 we also told them that Santa Claus wasn't real from birth.
  </li><li>Yeah, we never maintained that. - But we helped them understand that, you know,
 what some kids, some of their parents say,
 "Love to lie to their children."
 I didn't say that, but...
  </li><li>Oh my gosh, that's horrible. - Some kids love to think that Santa Claus is real
 and we don't want to spoil that for them. So you know the sense is not real, but you don't tell other
 people. And so we've, you know, we've tried to help them understand that as Christians, there's,
 we have a different value system from the world and that's okay. And we've tried to
 not make that like a moral high ground or anything, but just a reality that there's a difference for
 Christians and people who don't know the Jesus, people who don't know the Jesus, and that's going
 going to have an effect on your life. And so we've pointed those things out about like,
 you know, why do we go to church on Sunday and some of my friends don't? And why do we not
 celebrate Halloween? And why do we, you know, celebrate Christmas this way? And we have had to
 refine that conversation, particularly with Halloween, because I mean, I've had friends,
 like I've had Abby and Tia both ask like, well, I have friends who are Christians who celebrate
 Halloween. So what do I do with that kind of thing? Well, they're not real. Just kidding. I'm
 kidding.
 So bad.
 But I always just say to Abby, like when she's brought it up, I'm like, Darlin, I have
 to believe that if they knew what it was actually about, they wouldn't choose to celebrate
 it either.
 But because everything is so commercialized, most think people think it's about orange
 and black.
 It's about, you know, it's about pumpkin spice lattes.
 about carving pumpkins and they're not actually associating with its roots, what it's actually
 about, what it's still about today.
 And it's mostly just due to ignorance.
 It's not that they're going, "I don't care that it celebrates Satan.
 I want to do this."
 Anyway, it's that they don't actually realize what it actually is.
 Yeah.
 It sounds like you're doing great, Jill.
 I mean, I'm sorry we don't have better resources.
 Adrian, maybe you could write a book on Halloween.
 I don't want to write a book on that.
 Halloween forgets.
 I'm kidding.
 I'm kidding.
 Yeah.
 Good.
