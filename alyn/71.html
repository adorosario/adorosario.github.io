  <li>Oh yeah.
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses, sharing their life experiences.
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses.
 They talk about faith in God and everything under the sun.
 If you are a human being, there's something here for everyone.
 Mrs. AJ Jones.
 Most of your Jones.
 Why are you so beautiful, Ty?
 Um...
 Well, gosh, I have no idea.
 And maybe it was my afternoon nap.
 It beautifies.
 You'd love your Sunday afternoon, Naps.
 I do. Even if it's like 20 minutes, it's worth it to me.
 It's worth it to me too, because during that time, I can play Nintendo.
 Yes, uninterrupted.
 Uninterrupted.
 Welcome, everybody, to episode 71 of Keeping Up With Joneses.
 Welcome!
 Tell me about this week, baby.
 It was a good week.
 This past week on the school, we talked on healing life's hurts.
 What's that about?
 It's about healing life's hurts.
 Yes.
 Give me an example.
 Things like art of stone, inner vows, ungodly beliefs, deliverance, all that kind of good stuff.
 So basically stuff that's hurt us that we've managed to cope with.
 Yes.
 and what mechanisms that we've employed to help us cope, but actually are robbing life from us.
 So it's not only ministering into the pains, but trying to dismantle the structured reviews to
 keep pain out. Yes, that are usually keeping people out and God out as well.
 Right. That was fun. It was really good. That week should be sponsored by Kleenex at the school.
 It really should. I always feel a bit bad for the students when they look all eager,
 died and happy. And I think you have no idea what's coming.
 I like the fact that we end with deliverance and none of the students know,
 except for everybody who's listening to this podcast that's coming to school next year.
 Nothing.
 Yeah, we'll just pray the Holy Spirit helps them forget.
 But the way we do deliverance is super easy.
 Yes, I'm super non-traumatic.
 Yes, we don't have any snarling or gnashing of tea, 30 nonsense.
 Right.
 Yes.
 I remember when it was deliverance, we got my school
 and I had the same level of anxiety.
 I'm sure that some of our students did.
 I was like, what's going to happen?
 But it was completely uneventful.
 Yeah.
 My dad arrived this week.
 He did.
 From Scotland.
 From Scotland.
 And he brought his weather with him.
 Although he claims that it was really nice in Scotland.
 Well, in which case, Tennessee sent their weather to Scotland and Scotland sent their
 weather to Tennessee.
 Right, because since the day he's arrived, it's been miserable.
 And rainy and drizzly.
 But it did get sunny today around five.
 And apparently it's super sunny tomorrow.
 Yay.
 And it's funny because our kids are all over Grandpa.
 And what I love about my dad is he's quite like me
 or I'm quite like him.
 And that he's also about to say I'm low maintenance.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Which is not true at all.
 We'll be darling, but you're pretty far from low maintenance.
  </li><li>I'm-- - Can you give me some water?
 Hey, can you pass me that thing over there?
 Hey, do you know that I'm sitting down too?
 Yeah, but you know, it's closer for you.
 Are you kidding me?
  </li><li>Could I get word in that,
 what I mean is under the right circumstances,
 I'm low maintenance with circumstances when you're sleeping.
 Okay, this conversation is not going the way I wanted to.
 Your father is low maintenance.
 What I mean by that is he's completely content to just sit down and read a book.
 All day.
 Yeah.
 And he can feed him anything.
 Yeah.
 It's brilliant.
 Yeah.
 But Saturday we realized it was the only day he had for the kids because the kids were
 at school.
 So we're like, what can we do on a rainy day in Tennessee that doesn't involve a
 striving of Chattanooga?
 And then we realized hey there's an aquarium restaurant.
 Yes, at the opera mouth.
 So we drove there and the kids loved it.
 They did. There's only one shark though.
 Yeah, and we ate it.
 I thought it was cute that Tia, our six year old, the server came over
 and he's like, do you serve sushi?
 Because you took her for sushi like a week or two ago and now she's decided.
 Well, she's decided she doesn't like sushi, but she likes ordering sushi.
 And she likes watching sushi being made so she does like salmon.
 Yeah she asked for salmon and they didn't have anything in a child portion and i wasn't going to pay twenty one dollars for salmon so.
 She did it is this is salmon but look it's uniform salmon and breadcrumbs.
 You spoke this morning i did on.
 Wait for it. Yes. What do I speak on, baby? You spoke on wonder, but you spoke on cynicism.
 I just spoke on cynicism robbing you of wonder. I did. You were listening. That's amazing. I
 listened to both services. You're very, very good. In fact, I tried to tweet something that you said,
 I wish I could remember it. It was about the atmosphere of heaven and that cynicism doesn't
 exist in the atmosphere of heaven. I can't remember. You said something that was just like, oh my gosh,
 That's brilliant and I tried to sign into tweet it
 But because this is a new phone. I didn't have tweet box set up and by the time I got it set up
 I had forgotten what you said
 You are adorable. Thanks. I look after you in your old days. Don't worry. Thank you to know what you said
 Though do you know what quote? I'm talking no idea. Okay. I'll look after you two in your old age
 Apparently not because when I asked you gave me water at the end of the world
 I think the biggest news of this week has to be the jingle news tingle news now for those of you who are joining us two weeks ago a j announced.
 A completely undiscussed her desire for a jingle which is a bit of a problem for me cuz I don't really like jingles live wanted to jingle for seventy episodes and you know what you can be very brave thank you and you know you haven't even tried to make your own jingle.
 I did to i know i've been for the ditch that it only played on one show so you start a jingle competition yes how many entries did we get to said jingle competition i was expecting at least ten.
 I did you get to why does that not bother us they're both amazing they are both astonishing yes can i talk about.
 My when you eat your with me my wednesday okay i say well and then they sounded a bit like that okay i talk about my wednesday yes.
 So, A.G. and I are meeting Danielle Helson, one of the people we work with and we're having a meeting
 and we're eating, we're eating, yeah, we were, we're eating a restaurant.
  </li><li>It's tacos. - I get a tweet from a friend of mine, Will,
 Will Law, who has moved from England to Tennessee to do this school.
  </li><li>Yeah. - And he's quickly become a friend of ours.
 And he tweets when he says, "Hey, here is Jonathan Mann's entry to your jingle competition."
 Now for those of you who don't know who Jonathan man is let me back up a little bit i didn't know who he was but i knew who was because.
 Jonathan man some of you might know me as the song a day man on youtube this guy has been writing a song everyday since.
 January first two thousand nine.
 That's impressive everyday new song uploads to youtube that's as long as we live in Tennessee wow yeah good night.
 So he's a pretty good songwriter. The reason i knew of him was he wrote a song remember the
 iPhone 4 came out and there was an antenna problem. Yes there really wasn't a problem he wrote a
 song about that and apple famously played his song at press conference so that's the first time i
 ever heard about Jonathan Mann and then from time to time i'd you know see the stuff he's done he's
 a very clever man he's a brilliant writer he's a creative genius and so anyway i know who he is
 the other reason i know who he is is i listened to another podcast each week called
 accidental tech podcast. It's a technology podcast mostly about Apple stuff.
 And you know it because you hear me listen to it. And Jonathan Mann wrote the jingle for that song.
 So it's very catchy. Very catchy because he's a brilliant songwriter.
 So I listen to, you know, this podcast every week, I hear this jingle. It turns out Will
 listens to the same podcast. So we kind of bonded over our love of tech podcast.
 That's a real shocker there. Yep. So Jonathan Mann is a big deal. Like, you know, I've known
 who he is. So when I see Will mention him, his Twitter name, I'm like, is this a joke? Like,
 does Will know Jonathan? What? Is this one big massive disappointment? Is it a cruel joke?
 And at the back of my head, I'm thinking, oh my gosh, what if Jonathan Man's actually written
 a jingle for our podcast? Because truth be told, when you said I want a jingle for the podcast,
 I was like, I only want a jingle for the podcast of it's by Jonathan Man because I love the
 accidental tech podcast jingle because it's super catchy.
 Okay.
 So we're at the restaurant.
 We're in the middle of a meeting.
 I'm trying to honor the people I'm meeting with,
 but I have this tweet burning a hole in my iPhone.
 And so I'm trying to start to seriously click on it.
 And what do you know? It's a link to Dropbox.
 I click on it and here is Jonathan Mann singing
 about our podcast and boy, did he nail it.
 Yeah, really good jingle.
 Here's the problem.
 We're often asked, what's your podcast about?
 And we can't summarize it.
 But this guy not only summarized it, he made it rhyme and he put it to music.
 So I said, then, yeah, would you excuse me?
 I have to play this.
 So I just was the obnoxious person in the middle of a restaurant playing a
 song from their iPhone to the point where the tables run to turn around to see what
 was going on.
 And I was in shock.
 I was in shock.
 I was in shock.
 I was giddy like a school girl on a bag of crack.
 I was unbelievably high.
 It was amazing.
 Like, so here's this person who's worked.
 I've admired for a long time.
 You know, I anyway, I was just like, what?
 is going on. So I got to listen to it once. Left that meeting went straight into another
 meeting. And the person we're having meeting with Michelle is like, do you have headphones
 on you? And she's like, yeah, I need to listen to this. So listen to it over and over and
 over again. And I hope you agree. Jonathan did an incredible job on that.

 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; If you are a human being &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; There's something here for everyone &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 It's a fantastic jingle.
 And then there's Jesse's jingle,
 which I can't get the little tune out of my head.
 I've been singing it in my head for days.
  </li><li>So our Jesse, as we like to call her,
 our Tia calls her my Jesse,
 is one of our worship leaders at Grey Center
 and she's got the voice of an angel,
 we love her to pieces,
 but she's also an incredibly talented songwriter.
 So she said, "Hey, I'm gonna write you a jingle."
 And bless her, she did write a jingle
 and just as the deadline was approaching,
 she uploaded a jingle to SoundCloud, we downloaded it.
 And again, it's amazing.
 (upbeat music)

 So here's our dilemma. We've got two amazing jingles. We do. What are we going to do about it? Look at my sad eyes.
 Oh, it's such a hard decision. I think what we do is because you're so excited about the song "A Day Guy" doing the jingle that we do his jingle, but we thank Jesse profusely for writing us such a wonderful jingle.
 And then maybe we can stick it in here and there as a surprise like, they played the
 other jingle kind of scenario.
 Look at you.
 You're just a great problem solver.
 You're so full of wisdom.
 All right.
 This week, we were teaching at school about a whole host of inner healing topics.
 And one of the things that we both love to teach on, and we both often fight about who
 gets to teach on.
 Yeah, we often do.
 But this year, I got it.
 You did.
 And it's the topic of ungodly beliefs.
 Yes. Tell us what an ungodly belief is, AJ Jones.
 An ungodly belief is something that appears to be absolutely true based on the facts of
 your experience, but is absolutely false based on God's word.
 That's a very good definition, but what is it?
 Well it's a lie that you believe because of things that you've been through that is robbing
 life from you.
 Give me some examples.
 So well, if you grew up in a house where maybe nobody noticed you, maybe it was a big family
 or a dysfunctional home or something, and you just sort of came away with the feeling that
 you're invisible or you don't count.
 Later on in life, as life plays out, every time something happens that could possibly
 feed that light does because they're going to make sure that your that light gets fed.
 So you mean you're overlooked for an invitation to a party or something?
 Right.
 Instead of being, you know, you being able to go, "Oh, you know, there's a million people,
 of course, they, you know what I mean?"
 It's the, "Oh, yeah, that's because I'm invisible and I don't count."
 It adds to your line.
 And it's funny because they don't sound so blatant in your head, do they?
 It's like a running track.
 people call it ants, automatic negative thoughts. It's just this well-rehearsed belief system
 rather than something you're like, "I'm not going to choose to believe this." But you believe,
 "Well, yeah, I'm not as popular as other people." Well, they sound true because they're based on
 your experience. Right. And based on your experience, you could sit down and go, "This was the time I
 was rejected. This is the time people thought I was invisible." And you can point at it. But the
 trouble is when you line up what you believe with what Scripture says about you, there's often a
 huge discrepancy. Right. So you have a God that will never leave you or forsake you. You have a
 God who's numbered the hairs on your head. You have a God who has loved you with an everlasting
 love. And so you read things like that, but there's no bucket to put it in. Right. Because that lie
 is so powerful because of your experience, but it's at war with the truth of God's word. And so
 we love the teaching because it's dismantling those lies, which enables you then to live and
 operate out of the truth of who God is and who He says you are and who He is to you as opposed to
 the truth of what your experience has been. Talk to me about your dad because your dad,
 I love this example, it's quite a powerful, ungodly belief that to us on the outside looks
 ridiculous but to him who believed it all his life, there was nothing ridiculous about it.
 So my dad grew up in a dysfunctional home. His dad was lovely but had fought in both wars and
 and was just kind of shut down and stuff.
 And his mom was quite aggressive and, well, kind of mean.
 And so she would tell him all the time that he was stupid.
 From the time he was really little,
 she'd just be like, "Teddy, you're stupid."
  </li><li>His repetition through his childhood.
  </li><li>You're so stupid.
 And they got, my dad was anything but stupid.
 He has three degrees from university.
 So he had a history degree, an engineering degree,
 and an architectural degree.
 And he read the Encyclopedia for fun.
  </li><li>Did he just spend his 20s in higher education facilities?
  </li><li>Yes.
 And all of it graduating the very top of his class
 and full rights scholarship
 because his family had no money.
  </li><li>No, not stupid then.
  </li><li>Not stupid.
 Just excelled at anything he put his mind to.
 Just really, really smart.
 And then they had him tested at one point.
 And I can't remember if he was 156 or 166,
 but he's well into genius.
 But his whole life until he died, he believed he was stupid because his mother had said
 it to him over and over and over again as a child.
 And he would find corresponding events in his life to reinforce that belief that would
 override, but hey, Teddy, you have three degrees, like you're an independent architect.
 You're obviously a very intelligent man.
 He would in his own life be able to point to, well, yeah, but I'm stupid because of this
 and this and this and this.
 Right.
 that he could find and it wouldn't even necessarily be a mistake in regards to intelligence.
 But like when everything fell apart with the family and God started restoring my relationship
 with him, I remember him just he would beat himself up so badly like, "Oh, so stupid."
 And blah, blah, blah.
 You know, so I get that he wished that things could have been different, but that lie was
 so ingrained in him that he constantly believed he was stupid.
 And so we've used some fairly simple ungodly beliefs there and the interesting thing about ungodly beliefs is they appear completely
 Ridiculous to everybody on the outside for example anorexia is a great example of an ungodly belief at work
 Right you've got somebody who is
 Unhealthily thin yeah to any outside
 Medical practitioner or just the general public looking at somebody who's in advanced ages of anorexia
 I mean this person is skin and bones, but to them they're in a mirror. I'm just fat. I'm obese. I'm hideous. I'm disgusting
 And that's an extreme example, but we have all of us have ungodly beliefs somewhere
 nestled in our life for years.
 Yeah.
 And you get them from different experiences.
 And we think of them as normal.
 And the tricky part is finding them.
 Yeah.
 I mean, I remember one of my big ones when I first heard this teaching was about, I had
 an ungodly belief that if I love someone, they'll leave.
 Now I had experience to back that up.
 I had experience with my dad.
 I had experience with my first husband.
 So I had experience that if you love someone, they leave.
 But the Lord was trying to get close to me
 and I couldn't even let him get close to me
 because it defiles everyone.
 It's that tape that plays.
 And so the Lord was saying to me,
 I want to bring restoration in your life,
 but I can't because you're not going to let anybody close
 because you're believing this lie more than you're believing in my goodness, more than
 you're believing in my ability to heal you, you know, to restore you, to set you free.
 And so I remember the day that I was sitting there working on that lie and even, you know,
 you're supposed to write out the Godly belief and I was so convinced of the lie, I couldn't
 hear the Godly belief.
 So I actually had to turn to some friends for help.
 know, can you help me hear the truth of what God has to say?
 These are similar common godly beliefs we've found while ministering to people.
 So it's unlikely that the ones we're going to read out are going to sound exactly like
 what you believe, but it's likely that at some level and somewhere you've believed
 something similar.
 So for example, I don't belong, I'll always be on the outside.
 my feelings don't count or no one will love me just for me being me. How about this one? I've
 messed up so badly that I've missed God's best for me. If you believe that at some level,
 you'll continue messing up so badly to prove that you've missed God's best for you.
 But imagine what it would be like if you got rid of that and believed that God is the God that
 repays the years locust of Eden. Yeah, and you may not even continue to mess up badly. You may
 may just live a mediocre life, never actually seeing his best because you think you don't
 deserve it.
 What about this one?
 I'll never get credit for what I do.
 Yeah.
 Should we talk about our great and godly belief in our marriage?
 Yes.
 So when Agee and I went away for a week of ministry with Chester and Betsy Killsdrough,
 our dear friends, they listened to you speak for a week and they said, "Hey, here you're
 on godly beliefs."
 And I had an ungodly belief that Agee will never give me credit for anything I'm doing
 at home.
 She doesn't actually do anything anyway.
 And what she does do is just woman's work.
 Now, I was hugely offended that he would suggest
 that I actually believe something so misogynistic,
 something so sexist, so something absolutely appalling.
 And so I fought him and said, I don't believe that.
 Well, you behave as if it's true.
 And I actually had to take a step back and go,
 cerebrally, I don't believe that
 ages doing woman's work, quote unquote.
 And that somehow that's menial.
 but I couldn't argue with the fruit
 that when Ajay would point out that,
 hey, honey, when you say I haven't done anything
 but I've done this, this and this,
 somehow I was excusing her from doing anything
 real and substantial.
 So as you might imagine that brought
 tremendous blessing into our marriage.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>And you had none, godly belief, that sounded like what?
  </li><li>Well, I mean, I had a couple that all fed the same thing,
 I think, but I had one that was,
 I'll never get any credit for what I do.
 doesn't see what I do. He only sees what he does. So imagine two people in a marriage with both
 those ungodly beliefs fueling their self-righteousness, keeping scores of what the other person's doing.
 That was a recipe for huge amounts of friction in our marriage. But then you get to deal with
 your ungodly belief by replacing it with a godly belief. Talk to me about how you get rid of
 I'm Godly belief. Well, I mean, after you've identified them, you pray through breaking agreement
 with them and you ask the Lord to give you the Godly belief that's the counter for that.
 So step one is you just confess that you've been believing a lie. Yes.
 Like, Lord, would you forgive me for believing the lie that my wife doesn't do anything that
 actually counts? Yeah. And then you extend forgiveness to anybody who taught you to even think that way.
 Yeah. So I think about people in my life who would have taught me what is woman to work and what
 isn't, what does have value, what doesn't. And I'm realizing, ah, I didn't come to that conclusion
 on my own. So I forgive anybody involved to talk me to think that way. And then you renounce and
 break agreement with a lie. Yeah. And you say the whole lie out, like you renounce and break
 agreement with a lie that what age is doing doesn't count. And it's just woman to work. Yeah.
 And then and then you ask the Lord for the godly belief.
 So what does that look like? Well, sometimes it's, you know, sometimes it's usually a mix of
 scripture verses and just truth, like listening to the Lord and him saying, you know, here's the
 truth of the counters that lie. Right. And usually, often you need help finding it because you've
 believe that life for so long that it seems like, well, I couldn't find the truth if it hit me in
 the face, you know. Right. And even when you do find the truth, and the truth to that statement is,
 it is my pleasure to love AJ as Christ loves the church. And my job is not actually to keep score
 of what she's doing but to lay down my life for her. So that's a very effective Godly belief in
 nullifying the old one. But when you say that, you're like, I'm not sure I even believe that.
 which is why you repeat the godly belief for 30 days.
 So you're doing this exercise where you've got a list of these godly beliefs
 that you're trying to because Romans 12 says that we're transformed by the
 renewing of our mind.
 Yeah.
 So we have these list of godly beliefs that we just declare until we actually
 believe it.
 Yeah.
 And then we keep declaring until we feel like it's true.
 Yeah.
 Only for us, like usually when you do your healing, you're healing week.
 They tell you to say it every morning for 30 days, you know, because you're
 trying to get it into your head.
 And then we realized that we needed a bit more than 30 days because like two days
 after the 30 days were at, you know, we were doing so well.
 We were doing so well.
 And then we snapped.
 Then we snapped and started like getting mad at each other in the car.
 Yeah.
 Well, you're always on your laptop.
 Yeah.
 Well, you don't do it anyway.
 And then we were like, Oh, this sounds like a run.
 Godly.
 Oh, no.
 So we both were like, OK, read your godly beliefs.
 And so we did it for another two months.
 Right.
 Just to like, OK.
 90 days. Let's let 90 days help us.
 But you'll hear ungodly beliefs in everybody's life. I'm not an artist. I'm not creative.
 I'm not musical. I'm not prophetic.
 I'm not beautiful.
 I'm not good mom.
 Yeah.
 And the ones that we express are the easy ones to find, especially if you're in a community
 in a culture that understands these because you can snitch on each other.
 The ones you never express and just think about, they're much harder to find.
 And God is so good to uproot those.
 Yeah, it is fun being in relationship with people though, that you that will call you on
 stuff and that you've given permission to call you on stuff.
 Because maybe if, well, I suppose if you don't want to deal with your stuff, it doesn't,
 that wouldn't be very fun.
 But I just love having people around like Sarah Parsons or Shannon or whoever that will
 go, Hey, that's a lie.
 Right.
 You know, when it comes out of your face and you go, Oh, right.
 Sarah is like a sniper at ungodly statements that come out of your face.
 She's like, your words are verbal contract.
 Your words have power.
 God bless their persons.
 You know who else we need to bless?
 Lyle and Alison Phillips, a star of the podcast.
 Yes, they have.
 And they're up to like episode three or four already.
 Wow.
 Way to go guys.
 Overachievers right there.
 They are amazing.
 If you haven't heard their podcast, we'll put a link to them in their show notes.
 They're doing a great job.
 Super want to encourage them as they start into this podcasting lark.
 AJ, we've got some listeners questions for you.
 We do.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 You're going to love this question.
 Alan, AJ, this is from Ella.
 You guys are both brilliant and I love being able to listen to your podcast at work.
 Thank you.
 My question is about raising kids as spirit-filled parents.
 I was raised in a Calvinistic environment where the Bible was really the third
 member of the Trinity rather than the Holy Spirit.
 I have heard you guys talk about how your little ones hang out with Jesus before bedtime
 or how they sing in tongues.
 That gives me so much hope for my future and my future kids.
 What is it like to be parents who have a very real relationship with the Holy Spirit?
 And how does that affect your kids and your relationship with them?
 Also, if you have any cool or funny stories about your kiddos and the supernatural, I
 would love to hear them.
 Thank you.
 What is it like?
 Well, I suppose we don't know what it's like to not be that way, like on one level.
 So I think we're just trying to be ourselves and have the relationship that we have with
 the Holy Spirit in front of our kids.
 And thankfully we go to a church that the kids are learning about the Holy Spirit and
 stuff like that too.
 So they ask tons of questions.
 Right.
 And they're super hungry and we just try not to shut them down.
 And I think it would probably be very, very prudent for us right at the beginning to say
 In no way do we think that we are incredible parents
 who are flowing in the Holy Spirit.
 I think most days we're thinking
 we're doing the best we can with what we have.
  </li><li>We just need to make it to seven until we go to bed.
  </li><li>So I would hate for us to put ourselves out there,
 some sort of benchmark to emulate that,
 that would be sheer folly.
 We do have an amazing church
 and we do have amazing children's pastors
 and we are very, very blessed to have hungry kids.
 And we live in a culture and a community that fosters all of this stuff.
 So I think the big thing for me, Ella, was I remember when our first daughter was born Abigail.
 And at the time we lived with John and Carol Arnett, who are really great revivalists.
 And I thought of the kindness of God really toward me, that my kids would grow up with
 grandparents/spiritual grandparents who've led a revival.
 Yeah.
 And I thought like when I got really hungry for the Holy Spirit in my mid 20s,
 I would read books about John and Carol, I'd read books by John and Carol.
 I didn't know them at all.
 And everything that is normal to my kids today cost me everything I had.
 Yeah.
 In terms of cost me relationships, dignity, money.
 I don't think of it in terms of course, but I had to work hard through my unbelief.
 I had to attend conferences, I had to pray out a fast, to get what I now have that my
 kids get for free.
 So I just think the kindness of God really is that I thought all my hunger in my twenties
 was for me, not knowing that everything I was doing and seeking the kingdom would have
 a reward for my children.
 Right.
 What you think about God does things in generations, doesn't he?
 He loves to do things in generations and generational blessing is a very real thing.
 So, yeah, your hunger and your passion opens a door for your children to skate through
 something that might have been uphill for you.
 And so from a very early age, they all saw in the spirit, it took me years to work I
 have seen in the spirit and I wasn't sure I could do it.
 It took me years before I ever spoke in tongues.
 My six-year-old, my eight-year-old just sings in tongues.
 And my little two year old when I put them to bed is doing his best speaking in tongues, you can take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it
 and then apologize when you get it wrong.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
 I mean, we're lucky to have a lot of good parenting
 influences around this.
 Like Julia, Marty, Curly are amazing.
 So there's people that we can go to and go,
 I think I screwed up or I don't know what to do
 with this situation or this question or whatever.
 So I think parenting is a lot about apologizing
 and doing the best you can and, you know,
 And I also think not being embarrassed about the Holy Spirit.
 Yeah.
 So if you're at home, in our home, you know, we'd have worship music on.
 We are reading books.
 We are, they overhear our conversations.
 They listen to some breakfast talk to each other about the dreams we had last night.
 So it all becomes very, very normal for them.
 So I can't remember your question was, Ella, but I hope that helps.
 And we don't have any cooler stories than the ones we've already told on our podcast.
 Yeah.
 you them as they come along, has that? Alright, let's wrap this bad boy up. Yeah. Because
 there's apple pie. There is apple pie. And there's hogging does. And there's muffins
 to make and chicken salad to me. Forget that. There's hogging does. It's Sunday night.
 There's Dolce and Vanillavine with apple pie. You're a steer. We've got two things going
 on this week. We've got our show notes go to lmaj.com/71. But we're also doing a fun
 little internet project. We would love you to send us a selfie of you. Oh yeah. We're
 putting together a little video and we'd love to have you in that video. So here's what
 to do. Take a selfie or find one you already love. Upload it to Twitter, Instagram, Facebook,
 etc. And tag us in it. We are @allyn and AJ on Twitter and Instagram. And on Facebook,
 you'll find us as Alan and AJ Jones. And then we'll collect them all. We'll make a
 a beautiful collage.
 But could you do that first this week?
 We'd love to get as many selfies as we possibly can.
  </li><li>Yeah, be great.
  </li><li>We'll put something out on our website too.
 And then thirdly, around about this time,
 everybody asks us for our Halloween talk.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It is on our website, but because we've had so many requests,
 what I'm actually doing is taking our notes
 and taking the audio and turning it into a video
 so you can see the notes with the audio.
 And that should be up sometime this week.
 So head to lnaj.com, look in the blog,
 and we'll post a link to it there.
  </li><li>Perfect.
  </li><li>So thanks for tuning in.
 Have an amazing week, and we'll see you next week.
