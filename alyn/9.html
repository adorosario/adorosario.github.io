<p> Hey babe good to be back<br/>
 I've missing your face obscured by a microphone pop filter. Oh, thanks across the room
 But no seriously it is nice to be back. I actually missed podcasting
 Well, we did try to do it last week. We've been away on vacation for
 Almost two weeks and while we were away
 I thought of a really clever thing to do, you know while we don't need to bring our laptops
 We can just bring the mics we can plug them straight into our iPad no problem. We did all that
 Of course, I forgot to sound check anything and then our levels were all wrong
 So I was determined to do again and Blake our wonderful long-suffering producer was like hey
 You know how you guys are on vacation. Maybe you want to skip a week. Thank you Blake
 So we thought that was genius. We didn't think of that. I don't know. I didn't want to read recorded last week
 No, so sorry if you came to the website looking for a podcast, but we're back. We're back
 All right, AJ tell beautiful people where we've been
 We have been well first we went to Charlotte North Carolina
 and<br/>
 spent some time with Ben and Cara sewer Alan sister and brother-in-law and
 Obviously mine as well now<br/>
 That sounds it's a work deal<br/>
 And their kids so it was it was quite good because they're kids and our kids play really well together
 So we just don't see them for a few days
 Unless there's a dispute and we just had screeching McGee to manage
 There's also something I think I have now.
 Relax I've taken for granted the fact that I do live on the other side of the world and not my family do except for my sister who lives a mere nine hours away.
 Honey it's seven hours it's nine hours like with stops if we stop forever okay so it's nine hours then no it didn't it took us like seven and a half I love how you expand things okay anything over an hour in the car is like twelve hours to me he starts twitching and going and boy and boy.
 And anyone that happens in the first 15 minutes,
 when is why I don't want to drive?<br/>
 I don't want you driving board because I want to live on that topic.
 Let's talk about this genius solution that we came up with for driving.
 So first of all, that set the context.
 Yes.<br/>
 Generally speaking, Asia does most of the driving in our marriage relationship.
 Yes.<br/>
 There's a couple of reasons for that.<br/>
 One, she is one of these people that enjoys driving.
 You know, how those people who really enjoy driving, like, as an, you know, what are you going to do this afternoon?
 I think we go for a drive.<br/>
 She's one of those people she takes pleasure from driving.
 And she's also a really good driver.<br/>
 I'm an ambivalent driver.<br/>
 I don't care.<br/>
 I'd actually prefer not to drive<br/>
 because I do have a fairly short attention span.
 And I've realized that when I'm driving with people
 who realize I have a short attention span,
 it feels like they'd sooner drive.<br/>
 So I'm happy for them to drive.<br/>
 The trouble is when we do a long journey,
 AJ naturally gets bored because she's having a drive.
 you're playing a video game and ignoring me. Let's be honest, that's what's happening.
 That's, that's our perspective you could take. That is what's happening.
 So we need to find a solution. I want to talk to you and you're like, babe, babe, I'm just,
 I'm in the middle of something. But the thing is, I bring my phone down and say, okay, well,
 let's talk. What do you want to talk about? And you're like, um, anything. So then I, you know,
 feels like you're scraping the bottom of the barrel to bring up and to fake a conversation.
 Anyway, that is the problem that we faced, but we came up with a genius solution.
 We did.<br/>
 Which is?<br/>
 Which is audio books.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 So audible.com, I have a little iPhone app, and I realized if I bought a book, a really long book,
 it lasted 13 hours.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 She could just plug her headphones in and she could just drive and listen to somebody reading her a book,
 which meant I was free to play threes all the way to North Carolina.
 Our kids had iPads in the back and they were fine and MJ just needed yoga, but DVDs exchanged every four or five minutes.
 And the time just flew.<br/>
 It did. Although MJ has figured out how to make a horrific noise now.
 I do. I'm not enjoying the stage of parenting.
 It's like having a pet pterodactyl.<br/>
 It's on crack.<br/>
 It's the noise you're not enjoying.<br/>
 He's being super sweet and he's being really cuddly and he loves to give kisses.
 And he's learning all kinds of new words, but he has this horrible noise that he
 makes when he wants something and he can't communicate, of course, fully what he wants
 yet. So he points and then screeches.<br/>
 It's horrible.<br/>
 But he's also in that I want to dominate.
 I swear, if he knew how to pee, which he of course he does, but if he knew how to pee on command,
 he would mark every territory with urine.
 But so everywhere we go, he just wants to dominate.
 So he'll push us this is either way,<br/>
 if I'm lying on the floor doing something,
 he'll come and sit in my head,<br/>
 he'll do the same with AJ.<br/>
 He is just in this, I am owning my domain stage.
</p><ul>
  <li>And then he giggles.
  </li><li>Which is very cute.
  </li><li>It's crazy.
  </li><li>But this walking noise is horrendous.
  </li><li>Horrible.
  </li><li>Anyway, we're geniuses because we discovered audio books,
 you know, only like five years, seven years too late,
 but anyway, we found them.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>That was really helpful.
 of interest. Well, I'm listening to one of my favorite fiction series.
 Stephen King. No. Stephen, Stephen Lawheed, Stephen King by Stephen Lawheed,
 is a Christian writer, writes mostly about Celtic history. And it's a series called
 The Song of Albion. So I listened to the first book, which is called The Paradise War, and
 I'm halfway through the next one, which is called The Silver Hand.
 And if you do have a long trip coming up, married couples, and you do want to take advantage
 of audible.com. They have a free month where you can get a free book, which is great. So
 go ahead and take that. How was your Fourth of July, babe? Well, actually, before we did
 Fourth of July, we had Canada Day on the first of July. We did. Talk to us about what happens
 on Canada Day in Canada. It's pretty much the same thing as what happens on the Fourth
 of July only. We don't have red, white and blue stuff. We have red and white stuff. We
 to differentiate.
 And you know, we have like big fireworks shows and typically we make s'mores in the evening
 over campfires on the beach.
 But it sounds pretty similar.
 It's yeah, it's pretty similar.
 Big barbecues, big parties.
 Someone's had a big barbecue and fireworks and rockets.
 And MJ was terrified of the rockets.
 We had to take him inside until they were done because he kept crying every time we were
 off.
 Being a Canadian in America, is there a sense of pride that you guys formed your nation
 three days before America?
 That must feel good.
 Except that we didn't.
 We formed our nation like a hundred and something years after.
 I can't even remember now.
 Isn't that funny?
 It's a long time after, but it just happens to be celebrated three days before each year.
 Oh, I see.
 Oh, okay.
 All right.
 Well, now I feel done.
 We're in our sisters.
 Yeah, we are in their house.
 And then what do we do after that?
 Tell us a fun story.
 Well, we'll back up the story, give the context
 of the fun part of the story.
 OK, so the context is we were going to have a staycation
 for the two weeks that we had off.
 And I was not looking forward to that.
 Alan was like, well, get stuff done around the house.
 It'll be awesome.
 Because I speak in a high-pitched falsetto voice.
 said, well, good stuff down around the house.
 It'll be awesome.
 Apparently I just grew a mustache and way more
 chest here.
 So anyway, so I think he was trying to take lemons and make
 lemonade or something, one of those sort of analogies.
 The truth is I'm happy anywhere on vacation as long as I'm left
 alone.
 So it doesn't matter where I am.
 But then if you're being left alone, that means I'm being
 left with all three kids, which doesn't spell vacation for me.
 through my coming plan.
 Anyway, you had really wanted to.
 I really wanted to get away from it.
 And the girls were praying to do the beach.
 And I don't unplug while being at home.
 I feel I need to get away to feel like I'm away.
 And so, and then we had told Abby and Tia, hey, we have vacation next week.
 And Abby said, Mommy, what beach are we going to?
 And I said, Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
 We're not going to the beach this year.
 And she was like, we're not going to the beach.
 Like beach equals vacation.
 She just couldn't get her little head around it.
 So we said, no, we're not going,
 but I had, you know, I was obviously like,
 Lord, I'd really love to be able to get away somewhere,
 but I'm also going to determine in my heart
 that I'm okay being home and you somehow will make this okay.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>So then I'm in my own business and I get a phone call
 from someone who I've actually never met.
 Just interesting.
 And they introduce themselves to me like,
 Hey, you know, I'm so and so and my wife was actually praying this morning and she felt
 like we should call you and say we should do something for you.
 I travel a lot, so I have a whole lot of hotel miles or hotel points I beg your pardon.
 And I'm just wondering, are you on a staycation by preference or by choice or could we like
 make some hotels available to you and we're like, are you kidding?
 We're like, no, we'd love to.
 So just pick a hotel anywhere in America you'd like to be and we'll take care of it for
 So we realized well we're in North Carolina, it's not far to drive to the beach, so we drove over to Myrtle Beach.
 And when we got there, you know, if somebody's paying for your hotel, you're happy wherever you are, we're just happy to be at the beach.
 And so, well, when we get there, this person happens to be a top tier member of one of the hotel chains.
 And so we've been upgraded to a 1400 square foot.
 Two bedroom.
 Two bath.
 to bath, or to condo with a dining room, wrapped balcony condo right on the ocean,
 like right on the ocean.
 So when we get through a rock off of our balcony,
 which is legal in the state of South Carolina, if we could throw well enough,
 we could have done this.
 The stickers said on every window to the balcony, I was like, well,
 there's my first thing to do on vacation, just not going to happen.
 So I want to throw stuff off a balcony.
 Did it say there was stickers saying we're not allowed to?
 I did not even know this.
 I'm the reader of decals on Windows.
 Well, see, those are there for the people that need to read them.
 I just would never consider doing it, so I didn't need to read the stickers.
 You can only enter a little polite.
 Yes.
 So anyway, we got hooked up with a beautiful condo right on the beach.
 Beautiful.
 Which the kids were just super thrilled with.
 With a king-sized bed.
 Yes.
 Mm-hmm.
 I'm not saying anything.
 Look how mature I am.
 Maybe you're really--
 You're really--
 --passing 40.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Really.
 Can resist the temptation to make inappropriate comments much.
 Well, let's just wait to the end of the podcast and see if you've made it through the whole thing.
 You have a little faith.
 So we got to stay there and then about halfway through this same person called back and said,
 hey, you know, we're just wondering if you're having a good time like we are.
 What would I to extend your stay if you'd like to?
 And we're like, yes, we would.
 So we just got hooked up and it was amazing.
 It was amazing.
 Jesus coming through again, just being absolutely awesome, fantastic.
 And this condo thing had like a kids' waterpark attached to it and like seven pools or something
 crazy like that.
 And it's right on the beach.
 So we literally could walk out of our thing, walk on the beach, which was MJ's first time
 in the beach.
 So the first time we put his feet on the sand, he was very confused.
 But he got the hang of it quickly and started chasing birds.
 So it was very cute.
 We were going to shock how long it takes a family of five, three of whom are under seven
 to get ready to go outside though.
 Yeah, it's true.
 screen, mostly applying sunscreen.
 Yeah.
 And then chasing down the smallest one and wrestling them into its swimming shorts.
 Yeah.
 Crazy.
 Um, we discovered our kids love Habachi.
 They do.
 They really do.
 She is favorite thing now.
 And she'll even eat the vegetables.
 That's right.
 Parents out there, if you need your young children to eat vegetables, just take them
 to Habachi Grill.
 Make sure they don't touch that searing plate in the center of your table.
 You can't reach it.
 We don't have any readers questions this week simply because, well, actually, I don't know
 if we do or don't.
 They all come to my email, which I've turned off because I'm on vacation.
 I'm too scared to turn on my email to look for readers questions because if I see something
 I need to reply to, I'm probably going to be dragged into it.
 So I'm forcing myself to remain disciplined and on vacation.
 But AJ Jones, I wanted to bring up this week's topic in honor of the 238th birthday of this
 this great nation that we live in.
 I wanted to talk about America.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>For a long, long, long, long time,
 almost as long as I can remember,
 I've always wanted to live in America.
  </li><li>And I've always thought I was going to live in America.
  </li><li>Which is funny, 'cause when I met you
 and I was dating and I was thinking,
 you know, I know I'm here in Canada,
 but I feel like I'm gonna be moving to America.
 I feel like my destiny is in America.
 I was wondering how, you know,
 a through and through Maple Leaf leading Canadian
 would feel out about living in America.
 I remember the day I kind of,
 We weren't married yet.
 I think we're engaged.
 And I remember floating the idea past you like,
 "Hey, you know, I kind of think that God says
 we're gonna live in America.
 How do you feel about that?"
 And you were like, "Oh, I've known that for years."
 So I was like, "Yay!"
  </li><li>Yep. But I mean, I'm still pretty die-hard Canadian,
 but I do love America.
  </li><li>Yeah, your Canadian flag tattoo is going nowhere.
  </li><li>I know.
  </li><li>When we used to travel, and we used to travel a lot
 for those of you who've done a lot of our life,
 we'd travel all over the world.
 People would inevitably ask us, you've travelled everywhere, what's your favourite country?
 And the true answer, my favourite country was America.
 And whenever I'd land in America, whenever I'd land at whatever airport was, I would
 just feel I would almost be moved to tears and several times I would be crying.
 And I've just always loved this nation.
 So I thought it would be interesting to ask you, AJ, who's been part of North America,
 the continent.
 That's right.
 Way to go, me.
 I'm really going to be just not good.
 It's the reason we don't homeschool, huh?
 It's like so many reasons.
 Like, like I posted on Instagram a couple of weeks ago,
 you're drawing of a map of the world, which was missing so many nations.
 I can't even tell you that we've actually been to and all of South America.
 Sorry, folks gone details.
 Um, I forgot what I was saying about America.
 Oh, yeah.
 differences between I would imagine that the differences for me and my upbringing and my life now and the
 differences for you and Europe bringing your life now are probably somewhat larger
 But I thought would still be interested nevertheless
 I'm also aware that for me to say the difference in living in America and Scotland is a ludicrous thing because I could live in
 Many different parts of America have a different experience. So let's narrow it down. You grew up in Toronto
 Yes. What are three major differences? You know it's from life in Toronto to life in Franklin, Tennessee.
 It's a lot greener and prettier here in Franklin and we have no snow.
 Well, that's not true. There are snow days here. Yeah, there's no days. You're like, "I think I saw a random fleck floating through the sky.
 Shut down the schools. We're all gonna die get off the roads people get your eggs get your milk get your bread
 They tone it down
 You know it's true. That's only because in Toronto
 It wouldn't be that uncommon for us to have snow days
 Where you'd have to shove yourself out of the house, right?
 So there's a difference and nobody shut down a school for it
 The with every time when you grew up that your schools were closed because of snow
 Oh, yeah
 But you'd have to be getting several feet of snow or like I mean a ridiculous amount of snow for them to close down to school for it
 Okay, we're here somebody can say the word snow that it might happen tomorrow and the clothes down the school
 Did somebody say snow let's close the schools down
 When you say prettier obviously pretty is neither beholder because I think Toronto is very very pretty like I love
 Toronto is a beautiful city. It's absolutely gorgeous. One of my favorite cities.
 It's very clean and it's very safe. But what you're referring to is the abundance of green
 velocirally hills. Yes, if you came to where we live, it's these rolling green hills and
 an overpopulation of deer, but just everything pretty. Yeah, it honestly feels like you could
 just turn left off one of the main roads and you would be in the country. Yeah. And it's
 absolutely gorgeous.
 Yeah.
 All right, last thing.
 And there's nowhere near the amount of traffic.
 Nowhere near the amount of traffic.
 Toronto's traffic is just insane.
 And then here, it's like, if I've experienced traffic,
 it might make my trip five minutes longer
 than it would have been without traffic.
 Where's in Toronto?
 Well, I mean--
 2EW, a rush hour.
 Oh my gosh.
 You know, if you have a left way early,
 you could have a trip that would normally take you 40
 or 45 minutes to get across the city,
 take you an hour and a half or three hours. I mean, it's just crazy.
 Which should probably be one of the biggest differences. Here, our friend group is within
 20 minutes of driving with the furthest we'd need to drive.
 The very furthest we'd need to drive this. Whereas in Toronto, probably the shortest
 we'd need to drive to go see friends is the longest we'd need to drive here.
 Yeah, like our closest friends would have been 20 minutes, but most of them would have been
 more around 40 minutes away.
  </li><li>That's how an hour went.
  </li><li>Or more, yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, like this is--
  </li><li>Just because of traffic.
 Just because of traffic.
  </li><li>And it's so enormous.
 Like that's why I couldn't get over.
 When I moved from Edinburgh to Toronto,
 I couldn't get over how far away the horizon was.
 Like you'd be driving along the road and you'd look right
 and there's just so much land.
 It's just enormous.
 And in terms of the population size,
 What is like Toronto six and a half million people in Toronto?
 I maintain this larger than that.
 Okay, sorry, I haven't looked up Wikipedia yet.
 I haven't looked at that in an enormous amount of people.
 Yeah.
 All right, my top three things,
 from living in Scotland, living in Edinburgh,
 and living in Nashville is,
 I lived in Edinburgh for years and years and years
 and years without ever needing a car
 because public transport was absolutely available
 and you could walk pretty much everywhere again.
 Well, and you do walk most places.
 Yes. You'd walk or you could take a bus or you know taxi here. I don't think do we have taxis here?
 I'm we must have taxis. I've seen a couple but not very often and you know our public transport is
 almost non-existent. So every drive yep, which is fine or bikes than them healthy people they bike right whether
 You know people always ask me, but what's the weather like in Scotland?
 I'd be like, well, it's easy to tell a difference between like summer and winter because in summer, the rain is warmer.
 This is completely true, but no, sometimes it's just as cold.
 I was in Scotland earlier this year in January and I took a picture from my hometown of Dundee across the river.
 I took a picture. I did nothing to it. I didn't filter it. I didn't, you know, add anything on Instagram.
 I just posted and said, this is a real picture in color and everything.
 during the day it was like midday it was great on great people thought it was a
 black and white yeah photo yeah I remember Billy Connolly who's a very
 famous Scottish comedian who then moved to Los Angeles I remember him saying
 that his kids who'd been raised in LA he brought them back to Scotland and
 when they got off the plane they said dad why is the sky so low so yeah
 Obviously the weather.
 And then I, you know, the pace of life is completely completely
 different. Yeah, absolutely different in terms of do you
 mean in Edinburgh and Toronto? No, I mean here. Like, so the
 pace of life that I have here versus the pace of life I had in
 in Scotland is was completely different. Yeah, everything
 seems much slower here. Everything is a little bit more laid
 back. And the drivers are much slower here. Yeah, they are.
 And then Toronto for sure.
 But I love it.
 I kind of just one of the biggest privileges ever to live in America.
 And I'm excited about getting my citizenship in five years.
 About three and a half.
 Yeah, I'm probably going to have to learn something about geography
 because they might ask me like state capitals or something.
 Yeah.
 Go and test me.
 Throw me out of something.
 Ah, name five states.
 Oh, easy.
 North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Alabama.
 California. Ooh, can you name five more? Well, I know the District of Columbia is not state,
 so I've not mentioned that one. Hawaii, Alaska, Texas, and then I'm more visual, so I can
 see them. There's that one and that one and that one. You didn't mention the state, so
 We were actually in last week.
  </li><li>Do you want me to draw you now?
 North Carolina, South Carolina, boom.
  </li><li>No, no, they don't boom.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Talk to me about how we ended up in America.
 'Cause it was a pretty interesting story.
  </li><li>Because you don't remember or--
  </li><li>No, I do remember, but people often ask us,
 and I think we've maybe only preached about it
 like once or twice, and I love the story.
 When I listen back to it, it seems way more spectacular
 than it did when I was experiencing it,
 if that doesn't sound too weird.
  </li><li>Okay.
 When I tell the story, I kind of slap myself on the side of the head going, "Man, what
 took me so long?"
 Right.
 But when I was in it, it didn't feel as supernatural as it was.
 It did to me.
 It did feel like that to me.
 I remember, yeah, I had so much excitement about it.
 But well, essentially...
 Well, and let me pause on that.
 I think though, because of your wiring, prophetic or otherwise, that you're usually
 where of the end before the process begins.
 Yeah.
 Makes sense.
 Yeah.
 Whereas I usually need to understand the process before I can see the end.
 Right.
 Because if I see the end first, all I then see are obstacles of how to get to the end.
 Right.
 Does that make sense?
 So it wasn't that I wasn't excited about it.
 I just wasn't sure about it in the first place to work out whether I wanted to devote emotion,
 excitement, or otherwise to the process.
 Right. All right. I'll show up now. You talk.
 So you wanted to just talk about how we got here. I mean, should we do an abbreviated version?
 And then you can fill in details that we miss. Sure. I'd love to hear you do an abbreviated
 version of any story. Go watch this, baby. Well, I was born in Toronto and I grew up.
 shot it. No, we were in Toronto and we were praying and we wanted to get pregnant again.
 Abby was almost a year old, not quite. And we were just thinking, okay, we want to have
 our kids close together. We've been dragging Abby all over the world. And I don't think we want
 to do it with two babies. So we started talking to the Lord and looking at our prophetic words
 in regards to what was next. Did you want to add something?
 Yeah, I was just going to say Abigail, who was one, had done 110 flights.
 106.
 But yeah, by the time she was one, she'd just been all over the world and more than that in the womb.
 And yeah, when we asked the Lord, he just said, "Go look at your prophetic words,"
 which was interesting because we'd just been collecting the same prophetic word.
 Over and over again.
 For the last two years.
 Which was all about pastoring.
 All about pastoring and planting new things.
 Yeah.
 Which we were like, "I don't really want to be a pastor."
 No, but I think some of that was we'd seen a lot of pastors that were having a really hard time,
 so it didn't make it seem like something that we would enjoy.
 And the life of an itinerant is really much like Santa Claus. You fly in, you do a weekend on
 something really cool and sexy, and then you fly out again. And you're not really responsible for
 the people that you minister to. And so in one sense, you're, of course,
 Of course, there's lots of negatives of that, the toll of traveling and all that.
 But the positives are enormous.
 You only get to meet lots of people.
 You're in a new city every week.
 And there is an element where you are like Santa Claus, you come and you deliver some
 gifts and then you leave.
 Yeah.
 And then also I had a faulty view of what pastoring was.
 Yeah.
 And that was the one thing the Lord said to me was, "You actually get to be a pastor the
 way you want to be a pastor."
 The way that you're wired.
 You don't have to be somebody else.
 Oh, oh, oh.
 It's a huge relief.
 Because I think both of us were quite blunt.
 And I mean, I hope hopefully we're loving, but, but I mean, we're just,
 uh, I don't know, I guess how I viewed what we'd need to be able to be, to be a pastor.
 We weren't that appealing.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So, but on the, on the flip side, you're saying about the itinerant, you know, getting
 to be Santa Claus and all that kind of stuff.
 I think the thing I love the most about what we do now is we get to actually see the transformation.
 for sure.
 When we were itinerant, we would just hear stories and by then faces have blended together
 so you'd hear from a pastor, "You remember Susie that you prayed for?"
 "Well, blah, blah, blah."
 It's this awesome story, but you have no...
 You've now moved on to the next thing.
 Right.
 I think it's a classic, "The Lord asks you to do something."
 This side of obedience, you're like, "Eh, I don't think so because of X, Y, and Z."
 But then hopefully you're wise enough to say yes to God.
 And on the other side, your objections of X, Y, and Z aren't even valid because what
 he's asked you to do is far greater and more satisfying than you could have even imagined.
 And that's certainly what it's been like for us.
 But I digress.
 So we ask the Lord, he says, you know, prophetic words are all past for him, you know, starting
 new things.
 And then within the week, we were, this is when we lived with John and Carol and we were
 in the basement and John called us and said, Hey, guys, come upstairs, you know, blah,
 blah.
 up stairs and he said, "What do you think is next for you? John has an uncanny timing
 or ability to just know what God's chatting with you about and help you out with that."
 So we said, "Well, we think pastoring or church planting or something." At that moment, we
 decided to pray with them about planting something in the U.S. and we traveled with them. We spent
 the four days praying in a location in the south just sort of going, "Okay, you know,
 God, is this where we could do it? What are we actually asking of us?" And none of the
 four of us got a yes on that. And so we're like, "Okay, that's interesting." And while we were
 there, though, Carol said, "Did I ever tell you about my vision about the states?" And we said,
 "No." And she said, "Well, I saw three pins dropping on the map of the United States, and
 And one of the pins, she said, dropped in Nashville.
 And Alan and I both perked up.
 We're in the backseat of the car as we were driving around
 and we went, we'll do Nashville.
 And then we looked at each other like,
 why did we see that?
  </li><li>Yeah, I wasn't interested in the statement
 because what does Wheel Do Nashville even mean?
  </li><li>Yeah, we didn't know.
  </li><li>Like, no job has been offered to us.
 We don't even know where Nashville is on the map.
  </li><li>No, neither of us have ever administered in Tennessee.
  </li><li>Nope.
 (laughs)
 So it was quite a--
 The probably the only thing that we knew about Nashville was, well, not even that.
 I don't think I was even that clued in for that, was we had some friends in Florida who
 were planning on moving to Nashville.
 Yes.
 So that literally was the only tie, the only piece of information we could offer on what
 does Nashville look like or where is it?
 But nevertheless, there was a function to use a nice religious term.
 There was a jump in our hearts when we said,
 "We'll do Nashville."
 And it mirrored in John and Carol's heart too.
 They were like, "Yes."
 And so I actually remember us toasting at lunch,
 "We're gonna do Nashville."
  </li><li>Yay.
  </li><li>And at the back of my head,
 I was like, "I don't quite know what that means."
 Like, what does that mean at all?
  </li><li>And I said to Carol, like when it was just Carol
 and I and Abby, I said, "Carol, I know we end up
 in Nashville."
 And she said, "So do I."
  </li><li>Which made that much easier
 when we had to leave Toronto.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's true.
 Yeah, 'cause we not only left an amazing church,
 amazing church family, but we lived with John and Carol and it was, it was pretty hard,
 but at the same time it was pretty easy because we knew we'd heard God so clearly.
 So, Riddle me this, when we said we'll do Nashville, did you, at what point did you
 know that we were moving to Nashville then?
 I knew then.
 So you knew?
 Yeah, because when...
 Did you know timing?
 No, you and John dropped us off to go get a table at the restaurant.
 Because it was pouring a rain in the worst chivalrous chance.
 No, it wasn't.
 I don't think it was raining.
 See, you just don't remember anything.
 I just didn't want to carry Abby that far. I think she was asleep in her car. So it was pouring with rain. I remember
 Okay, all right, but you know, I'm not gonna bring that up because I'm too humble. Right. Yes, of course
 But I got out of the car with Carol and and after he dropped us off and I turned to Carol
 And I said we we I know we end up in Nashville and she said so do I
 But I didn't clue and I was just like okay God somehow we end up there and there was a both an excitement and a piece
 of knowing what was next but not knowing exactly the timing of it.
 See, I didn't know any of that. I was just like, oh, that was weird. I was like, oh, we'll do Nashville.
 Um, so we kept praying.
 We kept praying and I was a chronicle chronological order of what happened.
 So far we're fine. Um, so we're just speeding through this short version of the story.
 So I, I, I said to Alan, can we go to Nashville? Can we go and feel it out and whatever? And, um,
 we didn't really have a time when we could do that and we already blown all our points to go in.
 Feel at the last place as it were so we're like oh we can't you know.
 And then we flew to Iceland and we went to Iceland for a series of meetings but while we were in Iceland Alan had a dream.
 Cue Alan yeah i dream that to this day is the most profound dream of ever had my life and i've had some pretty profound dreams.
 And you know tell the dream and it's not going to sound profound that that was the bizarre thing i remember in the dream thinking this is the most amazing dream.
 But well let me tell you dream so it's a dream within the dream i have two dreams and i don't realize i'm dreaming the first dream until i wake up from the second dream.
 So in the first dream, I'm not aware I'm dreaming and I get a phone call from John and Carol and they say, Alan, you need to come and see what God has done for us.
 It's absolutely amazing.
 And I said, where are you?
 And they said, we're in America.
 So age and I fight America and John and Carol have been given this enormous house.
 I mean, this house is the size of a city block.
 It is enormous.
 It's, you know, several stories tall and we're just toasting that they've been given this house.
 We're toasting the goodness of God. We're saying, look, this is so extravagant. This is so amazing.
 And in the middle of us celebrating what God's done for them, they turned to us and say, we want to
 give you half the house for $300 a month. And I wake up, but I'm still in the dream. So I'm now
 a second dream. And so I get a phone call in the second dream from John and Carol. And they said,
 you've got to come and see what God has done for us. It's absolutely amazing. I said, where are
 This is where in America, flight to America with AJ, and we find out that God's given them an enormous house.
 It's just an incredible incredible house that
 is about city block at several stories tall, we're toasting the goodness of God, and in the middle of it John and Carol turned us and say
 we want to give you half the house for three hundred dollars and I
 Wake up out of that's that dream into the first dream and I go back to John said John
 "It's incredible. I know that you've just been given this incredible house, but I just had a dream that you were given the house."
 And in the dream it was more significant that I'd had a dream that they'd been given a house than the fact that they'd been given the house by God.
 Like that was what was astonishing. And as I tell John this, now back in the first dream, John looks at me and says,
 "You need to connect with Jeff Daller, and you need to connect with him now."
 and then I wake up just like a bolt of lightning, wake up in the natural,
 climb out of bed, write it all down, and think, "That is just bizarre."
  </li><li>And at the time... - We'd never met Jeff Daller.
  </li><li>We'd never met Jeff Daller. We didn't know he was in Nashville, Tennessee.
  </li><li>I think we did. The only reason I think we did was we knew about Alberto and Kimberly Rivera,
 and I think we'd overheard a conversation that they were at his church.
 That was the only tenuous thing. We didn't know what Jeff looked like.
  </li><li>I didn't think we did know that at that point.
 Well, I think because we were planning to go to Nashville to do the Il-Sum later that year,
 we'd maybe heard his name and somebody in Toronto said, "Oh, that's the church that Rivera's go to."
 Oh, okay.
 So, you know, whether we knew it or not is almost neither near nor there.
 So, armed with this piece of information, I call John, and I don't forget where he is in the world,
 I just tell John, "John, I had this dream. What do you think it means?"
 And he said, "I think it means you should connect with Jeff Dollar."
 So he gives me Jeff's email address.
 And at that point, Alan agrees that we can go to Nashville and feel out.
 You want to talk about why you wanted to go to Nashville?
 Because I I tend to be like a feeler. So I tend to be in a place and I feel things
 Right, which I'm not but I realized my wife is so I have to place a value on the way she hears from God
 Was the revelation I had just because I don't need it. Yeah, it's important that you have what you need to make a decision
 So I mean I wanted to come and like when we had gone to the previous place
 I I just felt absolutely nothing even though it was a beautiful place. I was like no
 So I wanted to come and just see okay, Lord is there favor on the idea of us being here, you know that kind of stuff
 Right so I email Jeff is that hey, we think we're coming to hate you don't notice at all we're
 Actually gonna beat your church in a couple of months. We were coming to do a conference with John in Carolina
 anyway, but hey, we just have to be in Nashville this weekend.
 Actually, our friends were moving up from Florida.
 So we said, Hey, we've got friends who are moving.
 We're coming down to see them.
 We'll be in Nashville.
 We'd love to meet you for lunch if you've got time in your schedule.
 And he was like, sure.
 So I remember it to this day.
 We met at jail examiners in Nashville.
 But now you're skipping ahead because that was we came here.
 And again, I'm saying, Lord, is our favor on the idea of us being here.
 And when we checked into the first hotel, we got upgraded to the Presidential Suite,
 which was massive.
 Right.
 And so here's the funny part for all you Nashvilians coming from Toronto, again, an enormous city.
 We thought, "We'll book three different hotels to get three different views of the city."
 I don't mean views as in panoramic views to look at and take photographs of.
 I just meant to see different parts of the city, now realizing how small in comparison
 national is to Toronto that was so funny. So we moved the second day to a different hotel
 and got the presidential suite again, which was the whole, you know, it was the Sheridan downtown
 as the whole one side of the Sheridan. One whole side of the Sheridan, you know, had like two
 bedrooms in a library and a massive dining room thing that's at 16 people. And I mean,
 just like we were like, okay. And then when we moved to our third hotel, same thing happened.
 So we're like, okay, Lord, there seems to be favor following us as we're here.
 And then when we met Jeff, our little daughter Abigail was going through the season where she did not want to be with anybody, only my main daddy.
 She wouldn't even go John and Carol.
 And we lived with them.
 So as soon as she sees Jeff, she reaches for him and then she sits on his lap all the way through lunch.
 Yeah, she ate her food with Jeff.
 And we just talked to Jeff.
 like Jeff and yeah and we're not thinking anything about Grace Center or
 no we really liked Jeff we really really like and we know we knew that the Lord
 was saying something in the way that Abby was responding to him as well and
 you know the dream was you need to connect with Jeff to all of us we just
 have been obedient so we meet Jeff then we came to Grace Center on that Sunday
 yeah we just we were in town and we we need somewhere church so we came to
 Grace Center and that was the weekend that they had James Ryle in and they took
 up an offering. They didn't tell anybody where the offer was going to be. And they took up $204,000
 in a couple of services. And they said, "We're going to give this away." And then they decided
 to give it away to a church that had just been demolished by a tornado. And so we're at this
 church. And Chris McLawney was leading worship. And interestingly, we'd never heard anybody
 like Chris McLawney, except for Luke Finch. So we'd just come from being in England where we'd
 we'd heard Luke Finch lead and we're like, man, this guy is just so awesome.
 So when we heard Chris, we were like, oh my gosh, it's an American Luke Finch.
 And so we loved the worship, loved the presence of God, loved that this church
 was just obviously bathed in generosity and was just given away $204,000.
 And it was significant that James Rau was speaking because he was the person
 who really launched you into ministry.
 You responded to an article.
 Yeah, I mean, he doesn't know me from Adam, but it was, it was a message that he
 spoke in Toronto that that day was the day that that changed everything for me in terms of I
 was now like, okay, I'm going into ministry. Right. So you personally responded to a message
 that he preached? Yeah. So there's lots of all these little things, but probably most importantly,
 we were in this church and we just thought, if we moved to Nashville, we could go here.
 Like we love. I remember walking down the hallway thinking I could go here and then I started crying
 because I thought I've been in hundreds and hundreds of churches in the last several years,
 and lots of them really, really lovely churches. But my heart has always been like,
 "I don't want to leave Toronto. I don't want to leave TACF." And that was the first time that my
 heart felt a freedom to even think that. So I remember thinking, "I could go here." And I thought,
 "We do go here." Like, you know, there was a transfer that was happening already.
 Wow. And then as we head back to the airport, you stopped in some store.
 J crew stopped at J crew and my computer saying your disc is almost full.
