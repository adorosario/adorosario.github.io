<p> I live in a days podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Jones is welcome to episode one seventy six of keeping up with the Jones is where this week we're talking about the kindness of God.
 But first Alan how is the week the week was full.
 It was ask me how I know that how do you know that because I'm arriving at the end of it limping.
 I know, right?<br/>
 Just like, I'm gonna make it.
</p><ul>
  <li>Monday and Tuesday, we were both teaching at the school.
 I like it when we're both teaching.
  </li><li>Why?
  </li><li>Well, I like it when we're in the thick of it.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I don't like the fallout of that
 because neither of us have energy for anything else.
  </li><li>No, it's like, do we have to feed the children?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Couldn't they learn fasting this week?
  </li><li>And you made an interesting point.
 You were teaching Ephesians,
 verse by verse through the whole book.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I've never done that,
 but I've never done anything like that.
 And you're saying it's mentally, not exhausting,
 but it's mentally tiring because you're reading every verse,
 you're encouraging the students to stop and ask anything.
 And then you discuss, so you're having a mentally
 keep track of what you've prepared,
 where you're going, what the time is.
 I've got six sessions to get this through.
 Plus I'm leaving room for questions.
 You have no idea what kind of questions you're gonna get,
 what curve balls are gonna come at you.
 I'd never thought of that because when I teach in
 and teaching is hard work and it is tiring
 as any teacher will tell you,
 I know the star, I know where I'm going.
 If we deviate, at least I know where I'm getting on.
 That's a whole different kind of teaching.
  </li><li>Yeah, the only one talking when you're teaching.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, I think because I do say,
 hey, you can ask questions or even mention observations
 that you've seen, I'm constantly trying to keep in mind
 while listening to what they're saying is,
 is that within the context of the material,
 is that historically accurate?
 Can we actually make that work for today?
 You know, all that kind of stuff.
 Is there anything I need to correct in what you just said?
 You know, and you know, so yeah, it's by the end of it.
 I mean, I love teaching those weeks, but I'm exhausted.
 Like I am just a different level of tired.
  </li><li>Right, it's like we have no mental capacity
 for anything else.
  </li><li>Yeah, and then it's like, I mean, it's horrible,
 but you get home and it's, you know,
 "Hey, mommy this, mommy that Christmas is coming.
 Mummy, why are there presents under the tree?
 Mummy, whatever.
 And I'm like, can you just put Mummy to bed?
 Can you guys cook yet?
 I mean, can, you know, so yeah.
  </li><li>So while you're teaching Ephesians in second year,
 I was teaching on five-fold ministry.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>We haven't done a podcast episode in five-fold ministry.
  </li><li>I don't think so.
  </li><li>Well, maybe we'll do it some other time.
 But that's a topic that we had in second year.
 We moved to first year.
 And again, I love teaching it,
 but it's a lot of Q&amp;A, it's a lot of back and forth.
 It's a lot of, it's funny because when I started teaching that, it was very embryonic
 for all of us.
 Right.
 And so it was fun to teach it in that, you know, we were discovering things now that
 we've been teaching this for like three or four years and our thoughts on our a bit
 more solidified, you forget that what you're teaching is fairly groundbreaking for some
 of the students just like it was for us a couple of years ago.
 And it's not that you have to wait for them to catch up, but you forget that, oh, actually
 this is kind of paradigm shifting.
 Yeah.
 So anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I hadn't taught first year in a while.
 So I'd forgotten what they're like.
 They're a great group.
 But I get to teach them for the next couple of weeks.
 I'm all excited about that.
 Yeah, you have them for three weeks in a row.
 I miss year one now.
 I think I spend, since we started year two, I spend way more time with year two than I
 do teaching on year one.
 So I miss them.
 Am I dry buying and say hello today?
 I was going to say that you're not teaching next week.
 Justin, year two, I'm in year one.
 You can stop by and say hello.
 I will.
 using you as teaching illustrations this week.
 Oh, goody. Maybe I won't.
 And then the rest of the week was just a series of parties.
 Yes, many parties.
 You had the women's Christmas tea.
 We did.
 You had a birthday party.
 Yes.
 We had the ESO cell Christmas party.
 It's true.
 And then you had the Grace Kids.
 Volunteer party.
 Volunteer party.
 Yes.
 You were like Miss Social.
 I really was.
 And then I got to Saturday.
 And I just had a hard time getting out of bed.
 I did not you jumped out of bed and you tied it all day if I remember correctly.
 Well that's true but I felt it.
 Oh yeah.
 And then today we had Lafe Hatland.
 Yes.
 He's lovely.
 He is lovely.
 I have never heard Lafe in person.
 Really?
 Yeah.
 I mean I've seen him at Toronto and I've seen him here and there but I've never sat under
 his teaching and he's just such a gentle spirit.
 Yeah he just oozes the father heart isn't he?
 Yeah he was amazing.
 Yeah.
 You went home second service because we ended up having all our small group leaders back
 for lunch and you're getting that already. But second service, he told some incredible
 stories.
 Oh, wow.
 Just some amazing stories from his ministry around the world. And yeah, it was astonishing,
 really. I'm actually surprised he told him in public.
 Well, he doesn't usually use names, does he?
 No, he didn't. But nevertheless, it was remarkable.
 Yes.
 I'll put a link in the show notes and you can listen to that. I'm being deliberately secretive.
 Boy.
 I had a great afternoon with all our leaders.
 They're so lovely.
 We got how many people in our sofa 14 15 people in so far one point. Yeah. Yep. And it was great with Christmas carols going with the fire burning people would probably have to understand that our sofa is almost a sea.
 It's it's huge when you say see you mean water body of water. No, I mean the letter C because you're trying to picture 14 people on a sofa. Yeah, it's a sectional. It's a massive. Three sides of the square almost. Yeah. Okay. Right.
 Just thought I thought I thought I'd help the visualist that are like, how did you fit 14 people and be appropriate?
 Sorry.
 All right.
 Two main topics this week.
 Yes.
 I was shocked that in 170 something podcasts, we've never done one on the kindness of God.
 I don't know how that's possible.
 Like I checked back on our index.
 I was like, wait, you're positive.
 We've done one called the goodness of God and then maybe some overlap.
 but the kindness of eyes like how is this how is this possible indeed.
 So let me make up for last time okay once upon a time I was a little boy you were so cute to right wait I started at the wrong place that's fast forward once upon a time I was a 20 something year old man bigger boy okay never mind yeah tailings cute.
 I mean so cute just not little boy cute move on keep going tail end of 2002.
 I hear about a prophetic word from Graham Cook that he gave all about the favor of God
 as Isaiah 61.
 And I listened to it and it was something I'd never heard before.
 And it was all about the kindness of God.
 And so, you know, I'd listen to a few of Graham's messages.
 And so then I started listening to messages.
 And I remember listening to a message that Graham talked about.
 And you know, if you know Graham, he teaches his whole life is about the kindness of God.
 And I remember listening to that message and I remember thinking, yeah, I'm agreeing with
 everything you were saying.
 His message was God is the kindest person I've ever met.
 And I remember thinking, yeah, I agree with that message.
 But I think our walk with God comes down to two things.
 It comes down to knowledge and it comes down to experience.
 And I think both are valuable, but both have completely different points to them.
 Okay.
 I know that Paris is the capital of France.
 Knowing that, I guess, benefits my life in some small, intangible ways.
 It would be good in the trivia quiz, pub quiz, capital of France, boom, Paris.
 Right, but experiencing it is something different.
 Right.
 Experiencing it, knowing that Paris is the capital of France and going there and maybe
 living there for a year and eating at Parisian restaurants, walking on the streets, the smell,
 the light, hearing the language, all that sort of stuff. That takes knowledge and it overshadows it.
 The experience doesn't replace the knowledge, but boy does it add to it in depth, you can't
 describe which is why you need to experience it. Yeah, it makes it 3D kind of.
 Here I am listening to Graham's testimony about the kindness of God and I'm like, "Yeah, yeah,
 it's great, it's great." And it didn't really hit me and it's a bit like the father-heart message.
 Remember when we were traveling, people would say, "Oh, what's the primary message you teach on?"
 and you'd say, "The father heart of God," and you'd get a blank face, and people would say,
 "What's that?" And you'd say, "It's the message that God loves you." And people would be like,
 "Is that it?" Right. But the life-changing message of the father heart of God is worlds away from
 Jesus' love me this time over. The Bible tells me so. It's not an intellectual ascent.
 Right. Both are true, but one is life-changing, and the other is just a piece of knowledge that
 that you add to your collection list. So come to 2003, I dug out this prophetic word.
 The start of 2003, God gave me prophetic word. It was February. I think it was the 5th or
 the 15th. I mean, I wrote down the date, but I forgot what it was. He spoke to me and he
 said at the start of this year, which by the way, was the year that I met you.
 Oh, that's so sweet. I didn't know that at the time, but he said to me, basically, the
 or give me a prophetic word and said, "Ellen, I'm about to redefine your life and kindness
 is all I'm going to have for you."
 I am God's kindness to you.
 You absolutely are.
 That is for Dan, sure.
 Yeah, you're welcome.
 Remember that when I went in to do the dishes.
 But my point was from that moment on, really, all I've lived in is the kindness of God.
 Yeah.
 And here's a funny part.
 He said to me, "I will turn every event into an opportunity for my kindness to be shown
 to you."
 glad he told me that because honestly, it was one of the keys to me discovering God's kindness.
 Well, what do you mean by that? Well, I think I got that word and then thought everything would
 be easy from then on. Like, Oh, God's going to be kind to me. That means fantastic. Nothing
 difficult, no trials, no pressure, no need for faith. The kinds of God's just going to show up,
 meet all my needs. And it's just going to be plain sailing from there. But I think what the
 The Lord was showing me was that no matter what comes my way, no matter what happens,
 the kindness of God is there.
 Yeah.
 And it's all a matter of looking for it.
 That makes me think about Psalm 23.
 Go on.
 You know, at the very end of Psalm 23 where it says, "His mercy and His kindness follow
 me all the days of my life."
 Right.
 So I remember watching somebody speaking on it and they were explaining this first and
 they were walking around on the stage and then they'd stop and look behind them really
 fast to see if they could catch a moment when it wasn't there.
 And that's what it makes me think of.
 Right.
 I think if the Lord hadn't told me that because almost immediately in my journal after he
 told me that, I went through some unfortunate stuff, I mean, just incredibly practical,
 unfortunate stuff, you know, it wasn't identity theft, a bunch of financial stuff got mixed
 up. And I got really flustered and frustrated. Actually, I remember being on the phone and
 trying to sort out the usual way I did, which was to ask things and be really boisterous.
 And in the middle of that phone call, I could feel the Holy Spirit just lift off me. And
 I hurriedly finished the phone call and I was like, "Oh, Holy Spirit, where'd you go?"
 And I went and found him. Sounds funny. He was just in the living room and I went in and
 I was like, "Holy Spirit, what's wrong?"
 And the Holy Spirit was like, "Actually, you know, courtesy is the hallmark of the kingdom
 of heaven.
 Yeah.
 And you're on the phone and you're berating this poor person.
 Did you not know there's other options available to you?"
 And I was like, "I'm so sorry.
 I don't know what you mean."
 And he's like, "Isn't my kindness enough for you?"
 And basically, you know, the Lord had said, "My kindness is for you."
 Then this event happened that according to my God, it shouldn't have happened if God's
 going to be kind to me. And then it was left for me to figure all out. Right. And then I realized,
 Oh, Oh, wait a minute, this, this is an opportunity for your kindness to show up. And so I was like,
 Holy Spirit, I'm so sorry, would you show me what you want to do? And the Holy Spirit ended up
 you solving it. And I ended up with a double portion of everything that was taken from me. And
 like from that moment on, really, the Lord was just basically saying, I want to show you that my
 kindness is available for you. And I think in the nearly 15 years since that's happened,
 I've not had a day without the kindness of God. Like where you haven't been aware of it?
 No, I mean, I've literally been on the receiving end of the kindness of God since then. Like,
 I've been acutely aware of it. Like, if I stop and think about the kindness of God, I would say
 the kindness of the Lord is the way I access His heart. I mean, dovetail that with everything
 You taught me about the father heart of God and everything that I learned in Toronto,
 but the overarching theme of the last 15 years has just been the kindness of his heart.
 I remember saying to the Lord, I remember saying, "Lord, you could actually take me right now.
 I could die a happy man because I feel like you've given me everything I ever asked for."
 That was after we were married?
 That was before we were married.
 That being sarcastic.
 I was like, "Everything that you've ever promised me you've given me."
 And I just felt like the Lord has that, you know, that right grin that sometimes he has on his face where he's just like, oh, you're adorable.
 Oh, you have no idea.
 No, honestly, I feel like my life has been a constant game of poker.
 Yeah, the God constantly lets me win and then asked me to play again and then bet all my wedding from the last game and up and up the stakes go, but he just keeps like me when talk about that time.
 We were going home from church and you talked to somebody on the ministry team and you were
 just saying, I can't believe how difficult it must be for that person.
 Well, this was probably what six or seven years ago, maybe a little bit longer.
 And we just prayed with some, with a lady on the front row and she was in the process
 of getting a divorce against her will.
 And she was just sort of saying her husband had an affair and now I was divorcing her
 and why not?
 And my heart just really went out to her.
 And so we were driving home in the car and I was like, oh, babe, you know, so and so,
 you know, her husband is asking her for divorce and he's been having an affair.
 And I just, I can't even imagine how painful that is.
 I just, you know, and, um, and you actually stopped me and said, uh, babe, you, you actually
 went through that.
 I was like, babe, your first husband actually had an affair on you.
 and he divorced against your will.
 And you're like, oh yeah.
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
  </li><li>I totally forgot about that.
  </li><li>I haven't even thought about that.
 But I mean, yeah, I mean, to your point,
 kindness shows up in different ways, doesn't it?
  </li><li>Oh yeah, for sure.
 He's not limited in his affection.
  </li><li>Or his ability.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so sometimes even his kindness
 is that he keeps us from situations
 or that he redeems situations.
 And we're looking for,
 I think sometimes we're looking for something different because we're used to fun-sized
 candy and he wants to give us something so much better.
 And so we complain that we didn't get the fun-sized candy bar.
 Right.
 And he's like, are you joking?
 And not realizing he has a king-sized candy bar that he wants to give us.
 Right.
 I'm seeing a grief counselor at the moment.
 I've probably seen him like, I don't know, maybe five or six times.
 And it's really funny because in one sense, this is a completely artificial
 situation.
 Here I am going to speak to a complete stranger about intimate details of my
 and then of course he doesn't know me or my paradigm or my background and so we're having these
 interchanges and he was saying grief is a horrible thing in that grief never leaves you and I said to him I
 Don't think I have a worldview for that
 Like what do you mean that grief never leaves you?
 And he's like well
 It's just gonna accompany you for the rest of your life and I said I would hope not and he said what do you mean?
 I said, well, the story of my life for the Lord is that the Lord has been the great kinsman
 redeemer. And I mean, my cancels the Christian. So he knew what I meant by that. I said in that,
 the redemption of the Lord on my life has been that he's taken me from from where I have been
 to where I am now. And there's no trace of where I once was. And I actually used the story you just
 told to explain to him that you're not walking around limping from the effects of divorce. You're
 you're not struggling with the sadness of your first husband leaving you.
 Nope.
 Easy there.
 Sorry.
 I didn't say, but there's probably a time in the three years after he left where
 you were just thinking, how does this ever get better?
 Sure.
 Oh, in the eight years after he left, honestly, I, yeah, I, I was, it was
 incredibly painful, obviously.
 And there was, um, you know, God was talking a lot, but it didn't seem to
 change the circumstances.
 And now looking at what you know now, how would you
 minister to yourself back then?
 I would, I would probably encourage me to focus on the
 kindness of God.
 Like, I mean, I remember a couple of years after he
 laughed and I had sort of, I had felt like the Lord said, I'm
 going to restore this a different way.
 And I had told John and Carol and Carol said, well, I've been
 praying that God would bring your John, you know, because
 Carol had been married before and John had made before.
 And I remember thinking, gosh, that seems impossible.
 You know, it seems impossible that there would be somebody
 who would be such an incredible fit for me.
  </li><li>Right here, baby.
 I'm right here.
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause I kind of felt like I was used goods now,
 you know?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so then, I mean, now I look back and I'm like,
 wow, God, like, can you write a story or what?
 You know, like when you say you redeem,
 You redeem, you know, and I'm, I mean, I'm not thrilled.
 I went through that first situation.
 I would have loved to have bypassed that altogether and just waited for you.
 But, you know, I'm thrilled with what God has done.
 I think that the kindness of God is him revealing his true nature.
 You know, that versus us, he makes everything beautiful in his time.
 Yeah.
 And you know, and revelations is behold, I make all things new.
 I think that is the kindness of God being outworked in our life.
 Yeah.
 And I think sometimes when we're in difficult seasons of life,
 and I'm not suggesting for a minute that when the kinds of God manifests in your life
 that you're excused from difficult seasons, you're not.
 That's part of living in a fallen world.
 But part of the joy of living in a fallen world is being accompanied by a Savior
 who'll never leave us, never forsake us,
 and is constantly making everything beautiful in its time.
 Right.
 But sometimes, if we're not careful, we make pain or God,
 all at the expense of his kindness.
 Right.
 And we can't see the kindness because we've allowed our pain to endure.
 I think about when I had my breakdown, you know, when I was 21
 and I have this breakdown, I could not contemplate life getting better.
 I couldn't, which is, you know, why when you're in that state, you're driven
 to suicidal thoughts.
 You just can't think that life could be better.
 And I think, you know, all the efforts of my friends to encourage me,
 All the the the Psalms, all the promises in Scripture just felt like didn't make a dent on the steel trap that was round my mind.
 And I when I look back at what the Lord's done, it's not like the Lord has changed my life from that pit from that despair and put me back where I was before I fell into that pit.
 Right.
 Just slightly out of the pit.
 Right.
 It's inconceivable to me the quality of life that the Lord has given me, the joy, the endless enthusiasm, the abundant hope.
 I don't recognize the quality of life that I have to work hard.
 I've got my old journals to read and it feels like echoes of a season of life that I went through.
 I think about like when the Lord clears your debt, he doesn't return you back to zero.
 He actually gives you an inheritance.
 Right. And I'm sitting on 15 years of walked out testimony of the kindness of God,
 where it's hard for me to contemplate life without the goodness of God showing up.
 Like at any time I just close my eyes, I can feel the Lord Jesus sitting right next to me
 beside me. And the comfort of his presence is astonishing. I'm like, who's like that?
 You've got galaxies to run. You've got lives to orchestrate and yet you take time out of your schedule to sit and be with me.
 And the power of his presence is just unbelievable.
 Sometimes when we talk about the kindness of God, I think everybody thinks we're talking about the physical manifestations of his kindness, like the testimonies of gifts and things.
 Getting out of debt, gifts, houses, jobs, and all that sort of stuff.
 Those things feel like trinkets, not I'm ungrateful for them, compared to the internal strengthening of our spirits that he's done.
 Yeah.
 Like the kindness of God was manifest in my internal walk with him before it was ever manifest in external presence, so to speak.
 His internal presence with a C was the kindness of God before I ever had a grid for his external presence with a TS.
 You know, a lot of our testimony the last couple of years is about God doing amazing things,
 first-kind things. In many ways, extravagant generosity, Disney World houses and better houses,
 gifts and surprises, all those sorts of things. Those are amazing and I love them, but those aren't
 what I point to when I think about the kindness of God. They're certainly included. But I think
 the comfort, the kindness, the connection, the internal dialogue that I've had with the Lord.
 That's what I point to when I talk about the kindness of God.
 Yeah, that makes sense.
 I just wanted to clarify that. And unless people think I'm just purely talking about external
 things, it's absolutely included. But I just love him. He's just so amazing.
 I mean, it makes sense like when you think about it, if you think about it in terms of parents and
 and children, certainly part of kindness to your kids is that you buy them presents and
 you take them out for dinner and you know that kind of stuff.
 But the more important stuff is the cuddles in the morning and the you know just knowing
 what they like and what they don't like and what makes them excited and what doesn't
 in the dance parties and all the things that don't have a monetary value.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 that his kindness seems to be custom built to our hearts.
 Yeah.
 He speaks kindness to us in the ways we understand it.
 I remember when I met you, I met you as my teacher before I met you as my
 girlfriend.
 And you, you were very naughty student, just kidding.
 You confused me because I remember listening to your story.
 Like I had AJ taught our school on the father heart of God.
 It was five days straight Monday through Friday.
 And every day it seemed like the trauma got worse.
 Like you were telling your story.
 And on Monday, I was like, oh my gosh, how's anyone survive that?
 Then we get to Tuesday and I'm like, wait, there's more trauma.
 And then Wednesday.
 And I was like, I can't reconcile the person telling the story with the person in the story.
 Yeah.
 I've had people since then say to me, I don't believe your testimony because I don't
 know how it doesn't show on you.
 I remember leaning in and squilling my eyes and trying to work out.
 Not that I didn't believe you, but I was just like, I have never met anybody
 who so radiates health, wholeness and healing, whose life has been marked by
 such tragedy and destruction.
 Ah, how is this possible?
 And you know, you would tell stories about your rich and vibrant relationship
 with the father.
 And I was like, oh, this chick is acquainted with the kindness of God.
 You know, my story started with Graham Cook's testimony that totally inspired me.
 What was your story into the kindness of God?
 I would say it's difficult to separate my journey into the kindness of God from my
 journey into God's heart for me.
 Do you know what I mean?
 Cause I think it's all sort of intertwined.
 Um, so certainly showing up at TACF in 91 and, um, hearing that there was this
 wonderful father that I had no idea about.
 You know, and I've been saved for several years by then.
 And, you know, I had interspersed gone to church throughout my childhood.
 I mean, I mostly tried to hide until people gave up and left for church.
 And then I come out and play until they came home.
 But, um, you know, I, I, I didn't know, I didn't know about the father at all.
 And so after arriving at church, I spent sort of the first year and a half fighting
 the idea of a loving father. But there was this one moment on a Sunday morning and I think
 it was about a year and a half in and I was there was a guest speaker that morning and
 he said he was going to speak out of Leviticus or something and I was so excited because
 you know every single Sunday morning they were talking about the father heart of God
 you know the loving father and all this kind of stuff and I didn't I mean I was so wounded
 I didn't have a paradigm for that.
 You know, I didn't want to see God as a father because that word represented so much pain
 for me.
 And so I was excited we had guest speaker because I thought, well, finally I'm not going to
 hear a father message.
 This is amazing.
 You know, and then when he said, you know, turn to Leviticus and whatever, I can't even
 remember what he was speaking on healing, I think actually.
 I was just stoked.
 But somehow he even managed to bring it background to the kindness of God, you know, and how
 much he loves us and stuff. And I was just like, Oh, here we go again, you know. And
 um, but at the end, he asked people to stand up for prayer for, you know, healing or whatever.
 And I stood up because I just realized, you know what, everybody's so excited about this.
 And I'm, I'm really not. And so I want to be, but I don't even know what to do now.
 Like, I don't know how to get there.
 Was this you have an awake up call between the difference between knowledge and experience?
 Oh, I'm sure.
 Like, like, so you're saying, I look, I know that God is good.
 Why are you?
 Do you just not get it?
 Like, yes, well, I would mentally agree that it's in scripture, but I wouldn't say that I knew it.
 And it hadn't impacted your life.
 Not at all.
 Right.
 No.
 Um, I mean, I was still surviving every day was about survival.
 And so anyway, I remember standing up and he was praying for different things,
 but I just stood up and I said, Lord, I know that I don't understand what everybody's so
 excited about, but I really want to get it because it seems really important.
 And that was it.
 That's all I prayed.
 And that night I had a dream and it was super vivid.
 I've always been a dreamer anyway, but I mean, I still remember the dream just like I had it yesterday.
 And in this dream, I was running up to the father's house and I had a group of people with me.
 And they were all sort of behind me.
 And I got to the house first and I had a key.
 And so I opened the door and came inside.
 And right when you came in the front doors off to the right was this.
 Really warm, comfortable room.
 There was a big fire in the fireplace.
 You know, this thing was it looked like Dublin Castle.
 like it was a big mansion of a house.
 And it was this red room with all these couches
 and like snacks and board games and all this stuff.
 And so everybody ran in there
 and just started making themselves comfortable.
 And I remember thinking, guys, what are you doing?
 Like let's find him first.
 Like we need to find him and then we can be comfortable.
 Like then we can play with the stuff that he has for us,
 but let's find him.
 And everybody was like,
 "Oh, AJ, you're so intense."
 Which often people did say that to me,
 I was fairly intense.
 And so I just, well, I'm going, I'm gonna go find him.
 And my cousin was with me.
 And so her and my roommate and these two guys
 that were friends of ours ran with me.
 And we ran up, the first thing we did was run up
 this spiral staircase.
 And when we got to the top floor,
 I ran down the hallway.
 Now everything is black and white,
 except for that red room.
 Everything was black and white.
 And kind of covered in cobwebs,
 but I couldn't see cobwebs.
 Do you know what I mean?
 Like that kind of feeling.
 But I ran down the hallway and I ran off to the right
 and ran into this room.
 And I knew it was my room in the father's house.
 And as I ran in the room,
 I came into color.
 And it was bright yellow.
 And the only thing that was in the room,
 there wasn't a dress or anything,
 there was just this huge bed.
 And in the dream, I did like this cool ninja move
 where I jumped into the air and rotated mid air
 and landed on my back, you know,
 in the middle of the bed.
 And I was like, oh, you know, this is amazing.
 And I'm like, lying there.
 And I didn't know where the other four had gone off to.
 I didn't care, you know.
 And so I'm lying there.
 And I hear the Lord say, our hear a voice say,
 let the sun in.
 And I'm like, oh, let the sun in.
 So I jump down off the bed
 and I start throwing open the windows.
 So I throw open the windows in my room
 and I run out to the hallway
 and I run to the far end away from the spiral staircase
 and I throw open the window.
 And as I threw it open, what came in looked like,
 sort of liquid gold,
 like it came in on an angle.
 And it started just creeping up the walls.
 And as it did, all of a sudden everything came in a color.
 Like it was like this incredible wallpaper on the walls.
 And I mean, it just, it looked like a palace.
 And I was like, this is amazing.
 So as I ran back up the hallway,
 I started just throwing open all of the windows
 and all the different rooms.
 And so I saw my friends in different rooms and stuff
 and I just threw open the windows and I won't go into that part.
 But I then ran past the spiral staircase
 and up three stairs into the father's bedroom.
 And as I came in, I was like,
 oh, I've gotta get the window open
 'cause it was still sort of black and white.
 I could kind of see there was a bit of purple or blue,
 but I couldn't really see definition.
 And so I went over to the window and I couldn't reach it.
 It was so high, everything was so big in this room.
 It was like, I was like the smallest person, you know,
 as an aunt almost.
 And I actually, I would say it's like equivalent to our bed
 and having a two year old.
 You know, it's just like, I couldn't reach anything.
 And so I went over to the window and as I went over
 to the window and I realized I couldn't do anything,
 I was like, oh, I can't let this sun in.
 The window actually, the curtains came across,
 like by themselves and the window opened by itself.
 And all of a sudden there's light streaming in the room.
 And I was like, this is amazing.
 It was incredible, you know, blue and purple.
 It was just beautiful.
 And I went over and I stood at the end of the bed
 and even with my hands raised above my head,
 I only came to half the height of this bed.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>And I realized I have no hope of getting up there.
 There was like this veil around the bed
 and I thought there is no way I can get up there.
 And I remember just sitting there for a second
 and then I just reached up my hands and I said,
 up Papa. When I did that, it was like, you know how you pick up a little kid and you sort of toss
 them up onto a bed, you kind of, you know, flip them up onto a bed. I'm very familiar with that.
 I know you are. So that's what happened. All of a sudden I flipped up through the veil onto the bed
 and the father was on the bed. And I sat in the father's lap and he started laughing and I started
 laughing and then I woke up. And the first time that I had the dream, I could hear God
 audibly laughing in my bedroom for about 10 seconds. And I remember when I stopped hearing
 the sound just thinking, Oh God, you're real. And then my second thought was, and you're
 happy, you know, because I, I just really didn't know him at all. Right. I ended up having the
 exact same dream seven times.
 Over course of how long?
 But three years.
 You'd have that dream to
 exactly the same yet.
 Yeah.
 But I mean, it was.
 Yeah, it was remarkable.
 And in those three years, would you say that your concept of God
 and the kindness of God began to shift wide open?
 It was the steepest learning curve.
 I think I've ever experienced of anything in my life.
 I mean, from that moment, that was the morning that I woke up
 And after having the thought of you're real and you're happy, which, you know, God in my mind was angry and disappointed, you know,
 right, stern, distant, all the things that my dad was when I was a kid, right?
 And so I, the verse that went through my head once I sort of came back to, oh, wow, what just happened was that John 14 verse six,
 for I'm the way, the truth in the life.
 No man comes to the father but through me.
 And the thought that went through my head,
 and I think I probably had heard somebody
 make the statement, but I had never understood it,
 was in order for him to be a way,
 there must be a destination.
 Jesus says he's the way, and he's the way to what?
 He's the way to who?
 And I realized I was stuck on the way.
 So over the next three years, I would say,
 it was the steepest learning curve
 to understanding God's goodness and his kindness and his love for me. In three years, I mean,
 I would have said I was almost a completely different person.
 He's just relentless, isn't he? In his pursuit of making himself known.
 I remember the Lord saying in 2003, "I'm going to weary you with my kindness."
 And I thought about that verse. Remember when Peter, there'd been fishing all night,
 This happens twice in Peter's life and the Lord comes and they haven't caught a thing all night.
 And then the catch is so big that in one reading it begins to break the boats and they have to call
 over other boats. In one of the readings Peter says to him, "Go away from me Lord,
 from a sinful man." And I, when the Lord said, "I'm going to wear you with my kindness," I had
 that picture that actually his kindness is going to come so near to me that I'm going to have no
 paradigm for wise being that kind. Because this kindness isn't based on our performance.
 God hasn't been kind to Graham or God hasn't been kind to me because we're better Christian
 than other people. That's preposterous. He's been kind because that's who he is. I just
 see the traces of God's kindness everywhere in my life. Even thinking about losing my
 parents, I'm not saying losing my parents is the kindness of God. I don't mean that
 at all. I mean, in deep sorrow and in deep sadness, all the way through that journey with the Lord,
 the kindness of God is everywhere in it. And I just think, yeah, God, who are you? Like, what
 are you like? Like, is this your normal way of dealing with man? And I think it is honestly,
 I think a lot of us miss the kindness of God, because we have no landing strip for it.
 Oh, you know, we're, we're not expecting it.
 We don't know how to partner with him like that.
 And, and we're not looking for it.
 And again, often you only see what you're really looking for.
 That's so true.
 So I, I think even if you're listening today and you're like, that, that hasn't been my
 experience yet.
 You know, I haven't, I haven't known God's kindness in that way to, to maybe just let
 know, hey, I want to see your kindness. Would you show me your kindness? I want to experience
 your kindness. Would you help create a landing strip in which it could land in my heart and
 really take root? Because the Lord's no perspective of persons, you know, what he's done for Alan,
 what he's done for me, he wants to do for you. That's not up for debate. So it's more about,
 Hey, if you want that, then actually saying,
 Lord, I'm saying yes to learning about your kindness
 this year.
 Would you make 2018 the year of your kindness,
 that the year that it landed in your heart?
  </li><li>I think, I fully agree with that babe.
 I think if you're listening to this
 and perhaps you looked at the title
 and you were like the kindness of God,
 if you're aware that you have a knowledge of it,
 but not an experience of it,
 put yourself in that category.
 The number of things that God's done for me
 without me feeling passion for it is ridiculous.
 Like as in the number of things that God has answered
 when I've just cognitively said,
 "God, would you do this for me?"
 Without like, I'm thinking,
 "Oh, prayer's only work when there's like burden
 "or drivenness or an emotional conviction."
 No, prayer works according to your partnership,
 your verbal agreement.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So much of the things the Lord's done in my life
 has just been because I've shown up.
 There's been nothing really attached to it other than my will to put me to put me in
 a room or to ask God to do something.
 And so yeah, I look back on 15 years and just think, God, truly the kindness of God is the
 testimony of my life.
 Like God, what are you like?
 You're unbelievable.
 Yeah.
 And I also would say if you're saying yes to God and learning about kindness to also know
 that sometimes God in his kindness says no to some things because he has something better.
 And so if you can ask the Lord to help you understand his kindness, even when there's things
 that you don't understand, I think you'll get further along faster if that makes sense.
  </li><li>Why don't we pray for everybody who's listening?
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Lord Jesus, Lord, thank you for your kindness. You're so good. It borders on unbelievable.
 But our testimony has been you're as good as you promise you are. And Lord, I ask for everybody
 who's listening right now that you would begin to break into our lives, you would astonish us
 with your kindness, would you reveal a new facets, Lord, of your generosity, of your kindness.
 And would our testimony be that you have wearyed us with your kindness, Lord, that you have worn
 down our misunderstandings of you by your repeated deliberate undiluted acts of kindness.
 Lord, would you just manifest yourself in our lives, in our business, in our families
 while we sleep? Would you work on our behalf behind our backs without our knowledge?
 To orchestrate situations all designed to just magnify your kindness. Lord, I thank you that
 your kindness leads to repentance. Lord, I think of our loved ones who might not know who you are
 or what you're like, would you use your kindness to get their attention?
 Yeah. And Lord, if there's people who are listening to this, who think they're disqualified for
 whatever reason, Lord, I ask that you would arrest those thoughts right now and that you would
 just because you love us, just because of this is your nature, Lord, would you just reveal new
 levels of kindness to us in Jesus' name, Amen. Amen. All right. So there's our thoughts on the
 the kindness of God.
