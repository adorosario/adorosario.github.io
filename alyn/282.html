<p> I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones?<br/>
 Yes, sir.<br/>
 How the heck are you?<br/>
 I'm good.<br/>
 We're on episode 282 of Keeping Up With The Joneses.
 Welcome, everybody.<br/>
 Wow, is that?<br/>
 This week we're going to be talking about speaking in tongues.
 Yes.<br/>
 But before we do that, let's do our weekly catch up.
 OK.<br/>
<strong>[LAUGHS]</strong><br/>
 Wow.<br/>
 See, I feel like I cheat.<br/>
 Because I write the show notes, I already
 know what the weekly catch up is, but I have that same
 Glaket look, use the Scottish term.
</p><ul>
  <li>You probably look back through the calendar
 and figure out.
  </li><li>That's exactly what I do.
  </li><li>What we did, bid Kate's wedding.
  </li><li>Except I drove all the way out to Kate's wedding,
 looking particularly dapper I might add.
  </li><li>Yes, you looked very dapper.
  </li><li>And then immediately turned around and went home
 because my back.
  </li><li>Was out.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>And it was the same with church.
 Like I got ready for church that morning.
 I was thinking, "I can do this, I can do this,
 "this is fine, this is fine."
 And because it was a new injury, so long-time listeners
 will know that I have a disc that loves to go out.
 My L4 loves to subluxate.
  </li><li>Yes, it likes to go sideways.
  </li><li>Likes to pinch a nerve.
 And that's Siri and you can't move.
 This was a very different pain.
 And it turns out I had a twisted pelvis.
  </li><li>Well, it's all about dancing even doing it.
  </li><li>I thought break dancing would be fine at age 47,
 but apparently-- - Yeah, apparently.
  </li><li>Not good. - We're not.
  </li><li>But thank you to Dr. Ronson, our chiropractor.
 My back got fixed fairly rapidly.
 four chiropractic visits in as many days, twice on the decompression table.
 Yeah.
 And I got you sorted.
 I'm almost all better.
 I know some still leaning a little bit tiny bit.
 Yeah.
 But I don't know why my pelvis keeps getting twisted.
 I just assume you're leaning towards me because you want to be with me.
 But you know,
 tick update.
 Yes.
 My tick had no diseases.
 Good.
 I heard back from tickcheck.com and they're like, you're good.
 I stopped my antibiotics immediately.
 Praise God.
 But I heard from a listener this week.
 Yeah. Who was listening to our episode and only got as far as the weekly update where we were talking about our tick or my tick.
 And went in and found a tick on themselves and because they'd listened to our podcast, they knew exactly what to do and they too sent off their tick.
 So tick check. So we're trying to like, you know, we're just like public health.
 Big events that happened this week.
 Our kids are out of school.
 Maybe I'm just helping you jog your memory.
 They are, wow, that was this week.
  </li><li>That was this week.
  </li><li>And they all did killer good with their grades.
  </li><li>They really did.
  </li><li>Knocked it out of the park, all three of them.
  </li><li>Yep, so proud of them.
  </li><li>We went to Bartaco, didn't we?
  </li><li>We did, I forgot how much I love that place.
  </li><li>Me too.
  </li><li>The trouble is, I was wearing a blue and white checked shirt
 and so that's what everybody who works there wears.
 So I was worried that when I took MJ to the restroom
 that people were gonna stop and ask for a refill or something.
 But food was amazing.
 Your favorite taco that you had there?
  </li><li>I liked the oyster one.
  </li><li>I never had that.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>I had the pork belly, which was delicious.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Do you see pork bellies too salty for me?
  </li><li>Oh, it's all the sweet.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Oh, and I loved to go out.
 In fact, I kind of want to go there tonight.
  </li><li>We can't.
  </li><li>We already have food for it.
  </li><li>Food, food.
 I have food ready.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>Yup.
  </li><li>Our pool, our neighborhood pool is open.
  </li><li>It is?
  </li><li>Memorial day weekend for Americans.
 I hope you have a great Memorial Day Monday.
 We plan on grilling out, probably going to the pool.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So life is good.
  </li><li>It is.
  </li><li>And anything else outstanding happened this week?
 I can't believe this wasn't top of your list.
 Where did you and I go yesterday?
  </li><li>Oh, we went to the movies.
 We did go to the movies.
  </li><li>What did we go see?
  </li><li>We saw Top Gun Maverick.
  </li><li>What did you think?
  </li><li>I thought it was great.
 It was so nostalgic of the first one.
 There were so many moments where they tied it in brilliantly,
 either with music or different scenes.
 I loved it. I thought it was great.
  </li><li>When did the first one come out?
  </li><li>Oh, I don't even know.
  </li><li>1985 or something?
  </li><li>Yeah, it had to be '80s, 'cause I think I was in high school.
  </li><li>IMDB, 1986 is when it came out.
  </li><li>'86.
  </li><li>So I was 12 when that came out.
  </li><li>You were just a youngin.
 Here's what was horrible for me about watching the movie, which I really enjoyed.
 I mean, it's exactly what you think it will be.
 Yeah.
 What I really struggled with is the existential crisis of we're all getting old
 and we're all going to die watching the movie.
 You struggled with that?
 Yes, because a 12 year old.
 Because Tom Cruise is getting old.
 Tom Cruise isn't getting old.
 Tom Cruise is cryogenically frozen in time.
 I know.
 Val Kilmer.
 Val Kilmer looked old.
 Yeah.
 And Ed Harris.
 -Yes. -Yes.
 -I was just thinking, "Man, life moves on."
 -Yes. -And I didn't get any younger.
 -Yes. -It was kind of sobering.
 I had a bit of a mid-life crisis in the middle of the movie.
 -Well. -Then was The Strats by Fighter J.
 I was like, "Meow."
 -I thought it was interesting.
 We watched a little mini documentary on how
 Tom Cruise had all the actors
 actually had to do all this flight stuff to get ready for it,
 because they are actually filming inside of planes.
 -Yes.
 I found it interesting that they paid $11,000 an hour for each plane of screen time.
 And Tom Cruise, even though he is a pilot and is allowed to fly many, many different planes,
 was forbidden from flying or touching the controls because they're military and there's a rule
 where non-military people are not allowed to touch the controls. That must be really difficult for him
 because he's a pilot nerd. I heard him say... And he seems to like to do all of his own things,
 so I'm not surprised. I heard him say the Top Gun to this movie or Top Gun Maverick,
 whatever it was called, is a love letter to aviation.
 And boy, is that true.
  </li><li>It seems that way, yeah, for sure.
  </li><li>All right, loved it.
 Great date, Knight.
  </li><li>So good.
  </li><li>For people our age.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Well, I think it's a good standalone movie on its own.
 I don't know, how could we know?
 'Cause we have the background, but.
  </li><li>Our main topic this week.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Is all about speaking in tongues.
  </li><li>Perfect.
  </li><li>Last week we talked about baptism, the Holy Spirit.
 And during that episode, we talked a little bit
 about speaking in tongues.
 I think I halted you 'cause I was like,
 Oh no, this is a new episode that we could talk about.
 I have to tell you that I'm going to wander a little bit
 as I talk about speaking tongues, biblically.
 And what I mean by that is--
 Ooh, biblical wandering.
 Well, I was raised a conservative evangelical
 in a sensational background.
 Nope. (laughs)
 It was fabulous, I tell you.
 You found fabulous.
 That was so good.
 Any cessationist background.
 There you go.
 The cessationists are people who don't believe in the gifts of the Holy Spirit for today,
 so they don't believe speaking in tongues for today.
 Things like prophecy, healing, all that sort of stuff doesn't happen.
 Did happen in the Bible times, but now the Bible is complete.
 Doesn't need to happen now.
 Right.
 That's what I was raised in.
 Yeah.
 But then I met the Holy Spirit and got baptized in the Holy Spirit.
 That kind of changes your perspective.
 I've still changed my perspective.
 And I've spent most of my life now in charismatic churches, charismatic being people who believe
 in the act of working the charisma gifts that the power of the Holy Spirit.
 So I know from having lived in both those camps that depending on which end of that spectrum
 you are on, you'll read the verses that I'm actually going to share on this episode and
 come to different conclusions because you're looking through different lenses.
 And I want to be theologically honest enough to say that I could actually argue either
 interpretation of some of these verses, which is dangerous because then what you're doing
 is you're making these verses say what you want them to say rather than discovering what
 they are saying.
 Right.
 So I want to be honest about that.
 And I'll add commentary when that happens.
 Okay.
 The reason I'm doing that is if I've got people who are not of a charismatic persuasion listening
 to this because maybe a friend's like, Hey, I'm listening to this episode or I've got
 people who are like, "I listened to this episode and maybe you're a pastor thinking,
 'What, hang on, I want to listen to what these people are saying.' I actually just want to
 have enough academic or, not even academics, you know, theological honesty to say, 'Yeah,
 I could see why people in this camp believe this first means this and comment on that.
 Am I going a little bit to the extra lengths or is that just the way I'm wired?'
 Well, it's kind of the way you're wired, baby, so I'm all good.
 So I have a bunch of questions and before I even tell you what the questions are and then
 offer answers to them. I thought it would be good if we read a bunch of verses that we can then refer
 back to when attempting to answer those questions. Sounds good. Can you read a very famous verse?
 Yes. Or a very famous series of verses from the day of Pentecost. Acts chapter 2, take it way
 age of Jones. Okay. Acts chapter 2, starting at verse 2, suddenly a sound like the blowing of a
 violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. They saw what
 seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. All of them were
 filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.
 Now there were staying in Jerusalem God fearing Jews from every nation under heaven
 and when they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment because each one heard
 their own language being spoken. Utterly amazed, they asked, aren't all these who are speaking
 Galileans? Then how is it each of us hears them in our native language? Parthians, Medes, and Alomites?
 residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia. Wow, Pontus and Asia. Five, how do you say that one?
 Easy for you to say. Yeah, those two that start with a P Egypt and parts of Libya near Cyrene,
 visitors from Rome, both Jews and converts to Judaism. Cretians and Arabs, I'm going to get
 get you back for making me read this verse. We hear them declaring the wonders of God in
 our own tongues. Amazed and perplexed. They asked one another, "What does this mean?"
 I'm so glad that you took that passage. Oh my gosh. If I thought ahead, I would have
 been like, "No, I'm not doing it." All right. I want to read another passage. 1 Corinthians
 14. Again, famous passage here. Verse 1, "Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts to
 the Spirit, especially prophecy. For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people,
 but to God. Indeed, no one understands them. They utter mysteries by the Spirit. Verse
 four says, "Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves, but the one who prophesies
 edifies the church. I would like every one of you to speak in tongues."
 Romans 8, 26 and 27. The Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought
 to pray for, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us through wordless groans, and He who
 searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for
 God's people in accordance with the will of God.
 Ephesians 6, 18 says, "Praying at all times in the Spirit with all prayer and supplication."
 Jude 20 and 21, but you dear friends,
 by building yourselves up in your most holy faith
 and praying in the Holy Spirit,
 keep yourselves and God's love
 as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ
 to bring you to eternal life.
  </li><li>Bunch of verses there for us.
 I'll put all the links to those verses
 in the show notes as normal.
 Let me ask you some questions, AJ Jones.
  </li><li>Oh dear, okay, I'm ready.
 No, you know the answers to these.
  </li><li>Okay, good.
  </li><li>It's not like I'm asking you math questions.
  </li><li>Okay, good.
  </li><li>I'm pretty good at math, actually.
  </li><li>You are very good at math.
 Especially at mental arithmetic.
  </li><li>I am.
  </li><li>I find that amusing that I studied math,
 I mean, I say I studied math at university.
 I did it for like three weeks and then realized,
 what am I doing?
 I need to swap subjects.
 I'm going to die. - Oh, I thought
 you did a whole year.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>I was wondering how you studied math at university.
  </li><li>Nope, I got accepted for math
 and that very quickly realized,
 what I'm out of my depth here
  </li><li>It's switched to something different.
  </li><li>That makes so much more sense.
 Okay, I'm with you.
 Because it's not just mental arithmetic.
 It's like when we look at a spreadsheet and you're like,
 yeah, that totally makes sense.
 And I'm like, no, there's something horribly wrong
 with these numbers.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Yeah.
  </li><li>No, that's true. - Yeah.
 It's okay.
  </li><li>All right, back to tongues. - Back to tongues.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>So what is speaking in tongues?
  </li><li>Speaking in tongues is a spiritual gift
 where you are allowing the Holy Spirit to pray through you.
  </li><li>I love that it's a gift
 because it makes everything else easier.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like speaking tongues is not a mark of spiritual maturity.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>Because gifts don't indicate maturity.
 Fruit does.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So it's a gift, so you can't even earn it.
 It's a gift.
  </li><li>Right.
 You know, we read 1 Corinthians 14 verse one,
 where Paul says, "Follow the way of love
 and eagerly desire gifts for the spirit."
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So that's a command.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like we are to eagerly desire gifts for the spirit.
 And then Paul goes on, he talks about prophecy
 and tongues, which are both spiritual gifts.
 But and he implores everyone to desire prophecy, but he also says he wants everyone to speak in tongues.
 Wow.
 Want to make a comment here?
 Yeah.
 This is just my understanding of the text.
 Right.
 So I want to kind of make that clear.
 I this would be my this would be my understanding.
 It might not be my doctrine.
 And I'll explain why in a second.
 I think every Christian can like it has the potential to both speak in tongues and prophesy.
 Yes.
 And I know their gift.
 And it's my understanding because I think as Paul writes here,
 under the direction of the Holy Spirit, by the way,
 that he tells us all to desire those things, tongues and prophecy and other gifts.
 And it's most like the Father, as the Psalmist says in Psalm 145,
 you know, where says God opens his hand and satisfies the desires of every living thing.
 Like it's outside of a good father's nature to say,
 Hey, you guys really, really, really, really desire this thing.
 These things I've commanded you to, but ha ha, you're not going to get it.
 That's right.
 Right. So I think because it's there, as like, eagerly desire these things, we are to eagerly desire them.
 And he would love to give us it.
 The reason I say it's not my doctrine is because I'm aware in saying what I just said, that it might cause her or sadness.
 Or I might inadvertently end up with people who think they're second class Christians, because I know of many devoted Christians who do not speak in tongue.
 Yes.
 Tongues.
 They speak in tongue, but not in tongues.
 Right. And it's not for the one of desiring it. And so I don't want to add an extra burden to them. They're like, what's wrong with you? You know, everybody can.
 Right.
 Having said that, though, I also have a working theory of perhaps why, which I'll talk about later. Again, based on my experience, which is why I don't make it my doctrine, but it is my considered opinion.
 True theory.
 That's what I told you. There'd be a little bit of wandering in this episode.
 Okay. I'm ready.
 All right, so it's a spiritual gift.
 It's given freely by the Holy Spirit to, to, I believe all believers.
 All right.
 Where is it in the Bible?
 Well, we just read a bunch of them.
 Check the show notes for the links.
 When I was thinking about the benefits, baby, I came up with four benefits of speaking in tongues.
 Of course you did.
 Did you rhyme them all like with the same starting with the same letter or something?
 I did not.
 That's Baptist.
 Remember I wasn't about to just read it.
 OK, could you try and make them all start with the letter P or something?
 No.
 OK.
 The four benefits I thought of and see if you've got any more is one,
 edification, yes, two intercession, yes, three worship, yes, four evangelism.
 Yes, but what?
 What about five strengthening?
 Cause it strengthens you and your inner man, right?
 That was number one, edification.
 Oh, edification, I suppose that is strengthening.
 I guess I think of edification differently.
 I see.
 I should have gone through and explained them.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 That's where I, that was my mistake.
 Right.
 Number one.
  </li><li>Dedification. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Edification is literally a spiritual strength thing,
 or a building yourself up.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So that verse that you read in Jude 20,
 but you dear friends, - Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>By building yourself up in your most holy faith,
 and praying in the Holy Spirit.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Or 1 Corinthians 14, verse four, I read that,
 like anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Now, let me comment,
 because my cessationist lens,
 from when I was growing up,
 I never read Jude 20
 as praying in the Holy Spirit as praying in tongues.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Now, I think we have a precedent for Jude 20 being tongues
 because of 1 Corinthians 14 verse four.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Right? Because 1 Corinthians 14 verse four says,
 you edify yourself by speaking tongues.
 And in Jude 20, he's talking about building yourself up
 by praying in the Holy Spirit.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>The church culture I grew up in,
 we would just think praying in the Holy Spirit
 would be like being led by the Holy Spirit
 to pray in English.
  </li><li>All right, got you.
  </li><li>All right.
 Now with my charismatic eyes, I would say that is speaking in tongues.
 Yes.
 I don't care too much to have that distinction made or forced.
 Yes.
 But I'm just explaining that for.
 OK, I got you.
 You know, again, I want to be sensitive to our listeners.
 I don't know where you're from.
 I don't know what your spiritual background is trying to be as helpful as possible.
 Straight up heat then over here.
 Not much of a background.
 Well, I would say charismatic.
 He's in, you know, you did it with gusto.
 Absolutely.
 So that's edification or building yourself up.
 Like often when I'm needing revelation, when I'm needing,
 well, actually we should have put revelation there as number five,
 because I'm not sure if that's the same as edification.
 I don't think so. Anyway.
 Often when I speak in tongues, it feels like spiritual antennas going up
 and I become more aware of what the Holy Spirit's doing.
 Yeah, much more connected.
 So that's what kind of that's a little bit of a edification and revelation thing.
 All right.
 Intercession.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 This is what Paul's talking about.
 Rome's 826.
 The spirit helps us in our weakness.
 We do not know what we ought to pray for,
 but the spirit himself intercedes for us
 through wordless groans.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Similarly, in the verse we read in Ephesians 6,
 verse 18, praying all times in the spirit,
 there's that phrase again, with all prayer and supplication.
 I had to look up supplication,
 'cause it was one of those Christian words
 I've used my whole life,
 and I'm not entirely sure what it means.
  </li><li>Well, you're a good company,
 'cause apparently I don't know what edification means.
 (laughs)
 Go ahead.
  </li><li>Supplication is just the act of asking
 for something earnestly.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Now, I don't know if I need a trauma warning here,
 but I'm gonna talk about recent events in American news.
 So in the last couple of weeks,
 we've had two mass shootings in America.
 Both horrible and tragic.
 One in New York where 10 members of the black community
 were murdered by a white supremacist,
 who specifically chose that location.
 Because of it's, and drove, I don't know,
 like two hours to get there specifically.
 And then one this week, we're 19 elementary,
 that's primary school children,
 and two adults were murdered in another mass shooting.
 When I hear the news of both of those events,
 I am instantly overwhelmed.
 Like I feel like I'm drowning,
 both emotionally and spiritually.
 Like I can start a list of things I want to pray for,
 but then I just feel lost.
 And on the horizon, I'm just waiting for the beverage
 of unhelpful comments or responses that I'm going to see.
 This for me is where praying in the spirit is huge.
 Like when I don't know what to pray for, I pray in tongues.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>That would be my intercession.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Sundays, you know, we were praying for the war in Ukraine
 and we were praying about the news of the Supreme Court
 overturning abortion and we were praying our church
 for the shooting in Buffalo.
 And again, you know, we all split into,
 I don't know what to pray.
 I'm just like, yeah, of course I know what to pray,
 but I also, there's an element of me that just doesn't.
 And so I just start praying in tongues.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Do you have a praying in tongues story, baby?
  </li><li>Well, I think, I don't know if it's a praying in tongues
 story, but I'm just thinking a number of years ago,
 like, you know, when something went, what happened?
 You'd think, oh, I never prayed for this.
 You know, I never asked for this.
 And then I'd have the thought go through my head,
 believe I don't, I actually know what I'm saying
 when I'm praying in tongues.
 So maybe I did, like maybe I prayed, God, refine me.
 or whatever.
  </li><li>Lord, crucify my flesh.
  </li><li>So you're just like,
 well, it's kind of a dangerous past time to bring in tongues.
 But anyway, yes, that's what I was thinking about.
  </li><li>All right, that's number two, intersection.
 Number three, worship.
 This might shock you.
  </li><li>I doubt it.
  </li><li>I love singing in tongues.
 It's one of my favorite things to do.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>Yeah, I knew it shocked.
 In fact, my discipline used to be,
 before I ever met you,
 and when I had a piano, which I don't currently have,
 I'd come home from work,
 I'd sit down at my piano and I would just play and sing in tongues until I couldn't sit up anymore
 because the Holy Spirit would come and I'd get knocked to the floor.
 And we need to get you a piano.
 One of my most played songs, you know, if I look in, it's not called iTunes anymore,
 but if I look in my Apple Music Library, one of the most played tracks ever is a spontaneous
 track that we recorded One Night at Grey Center.
 Yeah.
 Right?
 The fabulous Jesse Early.
 Yes.
 inch and the incomparable Chris McLaurney all started playing.
 And you know, for a large portion of the song, they're just singing in tongues.
 Yeah.
 And I just, I love it.
 I put it on and it's not like I sing along with the tongues that they're
 singing in. I sing along in my tongue.
 And I'll put a link in the show.
 And so if you haven't heard it, it's such a great track.
 You can listen to it.
 You can download it as well.
 But I guess I said last week, when we're recording, I, I didn't even
 start speaking in tongues, I started with with singing in tongues. And probably that's most often,
 if if I am, you know, praying in tongues, I'm probably singing more than I'm than I'm speaking.
 So the only time I hear you speaking tongues is our kids went through a season where when we'd
 put them to bed, they didn't want us to pray in English. They wanted us to pray in tongues.
 Yeah.
 So we'd come into their bedroom and we'd pray in tongues over them.
 Yeah.
 And if we tried to pray in English, they'd be like, no, we want tongues.
 Why should you pray in tongues?
 And we actually had to start warning any sitters that they would ask that you
 would pray in tongues.
 Remember when they asked your dad if he would bring my cessationist father?
 Who was babysitting one night?
 And one of the kids just didn't know not to ask grandpa that, but they're like, no,
 not in English grandpa in tongues.
 Yeah.
 I don't think he ever said anything to do.
 Um, I know he just mentioned that they had asked.
 Yeah.
 Oh gosh.
 He didn't further comment.
 He just said, you MJ just asked me to pray in tongues when I put into bed.
 I just prayed.
 Like, okay.
 Great.
 Good job.
 Thanks so much.
 I forgot about that.
 Oh, I was a massive babes.
 I love it.
 The final one.
 Yes.
 Unless we want to add anymore is evangelism.
 Yeah.
 And Acts 2, again, here's my theological wandering. Some theologians like to make a distinction between
 the supernatural gift of tongues that is actually another language that you didn't learn,
 which is what we see in Acts 2. Right. And a heavenly language that is spiritual in nature
 and not understood by man. Right. And we get that from 1 Corinthians 14 verse 2. Sure.
 I'm not so eager to make that distinction because I'm not sure that's actually what's going on in
 acts to. And I know of people who've been speaking in tongues, like IE, their prayer
 language. And it's actually a language to other people, but it wasn't a language to
 them. I've heard numerous stories of that. Do you have a story?
 I was just thinking about, I don't know if you were there, but this was during the revival
 in Toronto.
 Is this Al Mcdonald?
 Yeah.
 Al Mcdonald.
 Yeah.
 Al Mcdonald.
 And, you know, he was speaking in a different tongue than what he normally speaks in.
 So he was, you know, I mean, the Holy Spirit was just doing wild stuff and John was walking
 around with a microphone, miking different people.
 And it sounded like some sort of, you know, Oriental Asian language.
 And so John went over and miked Al and all of a sudden this group of like 40, I think
 they were Koreans, but they might have been Japanese.
 It was a group that all came together.
 All just started freaking out and came up to the front and basically they had come to
 see if this was God.
 And Al was saying in their language, this is God.
 and then started talking about how big
 and how wonderful God is.
 And so this whole group of 40 people
 just came up to the front and were freaking out.
 And Al is this little, like, unassuming white guy,
 you know, who's like in his 80s that's, you know,
 yelling at the top of his lungs in some different tongue.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Yeah, he had no idea what was going on.
 Anyway, it was just super cool.
 Yeah, it's one of my favorite memories
 of watching something like that happen.
  </li><li>Spontaneously.
 I'm going to add in number five.
 I'm going to add in revelation.
 I'm adding number five.
 Because I remember when I learned to prophesy,
 the only way I would get prophetic revelation was by speaking tongues.
 Like when I started and I would lay hands on people,
 if I would speak in tongues, then I would get revelation for them.
 Oh, that's interesting.
 Now, I don't know if one preceded the other or it was just like,
 you know, scaffolding and baby steps for me.
 Yeah.
 But often, often when we're in meetings, I don't know if you can pray in tongues in your head,
 but often I'm praying and I'm just asking the Lord for revelation,
 and I will get stuff that I didn't have because I've been praying in tongues.
 That's interesting. I like it.
 Mm. One of my favorite books on this topic is by Mahash Chavdas called "The Hidden Power of Prayer
 and Fasting." And again, one of those books is just you'll read stories in there that are almost
 too supernatural to be believed. And it was a huge encouragement. If you want to learn more
 about speaking in tongues, I would encourage you to read that book.
 Sounds good.
 Last question, A.J. Jones.
 Yeah.
 How do you get tongues?
 You ask for it.
 Yeah. Similar to baptism of the Holy Spirit, like it can happen sovereignly.
 Yeah.
 Or it's, you know, someone prays for you.
 Yeah.
 But here's the deal. I don't think that's enough.
 Okay.
 What I mean by that is, I believe I got the gift of tongues months before I ever used the gift of tongues.
 Okay.
 Like, I believe when I got baptized in the Holy Spirit that I could have spoken in tongues that night,
 it's just that nobody told me how to activate it.
 Right.
 And so here's where I tell some humiliating stories about my own ignorance.
 That about a left brainer trying to stumble into things of the Spirit.
 But I think part of my confusion about speaking in tongues is I'd read fantastical books or testimonies.
 I don't mean fantastical as in their fictitious,
 I've just been like larger than life stories were.
 You know, I remember reading this one story
 about a missionary woman who didn't speak in tongues,
 who was in a foreign country and her life is in danger.
 And she just felt, she said I felt like a rush of wind
 come from the back of my head and out my mouth
 and I could hear myself saying things
 in a language I'd never heard.
 And I got rid of the attackers
 and that's how she learned to speak in tongues.
 And it would seem like most of the stories I'd read
 were this kind of dramatic where the Holy Spirit came on you.
 and you had no choice, but the Holy Spirit would start speaking through you.
 Yeah.
 And I think that was my misnomer.
 That was my confusion because I used to, and I know you have no problem believing this.
 As part of my daily discipline, you know, I'd read my Bible, I would pray.
 And then I would wait with my mouth open and my tongue hanging out for the Holy Spirit to move my tongue.
 I love you so much because I had nobody to teach me.
 And I was just so eager and keen that I just said it like this.
 Oh, I was just like, how long do I wait for?
 You know, and then all the saliva would disappear and I just like, okay, this, this can't be it.
 And then I did, I remember I had a friend pray for me and he was not aggressive at all.
 But okay, this is another humiliating story.
 I forget what it was, but this person prayed for me and he prayed for the baptism of Holy Spirit.
 And he prayed for me to be able to speak in tongues and he tried to coach me.
 And he's oh, I remember exactly the word and he just said okay
 So I'm gonna pray for you a holy spirit which would come just fill Alan right now
 Which you give him the gift of tongues and he just said to me okay Alan just say the first word that comes in your head
 So the first word that came out of my head was egg yolk
 So I just said egg yolk. He's like yeah, maybe try again
 And because his experience was somebody prayed for him and when a word popped in his head
 He just said that word and for him when he said that word, everything got kickstarted. Right?
 So I think I tried again and
 No, I think I was so humiliated
 I didn't try again and later that night after he'd left and I was on my own
 I I forget the word but I had one word that wasn't English and I forget what it was
 It wasn't Shaba, but it may as well have been right it was our word
 That a two syllable word yeah that I would just take out for a spin every now and then and I wasn't quite sure why I would
 But I continue to pray for the gifts of tongues and one day I forget how many months after this event
 But I'm praying and I'm asking Lord for the gift of tongues
 And I feel like the Holy Spirit says to me
 Alan for you to ask me for the gift of tongues would presuppose that you don't have it and I would be that's correct
 And you said if you don't have it then why do you keep saying this one word?
 Right, which wasn't Shaba, but it may as well have been.
 Right, right.
 And I was like, you mean this is that?
 And I felt like the Holy Spirit said, yes, you just need to grow your vocabulary.
 So now rather than saying that one word out of awkwardness, I said that one word out of
 faith, and that's what kick started me speaking in tongues.
 That's so cool.
 Here's the thing that I wished someone would have done when I was learning to speak in tongues
 is they'd let me know what speaking tongues sounded like.
 So I'm going to speak in tongues just now, right?
 We're not in a church service,
 so we don't need an interpretation.
 For those of you like, wait, are you like to do that?
 Here's what I learned about speaking tongues is,
 speaking in tongues is like speaking in English.
 And what I mean by that is,
 I used to think the speaking in tongues
 was the sovereign thing that the Holy Spirit
 would fall upon me and all of a sudden uncontrollably,
 I'd start saying things, no,
 just like I can choose to start speaking in English.
 Father, I thank you for this day.
 I thank you for the people who are listening to this podcast.
 I ask that you'd bless them.
 Just like I can choose to start and stop speaking in English,
 I can choose to start speaking in tongues,
 shabratala rakabohobriyatein,
 nakabarahabriyate, larakabahamriyatala rakabohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakobohorakoboh
 I can also choose to stop speaking in tongues.
 And the other thing is I don't have to think about what I'm going to say.
 Like I'm not like speaking in tongues and thinking, "Oh, I've said that phrase a bit
 too much.
 I'll bear it."
 I don't know.
 I'll vowel sound like that's not what's happening when I'm speaking in tongues.
 Do you want to know the nerdy way that I convinced myself of speaking in tongues and not making
 Yeah, I do. I don't think you've ever told me some of this up. This is quite interesting.
 Is one day while having breakfast, I picked up the back of a cereal box and I spoke in tongues,
 but I read in my mind the ingredient list of the back of the cornflakes box.
 Yes.
 And I was amazed that I could both simultaneously speak audibly in one language and read in English
 fluently. Then to make sure that my thesis was sound, I started trying to speak in English and try
 and read at the same time, and I realized I couldn't do both at the same time.
 Oh, that's so funny.
 And therefore I realized it was two different brain functions, and that's what settled for me
 I was speaking in tongues.
 Oh my gosh, I love that.
 It is a left-brainers' guide to speaking in tongues.
 There you go.
 How did you learn or not learn because it was a gift, but how did you know
 that you could speak in tongues because you had lots of well-meaning Pentecostals around you saying
 yeah say shit about a Honda yeah and so much pressure I don't know I started I started singing
 that day and I think I had like one little phrase basically and you know Mary Audrey being this
 sweet woman that she is just like that's it keep going keep going you're doing and I just kept
 singing that one thing over and over again. And it's funny because for a season I had a
 tongue that sounded completely different for about three or four years. And then I stopped
 speaking that tongue and went back to the first one. So I, you know, and I don't know what that
 was about, but yeah.
 So you learned to sing first. You were the other question I had about singing tongues is,
 how do you know where the music's going to go? Like often at Grey Centre will play spontaneously.
 Yeah, we the band will play spontaneously. I do not do any playing, but you know, the band will play.
 And how do you know where you're going to sing like both? I know how you know the words that you're going to sing as you're singing tongues, but how do you know the melody?
 Well, there was no music. So I was just the melody was part of it.
 Oh, really? Yeah. So you're a cappella singing tongue. Yeah, way to overachieve on your first time.
 Well, I was just doing what she told me to do.
 And because I trusted her and it didn't feel the same as all the other times when I had felt like
 this incredible pressure to perform, it turned out okay.
 That's great.
 I think it would be irresponsible of us to talk about speaking tongues without also praying for
 our listeners to receive the gift of tongues.
 So I'm going to do that just now.
 age is having an allergy attack where it sounds like snot is running as kidnapped you is that right it's yeah it's like blocking up the back of my nose.
 That's not fun father i thank you.
 You're good father that you love to give good gifts to your children and i thank you for this wonderful gift in many ways is a mystery it in so many ways is offensive to the rational mind.
 and yet is a gift and we know from scripture lord that we're both to eagerly desire it and as
 paul said lord that your eager lord that everybody would be able to speak in tongues and so i ask
 right now lord that because it's a gift that you would just give a gift of speaking in tongues
 to everybody who's listening right now lord that that you right now holy spirit would fall upon
 people and that you would give them that gift so that they can use that gift lord for edification
 for intercession, for worship, Lord, maybe evangelism and for revelation.
 And I want to encourage you, like you, nobody's around, well, I don't know where you're
 listening to this, but when nobody's around, you can, you can have someone pray for you,
 but you need to take it out for spin and you need to step out.
 And for me, the way it worked for me, you heard that is I just had one phrase, I, I
 heard a phrase and it can feel like folly to say something.
 It feels like you're making things up.
 But as with everything in the spirit,
 you need childlike faith.
 When you pray, it feels like,
 when you first start praying,
 and even in English, it feels like you're speaking to nothing.
 When you start prophesying,
 you're convinced you're making it up.
 When you start praying for healing,
 you realize that you're utterly powerless,
 and so is to with speaking in tongues.
 And so I wanna encourage you,
 just ask for a word,
 and whatever word pops in your head,
 say that and see what happens. Now, we would love to hear from you. If you've got questions
 about speaking tongues, if you've got testimonies about speaking tongues, if you've got some crazy
 tongue speaking stories, we'd love to hear about them. Send them to us. You can send an email to us
 hello, Alan and AJ.com. We'd love to hear about that. And I forgot to mention talking about like
 tongues, we had our dear friend pass a surprise come on the podcast. And I don't know how many
 languages he speaks. 16? I thought it was 17, but yeah, somewhere there. 17 languages, 16 of
 which have been given to him supernaturally by God, including English, where he can not only speak
 English fluently, but also write it and read it. Amazing. So I'll put a link to that in the show
 notes too. Okay, the risk of drowning my wife in her own start. I have a listeners question for you.
 Oh dear. Yep. This is from Sweet Hillary, one of our members. Hi, Sweet Hillary.
 And she asked a question about baptism, the Holy Spirit. She said this, I've got two questions. Number
 one, do you think the baptism, the Holy Spirit is like water baptism in that you can get baptized
 more than once? I'll go ahead and say, yes, because we leak. So we need to be filled by the Holy Spirit.
 And you see that with disciples in Acts two, they get filled with the Holy Spirit. But in Acts four,
 Peter and the disciples, they're praying again, because they just had this confrontation,
 and they're feeling like they need more of God's presence.
 And it says in Acts 4 verse 31,
 "And when they had prayed, the place where they had gathered together was shaken,
 and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness."
 What's crazy is they were already previously filled in Acts 2.
 Acts 2 verse 4 says, "They were all filled with the Holy Spirit."
 So I think whether you want to call it a filling of the Holy Spirit,
 baptism of the Holy Spirit, I think, yes, just go for it.
 like there are no toxic limits to the Holy Spirit.
 So get as much filling as you possibly can.
 Got question one.
 Question number two, in the verse I heard you mentioned from Matthew 11,
 "I baptize you with water for repentance, but after me comes one who is more powerful than I,
 he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
 Are those the same baptism or is there another baptism?
 That's fire.
 What do you think, Adrijans?
 That's such a good question.
 I guess I've always thought it's the same.
 I think because of the fire, like the tongues and fire appearing in Acts 2, I've always
 thought that that's like one baptism together, the Holy Spirit and fire.
 Again, you know, depending on which lens I'm wearing from my cessationist background,
 which they probably dodged the first one of being baptized and being slightly facetious.
 Although in all seriousness, I once heard a preacher, I respect a cessationist preach
 about Acts 2 and how he translated or how he made sense of the Holy Spirit coming on you and
 giving them all a language that everybody could understand was, he said, and I quote, "When the
 Holy Spirit fills you in your life as a Christian, your speech will be changed to purity so that
 other people will notice a difference and see the Holy Spirit in your life." And I'm like,
 that is one of the sketchiest interpretations of that verse I could imagine. That is what we call
 color body's worth. So, you know, people have a different view of what fire the fire is.
 Yeah. But the most common one that I've heard is what you just said that the fire is the
 fire of the Holy Spirit. My cessation is views, not that I hold to cessationism anymore, but
 you understand what I mean. Historically, I've heard that often talked in the context
 of judgment. So it could be that. So sorry, we don't have a more definitive answer for
 be a Hillary, but great question.
 Thanks for sending it in.
