<p> Island and AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Mr. Jones.<br/>
 Mrs. Jones, how the heck are you?<br/>
 So good.<br/>
 Episode 284.<br/>
 Keeping up with the Joneses, welcome.<br/>
 If you've just joined us, Emma Allen.<br/>
 I'm AJ.<br/>
 We are a husband and wife duo.<br/>
 We are.<br/>
 Living in Franklin, Tennessee.<br/>
 We are.<br/>
 And we all start our episodes with a weekly catch up.
 AJ, tell us about this week.<br/>
 First of all, we had lunch with our dear friends,
 RT and Louise, up in East Nashville.<br/>
 Kind of a surreal experience in that they picked a place.
 Now, if you don't know RT Kendall and his wife Louise,
 they're in their 80s?<br/>
 Yes, probably.<br/>
 Yeah, early 80s.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 No, he said he's 86.<br/>
 So later 80s.<br/>
 Yeah, I'm not sure what Louise is.<br/>
 I'm being a delicate.<br/>
 I got you.<br/>
 They are both American.<br/>
 They are.<br/>
 But they have lived in the UK longer than I have,
 when I was born there.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yes.
  </li><li>And RT is a very famous theologian
 and author something like 80 books.
  </li><li>Yes, and a riot.
  </li><li>And both of them, an absolute scream.
  </li><li>Yeah, they're so fun.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so we'd love any opportunity
 we get to hang out with them.
 And so they said, would you like to come up
 and have lunch and then we're like sure, we'd love to.
 And we said, why don't you pick the place?
 So I was a little taken aback
 when we arrived there
 because no exaggeration, it's a pool hall.
  </li><li>Yeah, with a bar underneath it.
  </li><li>It also happens to be Pride Month here,
 which I'm sure, I don't know if that's everywhere,
 in America, it's in the month of June.
  </li><li>But they're celebrating it full force.
  </li><li>Oh, we get to this pool hall/bar
 and there's rainbow flags everywhere.
 And our waitress is a lovely girl.
  </li><li>Yes, she's very sweet.
  </li><li>Interesting outfit.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Yes, so very skimpy outfit with a enormous skull
 and crossbones tattooed on her chest.
  </li><li>And you forgot the fishnet tights.
  </li><li>Yes, the fishnet tights and then yes, she was--
  </li><li>Big biker boots.
  </li><li>Yeah, but she's so sweet.
 I literally was like wow.
  </li><li>Seema-belivious 'cause they're surroundings.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>So we're just following their youth playing it cool.
 And you know, I cheekily said,
 what is it that you love about this place?
 And they busted the meatloaf is really, really good.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>But we're there for the meatloaf.
  </li><li>Yeah, we're any Nashville just kind of living up.
 Anyway, we had a wonderful time.
 But I have to say, best brisket that I've had since we moved to Nashville.
 That's a bold claim.
 Honestly, I was I was so impressed with the brisket.
 I did like the brisket, but also the french fries and I like the big beans.
 Guys, they had wait for it.
 Brown gravy.
 And that's why you like the brisket.
 Good brown, I didn't dip the brisket in the gravy.
 I dipped my fries, which by the way, you didn't order fries.
 I did.
 -Uh-huh. -And you kept eating my fries.
 -Wait, what's that? What's that on your left hand?
 -Oh, it's a ring that means whatever is yours is mine. -It doesn't really get to eat mine.
 -And whereas mine is yours. -I'll keep that in mind the next time I'm
 going to give you a chocolate, like tomorrow. -Good luck.
 That was Monday. Yeah, great time. That was really fun being with them. All the joy.
 -Yeah. -Our kids have been in camp this week.
 -They have. Tia did her first overnight camp.
 Yeah, she did.
 And yeah, so sweet thing.
 She's missing her friends so bad.
 So I was trying to do things to cheer her up because it's her last day of being 12.
 Yeah, tomorrow she's 13.
 I know, I can't believe it.
 And then MJ did day camp, same camp, dear run, great camp.
 And he came home each evening with tales of wonder and memory versus learned.
 Yes.
 Yeah, they both loved it.
 So good.
 So they've been away, it was kind of weird having one last child in the house.
 Yeah, like having Tia be totally gone for, well, five days.
 Yeah.
 I was, I missed her so bad, I couldn't wait till she got home.
 And then of course, you know, first dinner back, we're like killing ourselves laughing at the dinner table
 because she's just like, she's so funny.
 She's so funny.
 And then, you know, they're going away soon again too.
 So we're going to have to face it again.
 And then aside from a very busy week of meetings meeting meetings,
 we found time to do some celebrations, got to celebrate friends birthday on
 Wednesday. Yeah. And then today we got to perform a wedding.
 We did. Fastest wedding we've ever done.
 By far, and it was so sweet.
 It was a sweet wedding.
 I don't usually cry. I usually like smile, but not cry.
 Yeah, that was fun to celebrate that.
 It was so great.
 We got some great photos, too.
 Yeah. And then from celebration to discouragement.
 Discouragement.
 Oh, yeah.
 Apple store. Yeah. Sorry about that.
 I have a brand new 16 inch M1 Max.
 I love that you're looking at me like I would know.
 I forget what you want to do. It's a laptop.
 Yeah, I've got like, you know, the, the, the Mac daddy of the M1
 MacBook Pro, arguably the best Mac I have ever owned.
 The fastest Mac.
 It's astonishingly fast and I absolutely love it.
 There's just one problem in there.
 It keeps crashing.
 It also happens to be the flakiest Mac I have ever owned.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Like I probably get at least one kernel panic a day.
 A kernel panic is when the computer completely crashes
 and needs to be restarted.
 This is unheard of.
 Like that's common for Windows machines.
 Unheard of for Macs.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I have a suspicion what's causing it,
 but before I go down that drastic route,
 I thought I would make an appointment with a genius
 at the Apple Store.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So that they could run the battery of hardware tests.
  </li><li>Yes.
 Colonel panic. It's often, it's often a hardware fault. Yeah.
 But it's unlikely to be a hardware fault on this. It's brand new. It's straight off the production line.
 It's really unlikely. Well, they must have a genius bar for a reason.
 So took it in Ashley was very helpful. She hooked up. She patiently. Here's why I appreciate like
 normally my, I would say Apple's quite good at this. But normally my nightmare is when I call
 tech support and they insist on taking me through the 20 things I've already done before I would
 even call. Yes, but most people will not know to do the 20 things. No, and that's what's for
 strating. Because I would, I understand why they need to do that. Because if your mom called in,
 they would absolutely have to check that it's all. If I called in, never mind my mom.
 Oh, you would have checked me first and I would have done those 20 things. But I understand why,
 but what I loved about Ashley, she instantly said, thank you for telling me all that. You've
 you've eradicated the first 10 questions I was going to ask you.
 So you've already done this, this, this, this.
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.
 All right.
 So she hooked up to their battery of tests.
 She said, we'll run hardware tests that I can't run at home.
 And she said, I've released this nothing
 wrong with the hardware of the device.
 Right.
 But it's still crashing.
 It's still crashing.
 So she gave me some homework to do, which I knew she would.
 Which, for all other Mac users, you know, it's an arrays
 and install.
 And I don't want to do that because it's
 a four terabyte of data.
 And I don't want to back up.
 Anyway, one boring of the details, but I have a seeking suspicion and I have a plan to test
 asking a suspicion and I will report back.
 But I'll tell you what, even though I'm at a genius bar with a problem, I'm still in
 my happy place because they do such a great job of aesthetics and surroundings and it
 was a nice way to spend an hour.
 Good.
 Today, our main topic is a very special guest.
 Yes.
 Our dear friend, Shannon Macleard.
 Yes.
 One of our pastors at School of Supernatural Life.
 of my best friends. You probably saw on this episode before you played it, the little explicit
 marking. Yes. And I'm going to tell you why the explicit marking is there. But first of all,
 we want to give you an opportunity to pause this if you've got little ears. So if you're
 listening to this in the car, you're on a commute and you've got our podcast playing the background.
 Or if you're at home, you're preparing dinner or do dishes, whatever, and we're playing.
 And little ears can hear then go ahead and and pause. Go ahead and hit that pause because we want
 I want to give you a trigger warning, but the trigger warning itself could be triggering.
 So watch us just kind of pad for some time while you fumble to find your device.
 You could put in some like little bit of music.
 I could, but I think we've talked enough that somebody has probably found their problem.
 I hope so.
 Or had enough time.
 I hope you found it.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 So the reason we have an explicit tag and the reason we want to give you a trigger warning
 is Shana's going to be sharing her testimony which sadly features childhood sexual abuse
 another trauma.
 So if the discussion of that kind of content will be traumatizing to you, then you might
 want to skip this episode.
 Or we have used our chapter markers where I have highlighted the chapters that has some
 pretty harrowing content in it.
 You might want to skip that to some of the happier parts of the chapter because the truth
 with is a testimony and Shannon meets Jesus.
 And she talks about the healing that she received
 from being in relationship with Jesus
 and working through stuff.
  </li><li>And it's an amazing testimony.
  </li><li>Very powerful.
 But we just wanted to give you that heads up
 before you listen to it.
 So let's roll the interview.
  </li><li>Well, hello.
 I am really pleased to tell you I have one of my besties
 in the whole world.
 Here with us today, this is Shannon.
 Hi, she's never been on the podcast before.
 And actually I was thinking about that.
 I'm surprised.
  </li><li>I am too.
  </li><li>I thought for sure we already had you on a podcast.
 So I'm sorry here.
 It's, I'm sad that we've kept you hidden for so long.
  </li><li>Maybe it's all a plot.
  </li><li>It's all just, yeah, it's a big plot for you.
 (laughs)
 I thought it'd be fun to hear some of your testimony
 'cause I love what God has done in your life,
 but I thought it'd be really funny to start with the story
 of kind of how we met.
  </li><li>The stalking testimony.
  </li><li>The stalking testimony.
 And then we could talk about your actual testimony.
  </li><li>Okay. - Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>So when Alan and AJ first came to Grace Center,
 they came with John and Carol
 are not to do a week long school.
 And it was great.
 They taught on all these really great things.
 It was life changing.
 It was awesome.
 But as I was listening to AJ's testimony
 and was catching her personality,
 I was just thinking, I think we could be really good friends
 'cause I get her.
 And so at some point during the weekend,
 which I never go and talk to speakers.
 I just hardly ever would do that.
 But I thought maybe I should because you know,
 you never know.
 And so I went up to her and was just saying something
 about how amazing her testimony was and it just moved me.
 And if she ever moved here, we'd probably be besties
 At that moment, I think Alan was looking for security.
 They come and drag this crazy woman away.
 But it turns out I was 100% right.
  </li><li>You were right, you were right, look at you.
  </li><li>But at that point, you guys weren't even thinking
 of moving to Franklin yet.
  </li><li>We were praying about it actually.
 At that point, we had already, yeah,
 we'd already been praying about it.
 We'd come here to check it out.
 We'd both had dreams.
 Yeah, so we hadn't told anybody,
 like just basically John and Carol knew we were praying
 about coming and yeah.
 So it was quite funny that you were like,
 hey, if you ever moved here, I was like, okay.
  </li><li>I'm not taking that as a,
 I'm not taking that as a, okay, here's another one.
 I'm taking that as like, oh.
  </li><li>But it turned out great, didn't it?
  </li><li>Yes, it did.
  </li><li>So, yes it did.
  </li><li>So there you go.
 Well, I thought it would just be fun to sort of talk about,
 you know, whatever you wanna share
 about your life before meeting Jesus, after meeting Jesus.
 And I'll just kind of ask you some questions
 as we go along, is that okay?
  </li><li>Yeah, that's great.
  </li><li>Okay.
 I didn't meet Jesus until I was in my mid 20s,
 kind of early mid 20s.
 Up until that point, we had gone to church,
 kind of off and on.
 My mom's family were Christian scientists
 and they were pretty devout,
 although they went to doctors and stuff,
 but they were still, that was kind of their deal.
 I remember going to Christian Science Sunday School
 when I was little and being really interested
 and fascinated by all that.
 I mean, really the Bible, I didn't understand
 what the difference was.
 What the difference was.
 Yeah, yeah.
 But we didn't continue going there.
 Then we went to a congregational church,
 which was, you know, probably fine.
 And when I was, I think I was in about sixth grade,
 We moved to California for basically a summer.
 And I met these Baptist kids.
 Oh, you got to watch out for the Baptists.
 So you do.
 And they were going to go to their youth group was going to a Billy Graham crusade in Candlestick
 Park, which is a huge baseball field in, I think, Oakland, maybe.
 And so I saw Billy Graham and I was really moved by that.
 I probably would have walked, you know, gone down, but we were like in the nosebleed section
 of this giant baseball stadium and I was with a bunch of Baptist kids.
 They were all saved there.
 No one was going down front.
 Right.
 So, but I think at that moment, I think my heart came alive to Jesus, but it was another
 probably 14 years or something until, no, not 14, whatever, can't do the math.
 I was about 24.
 Yeah.
 Until I actually really met Jesus.
 My family life, I have two younger brothers and my mom was married to my dad.
 They were high school sweethearts.
 They got married right out of kind of right out of high school.
 Then my mom had me and then she had my brother.
 And then my dad asked my mom for a divorce.
 Wow.
 secretary, the day their divorce was final. Oh, I didn't know that. That's brutal.
 So my mom, of course, was completely confused, full of shame. We had to move in with my grandparents
 for a little bit of time. And then my mom started working. And so when I was around five, I think
 My mom had dated a couple guys, but nobody really seriously, this is funny though.
 There was one man who was, he seemed like he was a thousand years old.
 I mean, I'm only four.
 So he was probably my mom's inner twenties.
 He might have been in his 40s.
 Right.
 So, but a thousand years old.
 I mean, he did have a Cadillac convertible that I remember, but he was going to take us.
 I know I'm a car person.
 So my, I don't have any problem with that at all.
 We were going to go to the World's Fair was in Seattle this time.
 And he was going to take us to that.
 And everything was going well until he put his arm across the back of the seat.
 And it was a bench seat.
 And my little brother David bid his arm.
 So I think that was their last day.
 I mean, you know, he was just trying to protect his mom.
  </li><li>Yeah. - He didn't know this guy was.
  </li><li>You guys do what he was gonna do?
  </li><li>You guys are not gonna do it.
  </li><li>Anyway.
  </li><li>So my mom did get remarried when I think I was
 about five years old.
 Well, I was five.
 I was in kindergarten 'cause I had to switch schools.
 And the man that she married, she wasn't,
 she would say she wasn't in love with him,
 but he really cared about her
 And he cared about us.
 He wanted to adopt us, which he did really shortly after they got married.
 He adopted my brother and I, and had a good job and whatever, whatever.
 The only thing that she didn't really understand,
 nor did she understand for a long time, was he was a pedophile.
 And so he started grooming me for abuse because that's sort of what happens within six months
 of them being married probably.
 Wow.
 I didn't really understand what was happening and nothing really bad was happening yet.
 I felt sort of weird but it wasn't super bad.
 Also, I was...
 You're so...
 You're sobbing for a dad.
 You know?
 Right, right, right.
 He had some of the qualifications that I had on my list, sadly, or good.
 I don't know, but he was really, really harsh with my brother, who my brother's like a genius.
 And he told him regularly that he was an idiot.
 I mean, just so he was verbally really abusive to him.
 No, that's so sad.
 And he was always kind of trying to separate me and my brother.
 again because that's part of the program.
 Absolutely.
 And so I think the first time, probably the first time that he touched me sexually,
 I was probably about seven. I was young.
 Oh, babe.
 Yeah.
 And my mom was part of a choir that met on Monday nights.
 It's all during kind of the school year.
 And so that was sort of the, that was the night.
 By that time, he had moved my brother
 to the downstairs basement bedroom.
 And mine was upstairs.
 And every Monday night, I kind of knew something's gonna happen
 'cause my mom was gone from, at this set time,
 from this time to this time, every single Monday night.
  </li><li>Of course.
 The thing with all of that was that everything I wanted to do or anything I wanted to have
 was all attached to, "Well, will you be good?"
 Which meant, "Will you yourself and let me do what I want to do?"
 Yeah.
 So, every sexual first I ever had was with him, and this went on until I was 15.
 So that was not awesome, as you might have.
  </li><li>Wow, that's the understatement of the century.
 And there was not obviously,
 there were some things that probably no one would ever
 wanna do that I endured during all that.
 But I mean, we were so scared my mom was afraid of him,
 my brother was afraid of him,
 then they had my youngest brother.
 And I mean, just it felt like just trapped.
 And since he was always undermining my mom
 and critical of my mom,
 my mom at one point made a comment
 about she didn't think it was appropriate
 that he had me sit on his lap or whatever.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>At a certain age and he turned it around on her
 and you know, like how dare you don't be a pervert,
 blah, blah, blah.
 So it was a really terrible situation,
 really terrible situation.
 Things started to change and go a little bit crazy
 when I got into junior high,
 which was seventh, eighth and ninth grade.
 Between eighth grade and ninth grade, maybe I started
 hanging out with kids who were smoking pot and drinking
 and that seemed great to me.
  </li><li>Sure, your world is terrifying.
 Why wouldn't that seem great?
  </li><li>I had a kind of a serious boyfriend
 that made my stepdad crazy.
 I mean, just like crazy.
 And so that was a really weird dynamic.
 Again, anytime I wanted to go out with my friends
 or do anything, I'm always kind of paying for it
 over here on the side, which is gross and horrible.
 When I got to the end of my ninth grade year,
 I had a very serious boyfriend and I was sleeping with him.
 I mean, you know, why not sleep with somebody that you like?
  </li><li>Right, right.
  </li><li>I mean, it was bad.
 But at one, we were at a party.
 He and I were at a party one night
 and he said something like,
 I don't know what he exactly said to me,
 but what I heard him say was,
 if I knew your dad was hurting you, I would kill him.
 Now, we lived in a suburb, kind of like Franklin.
  </li><li>Right.
 And it was, you know, 40 years ago or something.
 It was a long time ago.
  </li><li>It was a good lesson.
  </li><li>There was no chance that that was actually gonna happen.
 You know what I mean?
 If somebody said that now.
  </li><li>Yeah, maybe.
  </li><li>There was no chance that that was gonna happen.
 But I was just like, oh, somebody loves me
 enough to fight for me.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so I marched into my guidance counselor's office,
 the school guidance counselor,
 who I had a relationship with.
 I was in a little group of girls
 and I was the kind of the good girl in the group.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>That the pot smoking good girl.
  </li><li>Wow.
 I was so much better than all those.
  </li><li>Oh, the rest of the girls were a group.
  </li><li>And I don't think that she,
 I didn't always hang out with those people at school.
 So I was sort of an undercover pot smoking.
  </li><li>I got you.
  </li><li>Whatever.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>And I went in and told her what was happening.
 I mean, just a tiny fraction of what was happening.
 And she immediately asked me if we could go to a family therapist.
 She came with me to a family therapist who then asked me,
 could we talk to your mom?
 And I said, yeah, that'd be fine.
 So my mom came in and again, I told a fraction of what was happening.
 Yeah.
 And she was like, okay, we're all done now.
 And so like we're all done now.
 We're all leaving.
 Yeah.
 We're done.
 'Cause she was thinking about the security of a house
 and she was really scared of him.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>Because he was a maniac.
 So she felt like if it was just her being--
  </li><li>Right, traumatized, whatever.
  </li><li>Yes.
 She couldn't see, she just couldn't see what was happening.
 So that started a summer of real scarieness.
 It was, there was about a month before he moved out,
 actually, she told him.
 I know, again, it was sort of,
 it's sort of like your horror story of walking
 into your house.
 Yeah, well, I came home one night with my boyfriend
 and he was there and my mom wasn't there
 And we maybe had been smoking something earlier
 because we went straight to the refrigerator.
 I don't know.
  </li><li>That's possible.
  </li><li>Anyway, he came in to the kitchen
 and slammed the refrigerator shut so hard
 that everything fell out of the door
 and said something really horrible to me.
 Something like, if you ever tell your mom anything
 I've ever said to you again,
 I'll kick your effing teeth down your effing throat.
 And as I looked at him, I didn't know what I was seeing,
 but he was completely, there were flames in his eyes,
 literally. - Wow.
  </li><li>He was completely something bad happening.
  </li><li>And inhabited. - Yes.
 And so, and my boyfriend's there,
 and I jumped behind him, like he's gonna do something.
 I run out of the house, and I'm a pretty slow runner.
 My boyfriend ran track.
 He was a really fast runner.
 And I didn't have that much of a head start,
 but I ran about a half a mile to this little lake
 that was by her house and didn't stop running
 until I was chest deep in the water.
 And he never could catch me.
  </li><li>Oh wow.
  </li><li>And so we went to my friend's house.
 There were no cell phones.
 I'm old.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>No, there wouldn't be cell phones.
  </li><li>And called my mom, she was at a friend's house.
 And she said, okay, stay at Julie's, don't come home.
 And you know, just needless to say, it was not good.
 She didn't leave me alone with him anymore,
 but it was bad.
 He tried to talk me into coming and moving, living with him.
 But I know.
 I know, psycho.
 Right. Psycho.
 So they get divorced, but it's messy and scary
 and there's threats.
 And when he moved out, we had left for the weekend,
 'cause my mom thought that that'd be easier.
  </li><li>Right, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>And when we came home, he had literally taken
 anything of value from the house.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
  </li><li>So that was horrible.
 He went into my room and took a whole bunch of my things.
 Just, you know.
  </li><li>To get back at you.
  </li><li>So that was bad.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>And we were afraid of him,
 But I didn't see him again.
 I probably didn't see him again for probably close to 10,
 12 years.
 And we lived in the same town,
 but I just never saw him.
 I didn't ever see him.
 I didn't have to see him.
  </li><li>And you have a brother that's his.
  </li><li>Yeah, so he would go and see him.
 But me and David, we never saw him.
 So there's all that.
 That's the backdrop for then the next 10 years or so.
 little bit less of my life.
 I did a lot of drugs.
 Actually, alcohol was my drug of choice.
 I drank when I drank, I drank.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>And was just trying to manage my life.
 It was, you know, I was a wreck.
  </li><li>Well, if you don't have Jesus,
 you're gonna turn to something.
  </li><li>Yeah, and my mom didn't really know what to do.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>So because I'd already gone through so much,
 She thought it would be better to just sort of let me manage myself, which wasn't.
 Okay.
 I mean, that's, I mean, probably she was just so overwhelmed because she had me, I'm 15, my brother's 13, and then our other brothers and nine.
 Wow.
 And we got all kinds of stuff happening.
 You know what I mean?
 There's just a lot going on and, and don't, you know, my mom has a job that's not making very much money.
 and Bill's not paying any child support,
 even though he's supposed to, but we're too scared, you know?
  </li><li>Right, right, right.
  </li><li>And I know that women all over the world
 go through this crap. - For sure, yeah.
  </li><li>Which is tragic. - Yeah.
  </li><li>But I spent the next almost 10 years just, you know.
  </li><li>Hiding an addiction.
  </li><li>Hiding an addiction in various forms.
 Then when I was 24, I had some friends who'd been trying to talk to me about Jesus for
 a few years.
 And I just wasn't interested.
 Especially the husband was really forceful, kind of one of those beat over the head with
 the Bible guys.
 And I just wasn't into it.
 would just go, you know, you're going to do what you're going to do. I'm going to do what
 I'm going to do. It's all good. Love that. You know, whatever people say that don't want
 to, that don't know anything. But then, uh, one day I went to their house, this couple,
 and they had this band, this Christian band that was rehearsing in their house. And one
 of the guys in the band, his name is Daven. And I knew him from, I'd known him for a couple
 years kind of off and on I'd see him places and whatnot.
 Yeah.
 And I cut his hair.
 Yeah.
 So he came out of the house with his Bible and I thought, oh, for the love.
 No, nothing with it.
 Yeah.
 And he starts telling me something and I'm a kind of a, I'm the person that just get
 to the point quickly because I might fall over dead.
 If you just give me all the details first.
 I'm happy to have the details later, but just get to the point right now.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Love it.
 So he's taking a really long time to get to this point.
 My friends has been had just been picked up for rape.
 Oh, my gosh.
 And as he tells me this, the only way I can describe it is I was shocked but not surprised.
 And something inside of me just went click, click, click, like, like when you do a combination
 lock, like it all fell into place and it was just like, oh my gosh, that makes sense.
 It's horrible, but it made sense to me.
 And I was so grateful that the Lord didn't let this guy lead me to him.
 That would have been devastating, you know, just like one more huge betrayal.
 So this friend of mine had two little kids under the age of four and no, she didn't have
 a family to support her. And so basically she's kind of in the same situation as my mom was.
 And so I'm just going to help her all the ways that I can. So I was spending a lot of time with
 her and she was just trying to figure out what am I going to do, dah, dah, dah. So one day we went
 for ice cream because you know, when everything's going bad, get ice cream. Now I still by
 lived by that role. I'm not going to lie. I went for ice cream yesterday for exactly that reason.
 Wasn't a good day. I got to go to Jenny's.
 Go for ice cream.
 So we're standing in the line and she just casually looks at me and just says,
 you know, you should get all the ice cream you can because where you're going, there won't be any
 ice cream. Well, had she not been talking to me about the Lord for several years,
 I would have been offended, but I wasn't.
 And so we went home to her house and I just said,
 okay, let's just say the prayer.
 And she and another guy from the house.
  </li><li>It was about, you're motivated by ice cream.
 I understand, I'm just kidding.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>I'm saying the prayer, as I'm saying,
 the prayer Daven walks in the house.
  </li><li>Perfect.
  </li><li>Turns out a few years later,
 Daven becomes my husband, which is awesome.
  </li><li>Spoiler alert.
  </li><li>But really what I realized in being with her,
 spending that much time with her in the worst time of her life.
 I knew her really well.
 And there's no way she could do what she was doing.
 If Jesus wasn't real.
 Yeah.
 There just was not a chance.
 I knew her.
 And she was not naturally super robust emotionally.
 Right.
 And she walked through this whole nightmare with so much
 piece that I just realized this Jesus stuff that she's telling me this hat, there has to be more
 to it than just what I read in this book. And so that was really what was behind motivating me to
 say the prayer. I got filled with the spirit really shortly after that. And so my relationship
 with Jesus grew really fast.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Because I was really about it, you know?
 Really about it.
  </li><li>Well, I also, I think like,
 I think when you've experienced real darkness
 and then you find light, you know, you're like, yes.
 But like, well, your personality is full on anyway.
 You're in there, you know?
 You're committed, you're committed.
 But I think that makes a lot of sense to me.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I'd been drinking a lot and mostly drinking.
 And one night I had moved in with my cousins
 and I was sharing my bedroom with a seven year old,
 or the seven year old was actually sharing her bedroom
 with me, which was kind.
  </li><li>Nice.
  </li><li>So I couldn't get into too much trouble.
 But I still had, I mean, I still had all the, you know,
 I mean, I still was going out to party sometimes,
 not as much as I had been, again,
 because my access was a little bit damaged.
 Yes, diminished.
 But I woke up one morning and I was just sort of talking
 to the Lord and he just said, you know,
 it's really hard for you to hear me when you're drunk.
 So I was like, okay.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I'll never get drunk again.
 Later, I had to renounce that.
 When the Holy Spirit thing started going on,
 it's like, oh, I'd like that right there,
 that Holy Spirit fall down thing,
 but not the rest of it.
 Holy Spirit, drunkenness, not yes, got you.
 But I just stopped.
 That's pretty miraculous.
 It was because every really close friend of mine
 either went to treatment or something bad happened to them.
 Because if you drink a lot,
 you hang around with people who drink more than you
 so you don't look bad.
 Right?
 So, right.
 And then everything kind of changed from then.
 Then my church friends, I was hanging out with them more
 and the people who party,
 they didn't really wanna hang out with me
 because then you gotta look at what might be happening.
  </li><li>Right, right.
  </li><li>So I just stopped.
 A couple of times I was tempted
 and the Lord shut me down in the best way.
 One time I was on my way out the front end of a vacation
 that was going to be full of people offering alcohol to us.
  </li><li>Right.
 (laughs)
 And I was just like, you know what, Lord?
 I'm feeling like I might do this.
 And I flipped my Bible open.
 I don't recommend this.
 It doesn't always work like this,
 but I just flipped my Bible open to,
 no temptation has overcome you,
 except that which is common to man.
 And he is faithful to provide a way out for you.
 I slammed my Bible shut.
 It was like, okay, no, I'm good.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm good.
 So that was amazing and crazy.
  </li><li>So tell us about Daven coming on the scene.
 I mean, he's already on the scene.
  </li><li>He's on the scene and so I got saved
 and then about, I don't know,
 less than a week later he showed up at my house
 and we were friends and asked me out.
 So I was like, sure, that sounds great.
 We'll go out.
 He took me to a really nice restaurant.
 He was dressed really nice.
 all great. And so we started going out and we went out for, I don't know, a month or six weeks,
 but I realized pretty quickly, he was way nicer than any guy I'd ever gone out with.
 And he was like too nice. Well, you weren't used to anybody being nice to you.
 No, I wasn't. So I had to dump him. Of course. Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, horrible.
  </li><li>It was actually good for me
 because then I spent the next 18 months
 probably really building my own relationship with the Lord.
 I know women who marry somebody
 who's further along spiritually than they are
 and sometimes that doesn't develop.
 They don't develop their own relationship.
 They kind of ride on the coattails
 of maybe their boyfriend or husband or whoever.
 And then when bad stuff happens, they don't have--
  </li><li>They don't have the foundation to it.
  </li><li>They don't have anything.
 Yeah, go through it.
  </li><li>Also, I needed a lot of healing
 and that probably wouldn't have been very fun for now.
 And can I just--
  </li><li>You know I would imagine that.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>I had a lot of issues.
 So we were apart for,
 huh, 18 months, probably.
  </li><li>Okay.
 And one day he got the courage to ask me out for coffee.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And as we're having coffee, he's being so cool, calm,
 and collected.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And he's like, well, I think we should pray
 about going out again.
 And I'm like, you are not asking me to go out.
 (laughs)
 This ask is so much bigger than, I mean,
 We already went out and I broke your heart and that was horrible for both of us.
 This is huge.
 This is a huge ask.
 Yeah, yeah.
 So I'm just like, ah, I got to think about that.
 And so I happened to be leaving for the weekend and was with this woman that I was sort of
 friends with, but she wasn't super in my life.
 We're in another city.
 And I just basically verbally processed, God bless her for listening.
 process kind of all this stuff with her. And she didn't have a dog in the fight. She didn't
 know Daven. She didn't care one way or the other. I mean, she didn't give me really any advice,
 but she was a great sounding board. And so by the time I got home, I was like, okay, Lord, you know
 what? This isn't who I'd pick. And the Lord being so cheeky. And if you don't know, he's cheeky.
 He's like, well, you've done a great job so far.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 Because really, I don't really dated jerks.
 Right.
 And so I'm like, okay, I surrender.
 I just surrender to you.
 If this is, if Daven, to you have, I surrender to you.
 So I tell Daven, okay, let's go out.
 And literally that list that girls all have,
 Yeah.
 He fulfilled every one of the things.
 My list was down to, it's going to be a guy.
 [laughs]
 -He's just breathing and have teeth, that sort of thing.
 -Yeah, yeah.
 -But it was so sweet, just all the things.
 He was not like anybody I had ever dated
 because I just always dated the wrong kind of person for me.
 -Right. -Right.
 -Yeah. He was really kind. He's very quiet.
 -Very steady. -Not really quiet.
 -You're not really quiet, no.
 Sometimes not that steady.
 Doesn't get, you know, all wound up about stuff as much as I do.
 Yeah.
 You're like the dolphin in the boat scenario, right?
 You have the boat that's like going along and then the dolphin going up.
 He's the boat.
 You're the dolphin.
 Yeah.
 Yes.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 That sounds about right.
 So that was in maybe the middle end of January and we got engaged on Valentine's
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>But we'd known each other,
 but then for like five years.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>We were a little older,
 I mean, we were older than all of our friends
 who had gotten married.
 So it's not like we were old when we got married,
 but we weren't like 22 or something.
  </li><li>Gotcha.
  </li><li>So got married, that was great.
 Then we had Mikayla about just a little over a year
 after we got married.
 Then we had Dallas a few years after that.
 But my big amount of healing started when Michaela was five.
  </li><li>Wow, okay.
  </li><li>Because when I saw what a five year old should look like,
 it all of a sudden occurred to me,
 oh my gosh.
 How could no one have seen, I was so mad.
 I was so mad.
 I'd never been mad at my mom
 'cause you know what, she was the hero.
 She moved us out.
 But during that season, I was so,
 angry with her. Yeah. Like how did you miss this? How did you miss this? Exactly. And you know,
 really, she missed it because she was in a lot of trauma too. Yeah. We were all really traumatized.
 But I'm so grateful. I have some really good friends in Seattle that knew how much distress I
 was in. Yeah. And they secretly, they secretly paid for half of all my counseling for probably 18
 months. Oh my gosh. Yeah. That's amazing. It was amazing. So, and I also had a couple
 other friends that on the weeks that I wasn't seeing my counselor, I would just go process
 with them. And they were so great because counselors are amazing. I love counselors,
 but they are your real life people. No. And if you don't have real life people who are
 are actually gonna keep asking you questions
 and calling you on things in a kind, loving way.
 You can go to all the counseling you want,
 but you need real life people.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, you need safe community,
 otherwise it's in a bubble, isn't it?
  </li><li>Yeah, so they would call me on,
 I was really, had a lot of victim tendencies
 and they would, I just remember getting in a big fight
 with my friend, basically,
 You don't know how bad I had it.
 Well, it's like, you're right.
 And still, this is not going to help you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I really love you.
 This is not going to help you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>We're going to have to help you learn
 how to live a different way.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Which was invaluable.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 It reminds me of, you know, again,
 probably a similar-ish age somewhere in my 20s,
 early 20s, mid 20s, when the Lord said something
 similar to me about, you need to choose
 whether you're going to continue to be
 defined by what you've survived or whether you're gonna let me tell you who you are,
 but you can't live in both worlds.
 Yeah.
 And I was so connected to my pain that I also expected pain everywhere.
 Sure.
 Because I was...
 Well, you don't have any vision no matter what people are telling you.
 You actually don't have a vision for who would I be without this, which sounds sort of sick
 and weird.
 In the midst of it, if this is all you've known,
 even if Jesus is offering you this other thing,
 you still need some help getting there.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, for sure.
  </li><li>You know what I mean?
 So it's like, I love so much that
 I love that the church is starting to recognize
 the value of therapy and counseling and all that.
 But if it's not, this is my opinion,
 if it's not coupled with a Holy Spirit guided inner healing.
  </li><li>I agree.
  </li><li>It's gonna be helpful, not the most helpful.
 Because you have to have the Holy Spirit
 give you what you need in order to do all the great things
 that they're telling you, okay, change your lifestyle.
 Yeah, that doesn't just happen.
 I mean, you could gut it out, I suppose.
 But real change only happens
 when you combine that information
 with the power of the Holy Spirit
 that enables you to actually do it and changes your heart.
 That's what changes your heart.
 You know that.
 I was so grateful for that kind of community
 and that kind of help.
 It changed my life.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I think probably we both are passionate
 about inner healing for the same reason
 'cause it could have gone really bad.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
  </li><li>You know, I mean really probably both of us
 wouldn't be here.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>You know, except that we found community
 that challenged us, that loved us back to life,
 that gave us tools that taught us who the Holy Spirit was,
 that walked through stuff with us.
 I think one of the things that I love
 about your story Shannon is that, you know,
 I feel like I know you pretty well.
 And you don't read at all like what you have survived.
 Like I think people meeting you would probably be like,
 you know, she's probably had like a pretty easy life, you know?
 Like, you know, probably not a lot has happened
 and she's just, you know, solid and full of joy.
 Well, and really you've, I mean, not to,
 don't want to be mean, but you've lived a horror story.
 And on the other side, God has taken all of that
 and he said, I can redeem everything and he has, you know.
 He's good like that.
 He is good like that.
 It's pretty cool.
 Yeah.
 So I, obviously I'm really passionate about inner healing.
 Well, and you're very good at inner healing as well.
 Not only, you're passionate about it, you're very good at teaching it, but you're also,
 Shannon's one of the people at church that will, especially for the school that meets
 with people and just helps them unhook from things.
 And I know just even sessions that we've done, you're just, you're skilled.
 Thank you.
 So you're not just passionate, you're skilled,
 but anyway, go ahead.
  </li><li>I think that that's what I love
 about being involved with the school, truthfully,
 is that I've met with people who are in their 40s
 and 50s and 60s, man, I'd like to catch you in your 20s.
 I'm so grateful that somebody caught me in my,
 I mean, I was in my 30s, but still, man, I'm so grateful
 that that happened.
 And I know that there's so many people,
 I'll just say this, when all this stuff came out
 when I was telling my mom, told my mom
 and no one was talking about incest,
 there was no court, anything.
 You couldn't, we could have maybe taken him to court.
 It didn't seem worth it to me because I was so afraid.
  </li><li>No, and then you have to keep seeing him.
  </li><li>Potentially, yes.
 And it really wasn't like it is today.
 I'm thankful that there's more predators
 being prosecuted. I understand though that this happens all
 the time. And I actually remember I met a girl when I was in my
 early 20s, who had a similar story, but her mom wouldn't leave.
 Oh, wow. You know, it was just like, so I know that that
 happens. I love to help people recognize. Okay, this was
 really bad. But it's not too bad for Jesus to.
 Yeah.
 Do something about you don't have to be identified with your pain for your whole life.
 Yeah.
 If you don't want to, yeah, it's painful.
 You're going to have to face it.
 Yeah.
 We can face it together.
 Yeah.
 But Jesus has something for you in the midst of this and you can walk away.
 It's not like you have amnesia, but it is like I don't have to live like that is true.
 Yeah, which is amazing.
 Yeah.
 So thankful.
 I think that, you know, again, I'm not particularly interested in what the enemy's saying, but I think the enemy does like to tell everybody like you're the one person actually who can't be redeemed like you're, you're a story is the one that's, you know, it's not possible.
 The worst.
 It's the worst or whatever.
 And I don't know how many times I've heard something similar when you're praying for somebody where they're just like, no, I knew God would, you know, I get it that God did it for you and he did it for Janet and he did it for this.
 for this, but I don't think he's going to do it for me.
 You know, and I think just to stop for a second and encourage you if you're listening or watching,
 like God has a redemption plan for your life. And he's so passionate about you experiencing healing,
 you experiencing walking into your destiny and really what you've been through. It doesn't have
 to define you. You can literally, you're not going to forget it. I'll just tell you that.
 You don't forget, but it doesn't have the power anymore.
 You know, like there's no power behind it
 to just sort of sap everything out.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So anyway, I just thought, if you're listening
 and this is like, oh, I didn't know.
  </li><li>Yeah, could we just pray real quick?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>All right, Lord, thank you so much
 for your power to redeem, for your power to cleanse
 and purify Lord.
 And I just ask right now, Lord, that if anybody,
 anyone who's listening that has a similar story, that they would feel your presence right now,
 Holy Spirit, that you would come alongside and bring your peace. And that's one of the ways that
 you know that His presence is there, the Holy Spirit's presence is there, that peace. And just
 bring peace to their mind.
 And Lord, I ask that you would open a door for healing.
 Yeah.
 If you're in the midst of a thing like this, I, I want to
 encourage you to go talk to someone that feels safe so that
 maybe a teacher, it might be a good friend.
 it could be a pastor or just somebody that you trust and tell them and let them help you
 begin to figure out a plan. Yeah. Yeah. So Father, I just thank you for courageous
 men and women who can look to you and trust you a little bit, just a little bit, and begin to walk
 out of the things that have defined them and defiled them. Thank you, Jesus.
 So good. I was just thinking, because we've still got the applications open for the school,
 And we didn't actually mention you are the pastor for the school.
 You and Matt are pastors for the school.
 And Matt was on the podcast last week.
 I heard that.
 Yeah.
 So I think it's quite fun that people get to meet you and hear your heart.
 But the thing that I keep thinking of is what we kept touching on is, you know,
 community actually, healthy community facilitates healing as well.
 And that's one of the things that we've prioritized at the school.
 And even in the online format, we have groups where we're meeting and we're having some sort
 of healthy community. But I was just trying to think, like, when you think about your steps to
 healing, if there's people that are listening that are like, I don't know how to do that where I am.
 I don't know how to find that where I am. What are your thoughts about that?
 Well, again, you could do the online school and we go through lots of, we give you lots of good
 tools, but also in our school, you have a small group leader, you have people in your small group
 that are committed to, you know, helping each other grow and etc. You can meet with me.
 there's a little bit of a start. If not, if you want to grow, there are so many resources online.
 Yeah. Lots of, lots of inner healing modalities and just finding one that feels good for you
 or safe for you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's things like restoring the foundations, heart, sync.
 the trauma prayer is out there. There's the Immanuel process, which is really great.
 There's lots of different modalities of, I mean, there's so many inner healing kind of different
 streams that are out there, but you want safe people. Yeah, yeah, safe people. If it's Jesus
 led, Holy Spirit inspired, that's really good. And something that has a little bit of a community
 aspect is really helpful. Yeah. We can put links to all those things in the show notes.
 So like restoring the foundations and all those things so that you can check some of those things
 out if you want to. Many of them might have a local ministry to you like they're all over the
 world, you know, quite a few of them. And so no matter where you are, you might be able to
 access that locally. Also, I just want to encourage you don't suffer in silence, you know, like
 If you're like, I need this, go after it. You're worth it.
 Yeah.
 So well, thank you, friends, so much for sharing your testimony.
 It was such a pleasure to be here.
 Thanks for having me.
 Yeah, obviously.
 Finally.
 Yeah.
 Finally.
 We're, if you heard any slurping while we were talking, it was that we're drinking coffee as well, because you might as well like, you know, make good use of your time.
 That's right.
 Well, thanks for coming.
 Thanks so much for having me.
 It was great.
 If you want to see a little bit more content from either Matt or Shannon, Matt was on last week,
 of course, Shannon, you've just heard. We've filmed a little video of them and we'll put a link in
 the show notes for you to be able to watch that. Yeah, it's just a fun little video where they're
 riffing off of each other and you learn a little bit about them, how they got involved in SSL,
 what they're doing in SSL. It's a fun little five minute video. So if you're looking for something
 a little palette cleanser from.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Oh, you just watched.
  </li><li>Yeah, you can be restored to joy with some laughter.
  </li><li>There you go.
  </li><li>And as you heard on the video,
 Shannon is one of the passes
 of our School of Supernatural Life at Gray Center.
 And enrollment for SO cell is closing quickly.
 July 15th is the date that if you're interested
 in doing SO cell online or SO cell on campus,
 you have to have your completed application in by July 15th.
 But maybe you're thinking, I would love a little bit more information
 by that, or maybe I'd like to meet with Matt or Shannon.
 To just even talk about is the school of good fit for me.
 They are available to meet with you either in person, if you're local
 or online, if you're not, to just talk about what the school is,
 see if it's a good fit for you in this stage of life.
 If you would like to take advantage of that and get some time with Matt and Shannon,
 go to schoolofsupernaturallife.org/connect.
