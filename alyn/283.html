 Most wonderful show is<br/>
 Keeping up with the Joneses<br/>
 Mrs. AJ Jones<br/>
 Mr. Jones<br/>
 Episode 283 of Keeping Up with the Joneses
 How are you?<br/>
 I'm good. How are you?<br/>
 I'm so good, but a little tired but very good
 It's true<br/>
 Give the people a weekly update<br/>
 Um, I spoke at church this Sunday<br/>
 On the Father Heart?<br/>
 You did?<br/>
 Yeah<br/>
 How was that?<br/>
 message. I've not heard you share that message in ages eight years. What six years? That can't be
 true. Mine have I ever been in for you? I suppose you're not usually there. Are you? Yeah. I cried.
 Did you? Yeah, I cry every time you share. So cute. Yeah. Second service went better than first.
 So that was good. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I just kind of ran out of time for service. I didn't
 pace myself very well. So it was my fault. That can happen. Yeah. So second service definitely
 better and and then we had Memorial Day. Oh, I love Memorial Day. Yep.
 We had some friends over. Hot dogs. Burgers, hot dogs, apple pie. Apple pie. Watermelon.
 I'm wearing my watermelon shirt. All the kids at church love my watermelon shirt.
 Yes, they do strangely. You have two watermelon shirts, actually.
 Love watermelons, what are you gonna say? What are you gonna do?
 Car news. Car news. We returned the Tesla. Yes. With a moment of deep sadness in my heart. Yes.
 Love that car. I know you do, darling.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And instead we got a...<br/>
 Porsche.<br/>
 (laughs)<br/>
 We do.<br/>
 Currently, we are driving a Porsche Boxster.
 Yes.<br/>
 A vintage or antique Porsche.<br/>
 I think I...<br/>
 25 years next year.<br/>
 Yeah, I think it's probably vintage.<br/>
 You look so good in that car, it's ridiculous.
 I love driving that car.<br/>
 Every time I see you, I'm like, "Woo!"
 Didn't you get on by one of the neighborhood cars?
 17 year old boy. I like drove by the way
 I was like what do you guys like what do men think is gonna happen when they do stuff like that like you're gonna stop and go
 Sorry what now?<br/>
 Did you want to have a conversation anyway? I laugh you look like very cute right now thing
 Yeah, it has both a funk and a trunk well, I was kind of impressed. Why are you sniffling?
 I don't know allergies. Maybe you're not getting sick. I don't feel like I'm getting sick. So must be allergies
 like I don't feel anything else just the stuff he knows.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah, I thought Tesla created the frunk,
 but no, the Porsche has a frunk and a trunk.
  </li><li>Frunk and a trunk.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I just like saying that.
  </li><li>Yeah, you do.
  </li><li>Frunk and a trunk.
  </li><li>Be careful how quickly you say that.
 What else happened this week?
 Oh, we had dinner.
  </li><li>We have friends.
  </li><li>Very special friend that we haven't had on the podcast
 because she has to remain anonymous.
  </li><li>Yes.
 And she's also on sabbatical.
 Yes.
 But she's one of a handful of people we know.
 This is a weird sentence.
 She is one of a handful of people we know who has died.
 I come back from the dead.
 The dead.
 Yes.
 And she exudes Jesus.
 And every time she's in town, our family loves to be with her.
 In fact, we went out for dinner.
 Our kids were fighting over who could sit next to her.
 Yes, they had to.
 We had to have like a rotation schedule.
 And then sweet MJ, our son who's nine.
 He really wanted to ask her about her resurrection.
 Yeah.
 So he great questions, but possibly my favorite question.
 Well, do this set up because she when she was raised from the dead,
 she actually saw Jesus and talked to Jesus.
 So MG wanted to know what a Jesus.
 What do you look like?
 So he's asking questions.
 But his most pressing question is, does Jesus have a handlebar mustache?
 And because our friend's first language is not English, she can look to us
 quizzically and I had to explain a handle, but she was like, no, he doesn't have a handle bar mustache.
 She did have a big beard though.
 No, he has a beard and she said it's shortish.
 Like it's a shortish beard.
 I thought his hair was shortish.
 It's shorter.
 She said shorter than in most pictures.
 Okay.
 So we need her to do an artist sketch.
 I know I'm going to.
 But the only thing we need to know about is no handle bar mustache.
 That's right.
 In case you're wondering, other than that, a very, very busy week, busy,
 Kids are on vacation. We just actually dropped T off at camp. Yes. She is away for kids camp.
 MJ leaves on kids camp tomorrow. Tomorrow. So it's a good week. It's going to be quiet.
 Then Jones household with just the eldest at home. Our main topic for this week is none other
 than the man the myth the legend Matt Krauss on. We've known Matt over 10 years. I think so.
 Matt and his sweet wife, Tiffany, our worship leaders are church.
 Matt is one of the S.
 for cell school pastors.
 And I invite him earlier this week to sit down and just tell some stories,
 wax lyrical about his life.
 I hope you enjoy the interview.
 Matthew James, cry of sworn.
 James Matthew actually.
 Are you kidding me?
 So see all these years and I go wrong.
 Matt, cry of sworn.
 Welcome to keeping up with the Joneses.
 Thank you very much.
 So glad to have you.
 So glad to be here.
 I'm honored.
 you are such a gift to our community. In many ways, I think you might be one of Grey Center's
 secret weapons. I say that because I think most people who would know your public persona
 will either know you from the school, you're one of the pastors at the School of Supernatural
 Life, or they will know you as one of our worship leaders. Actually, I got to meet you before you
 were either of those things. I think the thing that you carry comes out in both those roles,
 but you're like this hidden goldmine of wisdom about so many topics, but especially like human
 behavior, like for me, you're one of those people that like in the past I've come to you and I'm
 going to go do this with this. What's your wisdom on that? And so I think you're one of our secret
 weapons and I love that you're here. I love that we talk about you with you.
 Love talking about me.
 Yeah, that's a weird way to say it.
 That's what everyone loves. Talk about themselves.
 Tell everybody a little bit about you for people who don't know you.
 Like who are you? What do you do? Are you married? All that sort of stuff.
 Give us your like resume. Yeah.
 Your file. So I am married. I've been married to my wife Tiffany for almost six years.
 Are you serious? Yeah. Wow. That's why I was having to count it up the other day.
 It was like, I don't think I've forgotten. It just feels like so long.
 I made it sound great. I definitely didn't forget how many years I've been married.
 almost six years. I have two kids. I have my son, Judge, who's almost five. If you use the math,
 he was born 10 days before our first anniversary. So that was fast. It was great. And then I have
 a daughter, Rory, who is three. And I've lived here in Nashville and the area for almost 10 and a half
 years. Been here a long time now, which is strange. And I've been at Gray Center really that whole
 whole time. Gray Center is really my landing spot. When I got here, I had a tip from a friend
 about, you should check out M&amp;A. You check out Gray Center. You'd like it. And I did.
 So in a land with hundreds of churches on every street, I really have only been to Gray
 Center and like one or two other places to like minister on behalf of Gray Center. So
 it's really funny that I've only been to one here. But yeah, as far as what I do, like
 like you said, I work for school supernatural life.
 Me and Shannon MacLared are the school pastors.
 So that when I was,
 when I try to explain my job to people,
 I'm like, I don't, I'm not trying to make this sound
 like I work more than other people.
 I just have more jobs.
 So I run all the worship stuff.
 I supervise the tech things around the building.
 We're recording like up to three or four sessions
 simultaneously in the building.
 So I'm kind of like the on call person for that.
 I'm a pastor for the students, so that's meeting with people,
 getting to just mingle as much as possible at breaks,
 which is one of the best parts really.
 I loved just all the time I get to spend with people.
 It's nice to be, it's nice for that to be one of your duties.
 It's like be friendly and talk to people
 and get to know people.
  </li><li>And you're brilliant at it.
  </li><li>Because you have the most amazing people
 that come through. - You are brilliant at it.
  </li><li>Thank you. - Like you genuinely,
 like I know some pastors who have to work
 at loving people, like it's part of the job,
 it might not be the part of the job they love,
 like maybe they love the administrative part
 or maybe they love preaching on Sundays
 and being with the people of the heart.
 But you love it, it feels like, is that true?
  </li><li>Yeah, it is.
 I mean, I've become one of those people that previously
 I had judged, I've repented since,
 but I judged pastors or like manager,
 CEO type of people who are like,
 I just don't know anything.
 I rely on my administrator for everything
 and they set my calendar
 and I don't know where I'm supposed to be
 and they just tell me,
 But I'm like, oh, I've become that way.
 I'm like so happy to be with people
 and I'll live and die by whatever my administrator
 puts in the calendar.
 Shout out to Gina Evangelista and Rachel Herman
 if you're out there.
 Thank you for populating my calendar
 and making sure that I do my job.
 But I really do.
 I'm just, I'm very interested in people.
 That's, I would say that's been a core thing for my life.
 I've always been curious about how people think,
 how people make decisions.
 I have a degree in marketing that I never used until I got this job really.
 But for that reason, I was like, I wanted to go into psychology first.
 It was like to be a counselor or something like that, which is all funny.
 Cause so many things come full circle around.
 And you never know.
 Yep.
 But I figured it'd be easier to get a job if I had a business degree.
 So I'll get a marketing degree.
 It's like, it was really hard to get a job in 2010 in what I was looking to do.
 So, but I've always been curious about people.
 I just love asking people questions.
 I love strangers.
 I love meeting people.
 Like I love like gas station grocery store line people
 'cause they'll, I just love what people are willing to tell you.
 Or if you ask them a question about their day
 or what's going on, it's always great.
 So a little like in the school at a 15 minute break,
 I get a lot of done with people.
  </li><li>You do.
  </li><li>One of the things I know about you is like
 you're a really good thinker.
 Like I'm thinking back to when you were a student
 you would ask great questions.
 And now I watch you ask great questions of other people.
 And it feels genuine curiosity.
 It's not like I know the answer,
 and if I ask you this brilliant,
 it's a credit question.
 It's gonna lead you to some revelation.
 You're really like, no, I'm curious about this.
 And I think it works wonders.
  </li><li>Yeah, thank you.
 I really appreciate that.
  </li><li>True.
  </li><li>Just come on your podcast and get compliments.
 It's a great way to spend this Sunday afternoon.
  </li><li>Well, we're on high words of affirmation.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 You know, it's really fun for me to think about like, do you remember when we first met?
 I do.
 I wonder if we're thinking about the same event.
 Yeah, I think so.
 So my version of it was I had just moved to Nashville.
 My brother Mark was on staff with a church in Auburn, Alabama.
 The pastors of that church booked you and AJ to come speak at a regional campus ministry event in Panama City, Florida.
 Do you do? We remember the same event?
  </li><li>Same with him?
  </li><li>Yeah, of course.
 I mean, by the end of the story,
 I found it hard to forget,
 but so I drove someone else's car that I didn't know.
  </li><li>This one was the most matte croissant story ever.
  </li><li>Yeah, so.
  </li><li>Good.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>So I had lived in Nashville for a couple months.
 My brother calls me and says,
 "Hey, we're having a conference,
 but the person who normally plays electric guitar
 can't come, do you wanna come play?"
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>I don't do anything, I didn't have a job,
 I didn't have any friends, I didn't know.
 So I was like, "Yeah, what else would I do?"
 So I ended up driving somebody else's car
 who had left their car in Nashville for some reason.
 I drove that car to Auburn, Alabama.
 I rode with my brother to Panama City Beach.
 And then somebody somewhere connected and said,
 "There's people coming from Franklin, Nashville,
 "and maybe you could ride back with them."
 And that's what I did.
 So I just showed up to your van and said,
 "Hi, I'm Matt.
 "I'm hoping that someone has told you to expect me.
 "Can I put my amp and my guitar in the back of your van?"
 That's literally how I heard that.
  </li><li>Yeah, and then I rode back from there to Franklin
 with a van load of S.O.S.L. students
 from the inaugural first year of S.O.S.L.
  </li><li>They came with me and AJ as ministry team, I guess.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So I rode with them.
  </li><li>So I rode.
  </li><li>Daniel Helson,
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Frelian Garrett, Sonia Church,
 John Engleman, like so many people.
  </li><li>OG.
  </li><li>Yeah, met all those people
 and spent eight hours in the van with them.
  </li><li>I remember that conversation
 because of course, as a high shaper,
 nobody had spoken to me about a random dude.
 It's a electric guitar.
  </li><li>This is kind of safe for my students to like...
  </li><li>Did they find him on the street?
  </li><li>Literally.
 And you were, you know, now knowing you,
 of course it makes perfect sense.
 Like one of the things you won't know about Matt is,
 you could throw Matt in a hurricane and he'll be calm.
 Like you were just so calm and laid back.
 And one of the things we never,
 like at the school I think it'd be fair to say,
 a lot of stuff changes a lot of the time.
 You know, the plan will change,
 blessed or the flexible.
 You might be the most flexible person I know in terms of like,
 there will never be a problem with the plan changing for Matt,
 which has been wonderful.
 But not knowing that about you when this guy,
 this kind of affable, not just a long hair dude.
 Hey, you know, can I get a ride back like long hair,
 electric guitar guy?
 And we're like, who are you?
 Like what?
 And I think I went and had like a side conversation with Josh
 and Ginger like this.
 And they're like, no, he's good.
 What was your ride home like?
  </li><li>I mean, it was great.
 I was just getting to know all those folks.
 So like I said, I was like,
 I'd only been here a couple of months.
 I've been back and forth to home in Virginia.
 And so I didn't have any kind of established friend group
 and a bunch of those people really became my friends
 for that season.
 Like those are the people that I met.
 And on the topic of ministry schools in general,
 I grew up in church, short version,
 like I've been in church more than I've been
 anywhere else probably.
 And so I thought from what I had observed
 is that ministry schools that aren't like a seminary
 are for people who got saved as adults
 and they need to like catch up.
 This is like remedial church.
  </li><li>I see, like some are true, yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, I was like, man, I've been to church.
 I read the Bible, I've done all these things.
 I don't think I really need to go to like
 Sunday school again as an adult.
 Like that was my limited perception of what this is.
 But as I met all these people who were doing school
 supernatural life and I was getting to know them,
 spending time with them,
 I was like, well, your life is actually changing.
 Like over the couple of months that I had known them,
 I was like, well, I'm like watching you exhibit actual growth
 as a person, growth with the Lord.
 I'm watching you move in gifts of the spirit
 in a way that I've only seen quote unquote,
 special people.
 I had seen a few people that were,
 that I would call prophets or people that really flow
 in a gift, but to me, that was like,
 If all of the planets are aligned and the right person is here, but I'm like, man,
 I actually really know these people and I know that they're extremely regular people.
 Like these are normal people that are working at Wendy's doing, like they're
 doing whatever they're doing, but the Lord is moving through them and they're.
 So I was, that peaked my curiosity because I had, I figured I would never do
 anything like that. Um, that didn't have any use for it.
 But then as I was getting to see the fruit of it, getting to see what was happening,
 that really peaked my curiosity.
 And that was kind of what really led to me landing
 as like home in Nashville, home at Gray Center,
 because nothing else I was doing was working out.
 I couldn't get a job after I got here.
 And so my parents were helping me out, all these things.
 I would say moving to Nashville from where I grew up
 in Virginia, lived in the same time my whole life,
 went to college there.
 Moving to Nashville was one of the first things
 that I probably did in my life just because I wanted to.
 Like I didn't have a standard.
 I grew up as just a very, I mean, much how I am now.
 Eager to please, wanna make people happy
 and I was a good student.
 I was used to just having, here's the check marks
 of here's the next thing to do.
 Now you finished 10th grade, now it's time for 11th grade.
 Now you finished high school, now it's time to go to college.
 And then I finished college and there was no one there
 to tell me what to do next.
 And so I really got lost.
 Like I was very lost in terms of like,
 I don't know, I don't have anyone to people please,
 to like make sure that I'm doing well
 that I have a place in the world, I don't know what I'm doing.
 And so moving to Nashville was one of the first things I ever did because I just, did
 you know anyone in Nashville?
 I had a friend that I played music with in college back in Virginia who was a drummer.
 He moved here a little before I did and immediately said about like, dude, you got to come.
 It's the best.
 There's those people who can play music all the time.
 And so I came and visited and jammed with him in his band.
 And it was great.
 So I was like, all right, this is enough for me.
 Like I'm sure I can, I'm sure I can find a job here.
 I have a job in Virginia and then I just, nothing.
 Like I couldn't get a job doing the kinds of jobs
 I've been doing before, retail, sales, cell phone, sale,
 all those kinds of, I just couldn't get a job anywhere.
 So once I decided to do school super natural life,
 a bunch of things kind of just dropped into place for me.
 So I filled out the application and all of a sudden
 I had a job, like a friend's dad who worked for a company
 whose headquarters was in Nashville was like,
 hey, just call this guy, they'll give you a job.
 Give me a job.
 When I was thinking about how to pay for school,
 I applied and then my dad was like,
 "Hey, your grandparents bought you these savings bonds
 "when you were born, they've just come mature."
 And it was almost the price of school.
 So there were a bunch of things
 that just boom, boom, boom, fell into place.
 And I was like, "Oh, okay, I guess this is what it looks like
 "to, this is like my baby steps of trying to follow the Lord
 "instead of just following what can I do
 "to make sure I'm not doing something wrong
 "or make sure that I'm getting a good grade."
  </li><li>Wow.
 Because at that point, I was, I would say now in hindsight,
 I would say, I felt the Lord leading me to move to Nashville.
 Back in 2011, 12, I wouldn't use that language
 because I didn't really have a grid for,
 I'll have a conversation with the Lord.
 The Lord is speaking to me directly, uniquely.
 He wants to know me.
 Like I could have a real relationship.
 God was mostly like how I described.
 God is the person to people, please,
 to make sure that I'm doing well.
 which is a pretty good way to stay out of trouble,
 but it's not a great way to live a fulfilling life,
 which is what I was missing.
 So yeah, I didn't have that language,
 but I would say that was the beginning of like,
 I don't have any rules or instructions on what to do.
 So I think I'll just take a step and move.
 And then doing a school supernatural life
 was probably the second thing where I was like,
 you mean I can just decide to do something if I want to?
 I can try and maybe it won't go well and maybe it will,
 But that was really the beginning of a lot of that.
 So when I started at school, Supernatural Life,
 basically all I knew was that everything that I've been doing,
 everything that I know has not been working.
 Like I'm 22, I think I was about 22 or three when I got here.
 And I really don't know much of anything
 about anything useful because it's not bringing me life.
 I'm not happy.
 I was pretty numb to a lot of things.
 So that was the beginning of,
 I'm actually gonna do something risky, try something,
 and it's really beautiful.
  </li><li>What did your family think
 when you're going to a non-seminary ministry school?
  </li><li>They were happy about it.
 My mom always says that it was her idea
 for me to move to Nashville.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>So we go back and forth on how my mom was.
  </li><li>I love how my mom was.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's true.
  </li><li>But they were super encouraging to me.
 I mean, I would say my personality is to be very,
 can have a reflex, a second guess myself.
 I'm like over analyzing my motive.
 like, wow, like, do you have an evil motive
 for like wanting to-- - Is that still there, man?
  </li><li>Sometimes, but I recognize it now.
  </li><li>Okay. - Well, I'm just like,
 oh, I think I'm doing that thing where I'm like,
 why would I think that I have a wrong motive
 for doing something that's like Jesus?
 Like, that's like-- - Sure.
  </li><li>That's like the question that actually kind of like
 sliced through that. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>For sure.
  </li><li>But in the moment, yeah, they were very supportive
 of me moving.
 I think they were, my parents were pretty aware too
 that I just needed a change of scenery.
 I think if nothing else, that was a huge gift of moving here too.
 My family are wonderful.
 It wasn't necessarily to get away from them because of something they were doing,
 but to get away from the context of my life where I live in the same town.
 My siblings have been there, my family have been there forever.
 And so since being in Nashville, I would say that was the beginning of me kind of
 getting to know myself as an individual, as somebody that is following the Lord
 in a personal way rather than just how can I be like a non-interrupting, low friction part of the machine
 that shows up to church on time and does stuff. Really having my relationship with the Lord
 becoming in every day all the time thing. What did you get from school? Like you're talking about
 your life before. Like one of the key things you said, I don't know if you caught it,
 where you've described your life before as like living with a goal to please. But you also slipped in
 living a life so that you don't get into trouble.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I'm like, you know, like everything was gonna be
 tense stop because I remember, I remember,
 like that's probably the best you can hope for, right?
 Like one don't get in trouble, but man,
 if you could please somebody.
  </li><li>Huh?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>How about that?
 What shifted during the school?
 'Cause it feels like you're not driven or motivated
 by those two things anymore.
  </li><li>That's a great question.
 I think over the course of the school,
 I was really,
 What I learned about the Lord is that he's generous.
 Like he's always generous.
 Like even the concept of like mercy,
 being this like extreme offensive generosity
 that is it just eats up everything that is debt
 or everything that is lacking,
 everything that is falling short,
 everything that's broken,
 his mercy is like eating it up
 and covering all of it and paying
 for all these things extravagantly.
 And that was a new, it was just a new thought to me
 'cause like you said, I was very much how it was.
 I was like, here are the rules to live by
 and just be content and like don't seek out anything flashy.
 You'll store up treasure in heaven
 if you don't break the rules.
 But I came to find that the Lord being so generous
 that he was much more active than I thought he was
 and that led me to, I mean, it's always so like elementary.
 When you look back on it, you're like watching the Lord,
 how he walked you from tiny step to tiny step.
 But I would say to summarize it, my journey with the Lord in school and the succeeding years is really the Lord seeking to convince me, going to great lengths to convince me that who I am and what I'm worth has nothing to do with where I am or what I'm doing.
 Like of him just being like, "Hey, Bud, I really don't need anything from you. I'd love to just be with you. I'd love your attention."
 But like, I don't, I'm good.
 And so being with the Lord who's content,
 who's glad to be with me, who's generous with his time
 and isn't trying to bait me into like a codependent,
 like, well, I'm mad, but I'm not gonna tell you why.
 So you should pray.
 Like, so, and so most of these things,
 most of the conceptions that I had about the Lord
 were never anything that anyone taught me specifically.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>'Cause I grew up believing that God was good,
 God is kind, God loves us.
 It was, I wasn't coming from a place of like constantly trying to avoid going to hell.
 Right.
 I just wasn't a place of like, this is all there is.
 I've done it.
 And now it just coast until I die.
 It is so weird that thing, isn't it?
 The human heart's ability to pervert what is true, to make it feel familiar.
 Mm-hmm.
 And then the Lord's like, hello, I'm so much better than that.
 But also, I think, you know, what's interesting, Matt, is, you know, we reproduce.
 who we follow. And I just think like your description of the Lord is very much my experience of you.
 So like you describe in your description of your relationship with the Lord, where the Lord is full,
 right? It doesn't mean he doesn't, he's indifferent towards you. He's full. So he doesn't need you to
 work hard to fill him up, but he can enjoy being with you. That is very much my experience of you,
 where you arrive full to relationships and not like, I mean, you have this whole teaching on like,
 you know, debt-free relationships. Not funny that you've, like, you live out with that revelation.
 It's not just something you came across. That's very true of you.
 Yeah. I mean, I would agree because I would say the other piece of what I was learning about the
 Lord is the Lord would always talk to me about, you're made in my image. And it's not just to look
 like me, but it's actually to enjoy what I enjoy. It's to like enjoy the satisfaction
 in doing the things that I do. So that's how I'm just a person. There are so many things
 that I didn't, that I feel like I wasn't really taught, that I've just done them by trying to
 emulate the Lord, even in terms of like dating. Like nobody really taught me anything about
 my wife Tiffany is my only girlfriend.
 And I went about pursuing her by literally just trusting that.
 I was like, all right, I know that Jesus has been pursuing me.
 Like this is my experience of the Lord is he's pursuing me.
 He's reaching for my time in a way that's inviting.
 He wants to be intimate with me.
 He's like demonstrating interest in me.
 And so I just tried my best to treat her the way
 that I experienced Jesus treating me.
 And I have to say that it worked really great.
 (laughing)
 But I'm so thankful to the Lord.
 I'm just like, yeah, I don't,
 I'm not trying to speak badly about myself,
 but I'm just like, on the,
 the places where I felt shame in my life
 where I was like, I have nothing to offer,
 why would anyone wanna go out with me?
 At the same time, I've come to find
 a really beautiful humility in that.
 I'm just like, man, it's true.
 I don't have the answers for how to do these things.
 I'm not equipped to accomplish everything in life.
 I wonder if the Lord would help me.
  </li><li>But there is something so attractive
 about that humility though, Matt.
 You know, like I always think,
 I don't know who taught me this,
 but like I always think about humility
 as the lowest place.
 And if you think about a tarp, you know,
 when we go camping, whatever you make the lowest place,
 all the rain and the dew from the morning
 runs towards that place.
 And I think about that with provision from the Lord,
 that I know that when I humble myself, provision, whatever,
 it just runs towards me.
 And I see that like in your description of that,
 that makes total sense.
  </li><li>Yeah, and I mean, I learned a lot from you as well
 and from at school supernatural life
 or on Grace Center of the idea of,
 if you have to be somebody else
 or you have to change or fight or scrape to get somewhere,
 you're gonna have to keep the act up to stay there forever.
 And I was like, oh, Austin.
  </li><li>Wow, when you say it like that, pass.
 I don't wanna do that.
 Like, Lord, would you please teach me who I am?
 I have no idea who I am, what I have to offer.
 Like, I don't even know what I'm doing in my life.
 I want to be able to invite someone else into it.
 But that always stuck with me.
 I was just like, okay, even if I am not impressing people
 in this moment, I would rather be telling the truth.
  </li><li>That's not being a phantic version of not entertaining.
  </li><li>Exactly.
  </li><li>Than be inauthentic and exhausted
 from constantly entertaining.
  </li><li>Yes, because I think, because like we said,
 I had a lot of capacity for people.
 I love being with people, doing things with people.
 So as a younger person, I think I had a lot of capacity
 to be whoever. Like I was always playing a character.
 I would say that's a big part of my testimony to growing up is I was homeschooled,
 which I loved, which worked great for me,
 but I never found myself in a place where I like belonged with a group of people.
 So I would have like, here's like the like redneck kids that I play baseball
 with. Here's all the like kids that their parents are professors at Virginia Tech,
 who are from all over the world that I go to church with or do different things.
 Here's a homeschool group that I'm with. And so it was,
 I was very practiced at slipping into character,
 changed my accent to talk like these people
 when we're playing baseball.
 And then we were going to church,
 we were speaking as though the queen might walk in.
 And so I was used to doing that all the time.
  </li><li>And being rewarded for it.
  </li><li>Sure.
 Or at least like being liked,
 even just like, oh, I'm getting along well.
 But then as an adult,
 one, the payoff for those kinds of things
 tends to just sort of start to dry up,
 unless you're willing to really double down
 and like really become a different person,
 but eventually you're gonna run out of gas and I did.
 So I'm so thankful for all of that,
 that I've learned and being in a place like Grace Center
 where I found people's lives like believable.
 I'm just like, oh, I think I actually believe you.
 Like when you talk about the way that you are
 with your family, the way that you have boundaries,
 like I'm hearing that and there's so much authenticity
 in someone explaining that they're boundary,
 their reason for saying no is actually to be generous.
 Like I'm actually carefully budgeting my time
 so that I can do things well
 instead of spreading myself so thin
 that I have nothing to offer anyone.
 Because I'd witnessed a lot of that in churches growing up
 and that was one of the reasons
 why I never wanted to be a pastor.
 I was like, oh, I thought that was the job
 is to just spread yourself so thin.
  </li><li>Totally.
  </li><li>That.
  </li><li>Yeah, the only time you get time off
 is when someone's not making a request for your time.
  </li><li>Right.
 Other than that, it's like, "Go, go, go, baby."
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Yeah. - So, so many new experiences
 in living in Nashville, being at Grace Center,
 all the subsequent things that have done with the school.
  </li><li>Well, stay with us.
  </li><li>So you graduate the school.
 And then what do you do?
  </li><li>So I had gone on outreach as a student to England,
 to Sunderland, England, and just made some connections there.
 Like they were planning a house of prayer.
 There was a church that at the time we were,
 like Grace Center was very connected with.
 And when I got finished with school, I was like,
 "Well, everything I'm doing is kind of ending.
 "I was working seasonal jobs, school was ending,
 "all these things were kind of coming to a close."
 And again, on the theme of like,
 it seems like the Lord actually wants me to just
 actually tell him what I wanna do,
 instead of just only waiting to receive instructions,
 which is a new, again, new thought for me.
 And so I just reached out and said,
 "Hey, I know you're taking on interns
 just help start your house of prayer.
 Can I come?
 I don't know.
 And they said, sure.
 So I came, I moved to,
 I moved there from like fall 2013
 to the beginning of spring, 2014.
 And so I was in a prayer room all the time,
 like 30 hours a week, probably just leading worship,
 praying, serving in the church,
 cleaning, whatever.
 And that is a place that like I became
 really close friends with Jesus,
 because there were people around,
 but I was the only American dude for 100 miles.
 Sunderland is kind of, when I try to describe it,
 it's not a tourist place.
 I would call it like the Detroit of England.
 In the sense that some decades ago,
 it was one of the largest cities in the country,
 huge industry, all these things,
 and then a lot of the industry and things like that
 has been shut down.
 So when people would hear my voice,
 they would come and talk to me and say,
 why are you here? Like to hear that I'm American. Like, what are you doing here?
 Because there's not really much to like see. Right. And I was like, I'm here to,
 as an intercessory missionary, I wouldn't usually say that to people that are running
 to on the street. But I was like, I'm here to pray. I'm here to pray. I'm here to seek the Lord.
 I'm interceding on behalf of the city. I'm here to bless people. And it was stretching.
 Like I didn't really, I spent everything I had to get there and lived off just a little bit.
 I didn't eat a lot. I really, that's like a time that I think about.
 Funly, honestly, our life is so simple.
 We're like, I really, all I have to do is eat and stay alive and show up to the
 prayer room on time was like really beautiful.
 I don't know if that's for everyone for me, for Matt.
 That's like a pretty.
 You have done pot noodles.
 Supreme.
 I just got a picture of you just playing your guitar and weeping before the Lord
 and then eating pot noodles and maybe some Shreddies.
 Were you there?
 Did you see me?
 No, but more or less.
 Yeah. Absolutely.
 And so I became so close with Jesus because I needed that friendship.
 Like I, there were people that I made friends with there, but when you don't have a somewhere to be,
 like everybody else that is around is working in that process, not that you weren't beautiful before then,
 but that process really beautified you.
 Absolutely.
 And it could have made you bitter.
 Yeah, I lost like 30 pounds while I was there.
 I remember when you came back, I remember bumping into you.
  </li><li>You were sitting on the front porch with your journal,
 sitting at the balcony part looking in.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>And I forget who I was with.
 Maybe I was with Jeff, and I walked past you,
 and I came back, and I was shocked that you were back.
  </li><li>I so vaguely remember that.
  </li><li>And I remember walking away from that interaction
 and he was like, "Bro, you're back?"
 And I think I was with Jeff, 'cause I remember sitting at Jeff.
 Because I remember Jeff and I had you on our, like,
 you know, I've talked about this before,
 but Jeff has this habit of collecting people,
 where, you know, he collects people,
 people, he knows they fit somewhere, but they don't. And both of us had this real thing in our
 spirit where we're like, Matt belongs at Gray Center, and we don't know where to put him, but we can't
 lose the opportunity of having him. So I think we just created something for you, didn't we?
 I don't know. I mean, I'm in like it shortly after that, they were like, yes. Yeah. So at that point,
 probably when I saw you, I was planning on going back. So I had gotten a visa to go back for another
 year as a charity worker, like the church had a nonprofit and much
 thing. So I was going to go back because that's what I felt like
 was the right thing to do when I would talk to the Lord about it.
 Because they asked me to come back and I said, let me pray, but like, yeah,
 I think so. Like, and the Lord challenged me.
 I was surprised because he was like, have you considered what else you could be
 doing? And I was like, no, because this is the best.
 Like I feel so alive.
 I feel like I'm doing something that I was made to do.
 Yep. Like I'm playing to all my strengths.
 I'm getting to live this like sort of modern, like monk-like existence, which really works
 for me.
 But the Lord was like, if you won't consider what else you could be doing, then you're
 not really giving me your whole.
 Yes.
 Like if you're putting on blinders to be, this is the only thing I can do.
 You're still doing that old religious thing where you're just trying to people, please.
 Right.
 And it's not sacrifice.
 So I still landed on it.
 I think this is the right place for me to be.
 But when I got back to the states, I had a couple of dreams about my visa being denied,
 these different things. And so I was like praying against that. No, like I feel like I'm supposed to go.
 And so long story short, my visa went through everything I could have gone. But as soon as I landed in Nashville,
 everything just felt different. So I was at home in Virginia for a couple weeks, and then I got off
 the plane here. And I was like, man, it feels like everything that I had planned is all like
 zero gravity floating. Josh Parsons, like really offhandedly asked if I wanted to come on as a small
 a small group leader for the school that fall.
 Like within like one minute of seeing him at M&amp;A,
 some of the things that happened too
 at Grace Center while I was gone
 of like different staff leaving and different things like that.
 So I was kind of like, wow, everything looks different.
 And one of many like kind of cryptic things
 that Jeff said to me in that season is he was just like,
 "Hey, hey, if everything like looks different to you,
 "it's because you've been promoted in the spirit,
 "but your circumstances haven't matched up to it yet."
 And I was like, okay.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I'm running out of time.
  </li><li>Which honestly was helpful to me because I was like,
 yeah, it does.
 I'm having a different experience of this place
 that was super familiar to me.
 And then having conversations with you guys
 of even the same of Jeff saying that to me too.
 It was like, I think that you fit here.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And he said, he said, I have something really unfair
 to tell you.
 I'm just gonna tell you this, it's super unfair.
 And I was like, okay, like I'm not gonna stop you.
 Like you're like right hand man to Jesus,
 in my opinion at the time.
 I still think that, but at the time, I was just like, oh, okay.
 And he was like, I think you fit here.
 You have a place here, but, uh, I don't have a, like, I have to think off for you.
 So it's like, okay, I'll just keep doing what I'm doing.
 And so I was a small group leader that year, but just part-time, like volunteer
 staff for the school.
 Um, but when it came down to it of deciding whether to go back to England or
 stay here, I finally got to a point where the Lord was like, Hey, like, you can
 just choose, you can just choose what you want to do.
 you've done your due diligence of like praying,
 seeking all those things,
 and actually you need to just decide what you wanna do.
 And the thing that I came to was,
 as much as I loved what I was doing there
 at the House of Prayer,
 I was very aware that if it hadn't been for what I had
 received in school supernatural life,
 and particularly from my small group leader,
 I wouldn't have been able to engage with any of that.
 Like all of that was complete unknown territory to me.
 And I was like, you know, Lord,
 If I could do that for one or a few other people,
 that would feel extremely worthwhile.
 'Cause I was like,
 "I could do for others what was done for me
 that is a rewarding way of living."
 Oh, yes. Yeah. Absolutely.
 And so that's really, I think,
 what kind of started the ball rolling with where I am now,
 I'm just like, "Oh, actually,
 the satisfaction of getting to do for someone else
 what was done for me."
 John Reed, my small group leader,
 just always looking me in the eye saying,
 It's so easy to love you.
 I'm so glad to be with you.
 I'm so glad that you're here.
 And I was like, you don't even know me.
 You don't know anything about me.
 How could you possibly think it's easy to love me?
 Also, you're so handsome and there's just a lot going on, but he was so consistent
 and kind and tender to me.
 And that absolutely changed my life.
 So I was like, that's worth it.
 Like that would be worth it to let go of what I've been doing to do that, even
 if it was just one round.
 Yeah.
 Like if it was just for a year to do this, I was aware of how much one year changed my life.
 Right.
 So I was like, yeah, that's a great investment.
  </li><li>And how many years has it been?
  </li><li>Yeah, and that was 20.
 So I was a small group leader the first time.
 That was fall 2014, it's 2022 now.
  </li><li>Yeah, you look at me like I know the answer to either of those.
  </li><li>I don't know.
 I've been at every year of school except two.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>So that's 10 out of 12?
  </li><li>That's wild.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>And then you shifted from being a small group leader to--
  </li><li>So I came on staff as a pastoral assistant,
 working with Shannon the following year.
 So I was still leading a small group, but I was also working on stuff.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 And then became the school pastor 2017, right after my summer
 was born. And then here we are.
 What do you notice? The shift happens from, because in one sense, I
 know this is not true, but from an outside perspective, small group
 leading and pastoring kind of looks the same, just more of it.
 Like, you know, small group leading is like, you're a part-time volunteer
 pastor. I know that's not true. And pastor, you have a whole host of other responsibilities.
 What do you notice is the difference between the two?
 That's a great question. For me, it not much. Like I didn't feel very different because I was,
 I'll unpack that a little bit more. But for me, my philosophy with all those things is,
 I'm here at church, I'm here at school. This is my house. I own this place. This is where I live.
 I know where all the bathrooms are.
 I know where everything is.
 So if somebody needs something,
 I have what they need because I live here.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But it was like when I was a kid growing up,
 if people came to our house for dinner,
 it's my house.
 Like yes, technically it's my parents' house,
 but I live here.
 I know where everything is.
 And it would be wrong for me not to like host you also.
 So that's just how it treated it.
 I would say the difference between being a volunteer
 to being on staff is just that I have more resource
 to be generous with in that way.
 I actually have more that I can give people.
  </li><li>If I'm having a check.
  </li><li>Yeah, exactly.
 I'm like, no, I actually, I can tell you
 like what we're doing next or I can offer you
 some resources on someone to call or I can.
 Like there's just so much more that I can be generous with
 as a pastor on staff that I can as volunteer.
  </li><li>I think one of the things I've noticed about you Matt,
 is when we've faced some pretty big pastoral issues, right?
 Again, it comes back to your unfazedness
 and your unfazedness isn't indifference,
 that isn't a lack of understanding
 of how serious the situation is,
 it seems to me, at least my impression is,
 it's the confidence that God is gonna give us
 what we need to meet the person's need.
 Would that be accurate?
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, my need.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And not to oversimplify it,
 'cause there's so much that goes into sorting
 through issues like that.
 But I think, again, I come back to that same realization
 that I had when I first moved here is,
 whatever I've been doing, trying, whatever I understand,
 that I've like earned, the understanding that I've like earned
 is not gonna be enough.
 So I already know that I need the Lord to speak.
 I need the Lord to speak into the situation.
 I need the Holy Spirit to move.
 I'm already looking for that before I've exhausted
 all of my questions and resources,
 'cause I'm sure that we'll get there.
 I was a nice person, but I was a mess too.
 Like I had a lot of things going on.
 I remember I used to go back and read my own SLSL application
 every year before I would read student applications
 because it gave me so much grace for people
 because I would read my application and be like,
 "Well, I have struggled with pornography in the past,
 "but I've had some recent breakthrough
 "and things are going a lot better now."
 And I was like, "Oh, buddy, they were not going better.
 "This is the narrator."
 And deeply-- - How?
  </li><li>12 hours. - Yeah, 10 minutes ago.
 Now I'm having a lot of breakthrough
 and a bunch of other things.
 So I had, I was in so much like denial
 about all those things when I came
 And the thing that the word really opened up for me through Grace Center is not being
 in denial about anything, just being honest about what's going on.
 And it's better to invite the Lord and people you trust into something messy as fast as
 possible.
 Yeah.
 And so I think I'm always, I'm probably in some ways, I always feel privileged to like
 be in with someone that's having a hard time to be trusted, to listen and be there to do
 something.
 You are a relentless source of optimism though, in crisis.
 You really are.
 And I think it's you're so tethered to the Father and to the Kingdom of Heaven that it
 just seems obvious that God's going to do something.
 You know, I had a boss that, I mean, he was facetious butWhat 
 was his name?
 David.
 David.
 And he used to say, I'd come to him, I'd be like, "Hey, David, we've got a problem."
 He's like, "Annie, there's no such things as problems, only windows of opportunity."
 Oh my God.
 annoying, but I feel like you live with that outlook, you know,
 especially when we're helping people like, ah, and I remember, you know,
 I used to help lead the school.
 I haven't done that in a number of years, but I would always enjoy being in school
 meetings where we'd be planning things or talking about a problem.
 You would always have a perspective or an outlook that just felt like you just
 picked up the thing and just turned it and there's a different facet.
 Didn't nullify what anybody was talking about, but you always had this perspective
 in this option that I think is the gift of wisdom.
 You know, yeah, I mean, I
 I would say in speaking about optimism, my earlier life was like
 probably the most unhealthy version of that is denial.
 Just be optimistic and hold on to that until you quit getting dragged down the road
 by a truck. Like, but now I feel very authentically connected to that.
 Like you said, because I'm just like, Oh, I love getting to live.
 in the confidence, not my own confidence,
 but in the confidence of Jesus.
 If you think about how confident the Lord is
 to do everything that he says he's gonna do,
 he makes these grand, wild proclamations
 of things that he's gonna deliver people from
 and how he's gonna do all this stuff.
 And then he just does it.
  </li><li>And he's confident he will do it.
  </li><li>He's so confident.
 He's so patient in ways that I have a hard time
 being patient 'cause I was like,
 well Lord, it's great that you can be confident
 in eternity, but I need to pay my rent tomorrow.
 Like, how am I supposed to be confident?
 Like, how can I be, have the Lord's confidence for that?
 Or time is ticking.
 Yeah, and the Lord is so patient because he's so confident.
 So yeah, I like being able to be that like optimistic,
 looking for a perspective.
 I also, it's been interesting for me,
 like over the course of the school,
 I've written some different teachings,
 most of the ones that I've gotten to do,
 which are feel, there's lots that are built into the school
 that are like, this is what the school is built on.
 Sometimes we'll have space to write something original,
 something else and the things that I've gotten to write on
 have been a lot of things like that about wisdom,
 cultivating wisdom, writing on building relationships
 that aren't built on what we owe each other,
 but how can we be generous to each other?
 And that was always my favorite Bible story.
 I remember being a kid and reading the story of Solomon
 where the Lord comes to him in a dream and says,
 "Anything you want, well, I'll give it to you."
 And he says, "Oh, I want to be wise.
 "I want to be perfectly wise."
 And then the Lord says, wow, you picked the best one.
 You picked the most ideal thing.
 And because of that, I'm going to give you everything else.
 So you'll never lack anything.
 You'll have anything you could dream of.
 It'll be yours.
 And I remembered reading that story.
 And again, being my little self that's always second guessing,
 I'm like, oh, does that mean that?
 I was like, I want to ask the Lord for wisdom too,
 because that sounds great.
 But will the Lord think that I'm asking for wisdom
 just to get all the other things?
 Isn't that so cute?
 Like thinking about a little kid,
 having that internal conversation.
 But that's been really the thing that I've wanted.
 I remember just being so inspired by the stories
 of things that Solomon did and said with people,
 I was like, man, I just want to be like that.
 And so I'm in the season that I'm in currently,
 it's very strange because the Lord has really stripped away
 a lot of the things that I previously would have hid behind
 as far as being like, oh, no, it's all the Lord.
 I'm just a little old me.
 And really it is interesting finding the ways
 where it's actually important to be confident
 and leading people to build confidence in them.
 I was like, I'm not trying to like flex on people
 or brag about what's going on,
 but actually if I don't tell the truth
 about what the Lord is doing,
 then I'm holding something back from you.
 So this has been a very like interesting
 four or five years for me in that way.
 But yeah, I'm always just,
 for me that comes from the same place
 as prophesying to someone.
 Like looking for the answer to a solution, I would say, well, it talks about first Corinthians, all the gifts, word of wisdom is right there with word of knowledge and prophecy and all those things.
 And it's just like a practically applied revelation.
 I'm just wondering, you know, I'm picturing one of our listeners, several of our listeners listening and maybe where your life was is where their life is and what you're talking about your life.
 if it's glistening with hope,
 maybe it's how we reach for them or feels that way.
 Do you have three practical encouragements
 you could give somebody who's living where you were?
 What would you say, go back in time
 to your little 22 year old self?
 Like what would have helped you to hear?
  </li><li>That's a great question.
  </li><li>So I would say first,
 is that I would say the thing that the word has spent
 so much time like hammering into me.
 I say hammering, but like gently massaging,
 sometimes hammering, sometimes like immersing,
 sometimes going to great expense and length,
 taking me all over the world to all these different
 situations and people is to convince me of the truth
 that who you are and what you are worth has nothing to do
 with where you are and what you're doing
 or what you're able to do.
 Like you actually have value because God has placed it in you.
  </li><li>Beautiful.
  </li><li>I'm telling you the truth.
 If you're in that place and you think that you have nothing
 offer and I have no way to move forward.
 I'm just telling you that the Lord has placed value in you on purpose.
 Just like you have a name that was given to you, you have value that was given to you.
 You are a gift.
 The Lord always tell me that was a gift and I said, no, I'm not.
 I'm the worst.
 I would get so angry at the Lord for like being kind to me.
 Cause I'm like, Lord, what I need to be is punished so that I can learn from my
 mistakes and grow.
 And he was just like, or we're all out of that.
 Like I don't have that.
 Yeah.
 That's not what I'm interested in.
 Yeah.
 So that's one who you are and what you're worth has nothing to do with where you are
 or what you can do or what you're doing right now.
 Second, I would say
 that admitting that you need something that you don't have is probably the first
 step to growing. So even, I mean, that's a different way of saying James one five, like the Lord gives wisdom freely to any who ask without
 approach, which means no shame or any of those things. So coming to a place like, I have come to this place many times, become very familiar with the place of
 realizing that what I know and what I've been trying clearly isn't working. So let me, whether that's finding a mentor or someone like someone to coach me or leave me just
 submitting to someone else's leadership is a huge part of it.
 But also with the Lord, just saying, Lord, I don't have what I need.
 Can you help me?
 And I would come to a place of even addressing the Lord differently.
 I was always one of those people that would kind of like sideways laugh at
 people that would call God, like daddy and all these super familiar things.
 I was like, this is the Lord we're talking about.
 Okay.
 Uh, but I came to a place where I realized that what I needed was advice from a
 dead.
 Yeah.
 And so when I started to address the Lord, that way it's dead.
 I need advice from you.
 I need help from you with this thing.
 I need help with how to talk about this subject with,
 like, can you just help me?
 'Cause I don't know.
 And he's so kindly would help me.
 He would bring me solutions, bring me ideas,
 and just be with me.
 And I would say the other thing is that
 if you're feeling stuck or feeling like
 you don't have a way forward,
 the thing that's coming to mind right now,
 this is interesting.
 'Cause you could ask me this question on any given day
 I would probably have different thoughts.
 But my thought at the moment is
 that the Lord wants to speak to you directly.
 Like I really want to tell whoever's listening to this,
 the Lord really wants to speak to you
 and he's really able to speak to you.
 And you don't have to be more special or unique or rare
 than you think you are now for the Lord to speak to you.
 I think something, again, the Lord is so generous
 that he will speak to us through whatever size pipeline
 I'm willing to let him, so generous.
 He doesn't have to do that, but he does.
 And so I would like short of looking for a course,
 like Mark Verkler, hearing God's voice,
 the four keys to hearing God's voice,
 something like that.
 Outside of doing that, I would just try even now.
 Sit quietly and say, Lord, I believe
 that you want to speak to me.
 Would you speak to me?
 Would you speak to me in a way that I can understand you
 and then just pay attention to what's going on around you?
 And especially look for somebody that then comes to you
 with advice, a person.
 The Lord loves to speak through people.
 So yeah, I think those are a few things.
 I feel kind of like scattered.
 I wish I had a more succinct thing.
  </li><li>Things are gold right there.
  </li><li>I would say number one is the biggest one to me.
 Like who you are and what you're worth
 has nothing to do with where you are right now,
 has nothing to do with your history,
 has nothing to do with the track record
 that you keep in your head.
 The Lord has a very different opinion of you
 than you do of you is my constant experience.
  </li><li>So beautiful.
 Matt Croissorne, I'm wondering, people are listening to this
 and they're like, I need more Matt Croissorne in my life.
 Where can people find more from you?
 What's your socials?
  </li><li>That's so active.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, I mostly post like silly things
 on Instagram, for me and honest.
 I don't have like a big platform, but @MattCrausorne
 is my Instagram, Twitter, at Grace Center.
 (laughs)
 Come to Grace Center in Franklin, Tennessee,
 or on their YouTube.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And you'll see me pop up there from time to time.
 My wife and I lead worship.
 I'm just,
  </li><li>You're phenomenal.
  </li><li>Just try to do whatever anybody asks me to do.
  </li><li>Hopefully.
  </li><li>I mean, really the place you could really find me
 is at school, super natural life.
 Whether in person or online,
 that's, there's some more kind of like,
 you have to pay tuition to come to that.
 But yeah, I mean,
 I don't have a big place
 where I'm putting out tons of content or things like that.
  </li><li>You are a wordle fiend though.
  </li><li>You know, I was.
 I've, it just trailed off.
 I think after I missed a few and I was so far from 100%,
 I just lost the satisfaction.
  </li><li>My problem is it moved to the domain
 from where it was to like now New York Times.
  </li><li>I reset your stuff.
  </li><li>I'm gonna try to play it.
 It's like, oh, we've moved to New York Times.
 And when I go to New York Times,
 it doesn't have any of my cookie stored.
 So all of my track record has just lost them.
  </li><li>Yeah, I was into that for a while in Quirtle.
  </li><li>The four simultaneous Wertels.
  </li><li>I don't know how you did that.
  </li><li>I loved it.
 That was good.
  </li><li>It was like a brain massage.
  </li><li>Well, Matt Croix, one, thank you so much
 for giving me your time being with us.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>What a joy to be able to share you
 with our listeners, thanks for being here.
  </li><li>Yes, thank you so much for having me.
 I feel really honored.
 I'm just grateful to be here.
 I wanna say thank you for hosting me.
 Thanks for all the things I've learned from you.
 I've learned so much from you over the years
 as a teacher, as a pastor, as all those things.
 And so I feel really honored to get to be here with you.
  </li><li>I love that we get to do this, man.
 Thanks for coming.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>I would say.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>One of the things I've loved most
 in the last 10 years is helping launch the school.
  </li><li>Yeah, one of the things we've gotten to do.
  </li><li>Yeah, absolutely.
  </li><li>Love it.
 And so Matt and Shannon, one of our SSL pastors,
 in fact, Shannon's gonna be on the podcast next week.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>They're the pastors at the school.
 And it's funny, you know, for years, people have asked us
 if we would put SSL online.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>For people who couldn't come here
 and we didn't think it was possible.
  </li><li>But then we did it.
  </li><li>Only takes a global pandemic.
  </li><li>That's all it took.
 Just a global pandemic.
  </li><li>A lot is possible.
 So that means we actually now have two options
 do the school. You can come here to beautiful Franklin, Tennessee, which I love. You can come
 do SSL on campus, which is here. It lasts eight months long. We're applications for that closed
 July 15th. We start the school September 6th, September 6th, 2022. So if you want to come
 live here for eight months, come and do the school. But you can also do the exact same school online.
 And same thing, applications close July 15th, kick off sometime in September, maybe the week after.
  </li><li>Same week. - Oh, same week.
  </li><li>Yeah. - And it's an amazing incubator for your heart, really.
 It's an amazing opportunity to come learn from Grace and her staff,
 learn from the relationships that we have with visiting prophets and apostles and teachers and
 pastors. And I've just seen so much transformation in the lives of the students that have done the
 the school in the last 10 years. And I would love you to be a part of that too.
 If you want to learn about this school or you'd like to apply for the school,
 go to school of supernatural life.org and all the information is there and you can
 apply from there as well.
 You can start your application. Super easy application all done online.
 If you ever need help filling your application or staff or just a click away,
 they would love to help you.
