<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll live in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 So we're still on vacation, living the dream.
 And we'll be back next week<br/>
 to our regular programming schedule.<br/>
 But we hate the thought of not staying in touch.
 So we prepared a few special episodes for you.
 If you missed last week's podcast,<br/>
 Alan interviewed the developers of the app New Bible,
 which is a wonderful Bible app for your iPhone or iPad.
 And if you wanna hear about people passionate
 about their work about Christians who live in Silicon Valley
 or just three happy nerdy people talking
 about thoughtful design, go listen to last week's episode.
</p><ul>
  <li>For this week, we wanted to introduce you
 to a friend of ours called Blake Strand.
 Blake, we've talked about before in the podcast,
 he actually helped us start podcasting.
  </li><li>Yes, he did.
  </li><li>If it wasn't for Blake, babe,
 I doubt we would have even got into podcast.
 I don't think we would have.
 He's a super smart friend of ours.
 He and his wife, Alaina, both former graduates and staff of our school, Supernatural Life,
 have a podcast called White Flag Wealth where they have been having this no shame journey
 into abundance.
 And a while back, Blake came and interviewed me about this whole topic of abundance.
 We sat in this room, actually, and we just chatted back and forth about the nature of
 God, how generous he is, what we're called to live like.
 And he called the episode, "Does God Want You to Be Rich?"
 I wish he'd found a more controversial title for that interview.
 I know.
 I know.
 I really do too.
 And while we do talk about money, we talk a whole lot more.
 I forgot that we recorded this.
 And as a kind of a pre-launch for their podcast, White Flag Wealth, he released our interview
 and a while back I was listening to it.
 And I thought that our audience might like to listen to it.
 You may have heard it already on Blake's podcast.
 If you haven't, we're going to roll out for you now.
 So on my blog, I have this Jesus quote, I have come that they may have life and have
 it to the full.
 So you are the pastor here.
 When you hear that quote, do you, do you think of money?
 Do you think of, you know, just a spiritual fullness?
 What does that bring to mind?
 What does that mean for you?
 Well, that verse, especially that verse, as a long history with me.
 So when we go back in time, when I would say I was absolutely in the negative
 of anything to do with life.
 So I've told the story so many times, but when I was 21 years old, had a nervous breakdown for
 one of a bear phrase. But two or three years later, I'm no longer suffering the symptoms, but I'm a
 shell of a person can't look at people in the eyes, can't have a conversation, can't walk down a
 street for fear that people are going to ask something of me, even if it's the time. I am
 just a completely neurotic shell of a person who is not suffering ongoing mental anguish,
 but I am suffering the residue of mental anguish.
 And I used to have anxiety attacks and panic attacks a lot.
 So that's the quality of my life.
 And I remember waking up one night as I would often do,
 like two or three in the morning, panicking, cold sweat,
 and just thinking to myself,
 this can't be the sum total of the existence
 that Jesus paid for.
 Like, somewhere I had the theology growing up
 that when you get saved, that's awesome.
 But when you give your life to Jesus,
 is all that happens is your eternal destination changes.
 I mean, nothing else, like whatever, whatever is your life is your
 life and you just endure it really, really well until you die or
 Christ comes back again.
 But that verse was the thing that got me thinking because I was
 like, there's another verse where Paul says, having given us his
 only son now will he not give us so much more.
 Like, having given us the most precious thing, everything else
 is gravy is my version of that.
 Yeah, which is funny that he would phrase it that way as if
 that's obvious.
 It's like now that he gave this unbelievable gift, how much more will he just give you
 more?
 Right.
 It's like, oh yeah, I think that would be pretty logical for him to stuff.
 Like, Gary gave.
 Yeah.
 And yet it seems like the transformation at the kingdom of heaven and all its benefits
 is the ground floor.
 Hmm.
 This is what Paul's saying.
 And so that combined with this verse, because I remember waking up really like panicking.
 And I remember quoting that verse back to the Lord.
 Lord, you said you came and gave life in life in London and I am barely living life. Like I am
 barely hanging on. My quality of life sucks. I don't want to be rude. I'm really grateful for
 salvation, but I refuse to believe this is what you paid for. And that was the first time I ever
 thought there's got to be more. And I, I don't know how long ago that was. I was 23 and 14 now,
 So do the math 17 years.
 See that?
 Yeah, math genius.
 Just like that.
 I might even be right.
 But you know, it took me all that time.
 I think that I think since that point, everything in my life has been an upgrade.
 Like Jesus has just been taking an area of my life and saying, is this what
 abundance looks like?
 And that gets uncomfortable.
 So when you ask me what area do I think is historically, most people would say, well,
 these talking about heaven, clearly life and life abundant. But I think heaven begins here.
 Of course, heaven's a literal place, for sure. But I think our job is to bring what's available
 into the natural.
 Yeah, I love that. I love that you have a history with that verse two and that it's caused you
 problems, the good sort of problems. Right. It totally has for me as well. In my initial reaction
 was just I was at a place where I think I didn't really understand how to interact with God,
 didn't really know what it meant to hear God's voice. I put that in air quotes because I didn't
 even know for sure that that was a real thing or if that was just kind of a phrase for lack of a
 better term of understanding your circumstances or understanding in hindsight what was happening.
 And the only way I knew that I could, I guess, feel God, the only way I knew was through conviction of sin, which it was actually like looking back.
 It was just guilt.
 So all he would do is speak to you about the negative in your life.
 Exactly.
 Right.
 That's all I really had an ear for, honestly.
 Right.
 And so I, and I was walking in college, I was like, I'm, I'm borderline depressed right now.
 I'm walking around and when it comes to interacting with God or what separates me as a Christian
 is that I get to feel bad about myself a lot. And then I read this verse and I go,
 "Uh-oh, is that if that is true, then surely this can't be the case."
 Right. And I think that is why one of the reasons the Bible is there is to arrest you,
 really to arrest you and you get to stop and ask yourself, am I living what this verse says?
 And I think probably what's happened in most people's lives is we've watered down the Bible.
 We've diluted our theology and what we think the Bible means to make us comfortable with the
 choices we've made in life rather than using the scriptures to have a higher benchmark,
 which were called upwards to, you know, so Romans 3, 23, all of
 the phones short the glory of God.
 Well, we think, yeah, man, it sucks.
 See, we're all sinners with all phones short the glory of God.
 But what does that verse mean once you're saved?
 Isn't it about time you look for the glory of God that was once
 described to you that we can be living at?
 And that messes with you.
 So going back to the first verse of coming to give you life and
 life abundant.
 When I heard that verse, I was in deficit or debt in terms of
 of quality of life.
 man, I was a wreck. And I think that it was a challenge to realize, Oh, God's not okay with that.
 I think I used to think I used to just agree with fatalism. Whatever is happening right now,
 must be God's will, therefore be the best version of yourself in this.
 Yeah, totally.
 And I don't think that's true. I think that when you have a revelation of where you're living
 right now, it's to give you options of what's available, not to just go, well, this is my
 a lot in life, I guess I'll just be an enduer. Well, why not try overcoming? That seems like
 way more attractive than enduring. You know, given the option, okay, well, I'll just endure
 here in poverty and in sickness and, uh, mundaneness. And I'll just show how good I'm at persevering
 in the midst of this or, or you could look for an upgrade.
 That's so interesting because I didn't ever think of connecting my beliefs right or wrong about abundance with a deeper question of God's will and how do we know God's will and he doesn't God always get his way, you know, and are things happening that aren't his will, you know, a saying that I grew up with was God is in control.
 And what I took that to mean was literally everything that's happening is because God is controlling it.
 Right.
 You know, which I don't blame that on my teachers, but on what I like received from that was,
 oh, my circumstances are this.
 And so.
 Well, it's a very comforting theology because it removes any responsibility from you.
 You just abdicate all choices.
 And it's God's will.
 But plenty of stuff happens that wouldn't be God's choice.
 You know, I love when I teach this.
 I love to walk up to someone in the front row and hit them in the face
 Right, just to illustrate and I just ask people is it God's will that I hit somebody in the face? No isn't and yet it happened. How do you?
 You know people just like
 Yeah, so is God aware of everything that's going on? Absolutely is God the ultimate redeemer? Absolutely will
 Everything in life be redeemed? Yes, it absolutely will whether in this life or the next life absolutely will
 But in the meantime, we've been given supernatural options available to us that are supposed to radically alter your life.
 And if you look at the life of Jesus, that's all he did.
 Everybody he encountered, he didn't say, you know, the lepers of the day, the 10 lepers that come to him and just say, you know, you know, mass would you heal us?
 He wasn't like, sorry, guys, you know, this is just just suffer well.
 No, he absolutely transformed their life or the beggar who was blind.
 You know, everyone want to ask whose fault is it?
 You can absolutely say that they're in the beggar or the leper or anyone's
 interaction with Jesus left them with abundance.
 It's just a byproduct blessings, a byproduct of interaction with God.
 Hmm.
 I can't tweet that later.
 I remember Bill Johnson saying something.
 I remember Bill Johnson saying lots, but I remember Bill saying this.
 It's responsible Christian living to pursue the blessing of God in every area of your life.
 And I that again arrested me because I know people who are really, really blessed.
 And I know people who are really, really not.
 And I was just like, well, I guess it was God's will that they would be blessed.
 And it's God's will that those people wouldn't.
 It did never dawn to me that you can actually partner with God to upgrade your life.
 And I would say upgrade in every single area in your health, your relationships, your thought process, your finances, your outlook on life, your thought life.
 He's constantly interested in giving you life and life abundant.
 I have to admit that there are there is a separation in my mind.
 And I notice a discomfort when the conversation glides from like, for some reason,
 it was so much easier for me to grab ahold of first God's interested in my heart,
 my spirit, spiritual abundance.
 Second, my physical wellbeing and the wellbeing of my family.
 and my ability to live life without just ridiculous pain or something like that.
 And then you throw in with a comma finances and I notice a discomfort where I go,
 oh, and I don't know if it's because maybe when I was growing up, the best Christians were the
 ones who are living with very little. Right.
 You know, and how did that happen? And have you had a discomfort at all when it comes to
 applying that principle to finances or how does that look in your life?
 Oh, undoubtedly so. And I would say, you know, I don't know how I got this, whether it was
 osmosis from the culture I grew up in. But this is what I remember. Like, this is me now using
 hindsight to evaluate what I grew up with. So I don't think I was even aware of it. You know,
 whatever you grew up with is normal. But I come back to that old saying case or us or whatever
 will be will be. So there I knew wealthy Christians growing up and I knew normal Christians.
 You know, whatever you think is normal is your norm. That's usually what you're experiencing.
 And then so I knew people who are richer than my family, people who are like my family and
 people who are poorer than my family. And we didn't think any of those were sinful.
 but will but I do were you to try and move up because then that's worldliness so the notion that
 you could somehow be born a wealthy Christian is okay because clearly god
 you know meant that for you but you should just be grateful for what you have and be thankful
 which of course that's not bad but any attempt to increase or you know steward abundance or
 anything like that well it's probably sinful that i mean that nobody taught me that that's just
 just what I learned totally. And I struggled with that until I don't know the year, but
 I remember hearing a word from Isaiah 61 from Graham Cook. And it was such a good word that
 I wrote down. And I just, it was so starting this mindset that the people of God should
 be favored, which again is like a dah. It's a dah, this side of that revelation. But before
 and I was like, "Should they be though? Should they be though?"
 But Isaiah 61 is a promise about what Jesus is going to do and what he has done.
 And it was from that point there that the Lord started really challenging my thought life.
 So, Luke 15, the parable of the prodigal son.
 You can read that story as I had done for years and never spot the generosity of the Father.
 What you notice is the lavish living of the sun, how he did everything wrong and how the sun restored him.
 And we think, oh, the sun went away and made a mistake, and then the father brought the balance back up to zero.
 But that's not what he does. He's already spent his inheritance, but the father comes back, and with abundance puts sandals on his feet,
 gives him the family ring, which is like the credit card, and basically restores him back to sonship.
 That means that the father is giving out of his abundance.
 What wasn't the sons, because the senator already had a share, he was giving out of his abundance to restore his son to back where he was.
 So actually the story is about the extravagant father, not the wasteful son.
 And I remember that when I remember my laptop, I was given a laptop, I remember it dying.
 I was in Japan, my hard drive dying and it was getting a little bit old.
 and I was guiltily thinking about getting a new laptop, which is ludicrous.
 It was dead. This is what I do for my living. I need a new laptop.
 I'm feeling bad, and my default solution to a broken laptop is to kind of look for
 something less than I need. I shouldn't be... Just this whole poverty mindset.
 It looks like I can scrape together something. I don't really deserve anything more than that, and I'm fine.
 And my first introduction to the extravagance of God, I would say, is I was praying for a laptop and asking God for a laptop.
 And then shortly thereafter, somebody came up and gave me a check and said, "This is for you to buy a new laptop."
 And the check was for $15,000.
 And I panicked because I was just like,
 My first incident was so noble. I remember this steadfast resolve and the somber look on my face as I looked at this check and thought,
 I will reverse tithe, I will spend 10% and give 90% away.
 Now that sounds noble, but it wasn't the Lord, because actually the Lord's,
 I remember the Lord saying, no, that's not what I want you to do.
 i want you to actually spend a lot of it because you need something broken off your life otherwise you're never going to be able to move in the blessings i want to bring you constantly going to be moderating them.
 I can i will give you stuff because you're just gonna.
 You're gonna be uncomfortable with it.
 And so that was i remember the day i remember going to apple store in Toronto Canada i remember just going in and literally have one of those and five of those and eight of these and.
 and coming home with us i don't know what you're into.
 But we all have those idle moments late night where we're online shopping and we just think i want to be like to spec out my dream BMW or my.
 You know a j is constantly looking at kitchen born so that's my wife she's always on williams is a no mama and just dream about the stuff that she could buy or you know so whatever is whether it's cars computers houses.
 Whatever is we all do that thing where we can expect something amazing and i've done that on the apple store and you maxing laptops and here i was in the very real reality of having 15,
 thousand dollars to spend on it was ludicrous and it was horribly uncomfortable and it was like.
 But if you want to live in abundance you have to change your mindset.
 I realize in your story that I've had this kind of belief system where there is a little bit of a discomfort with
 over and above, you know, and you mentioned, oh, I'll spend what I need, you know, what would be just, okay, this is what I need.
 I need this level computer just legitimately to do my work, and anything above that would be
 Oh, yeah, I think of Judas saying like, oh, you know, if we could have used the money
 that was used just to on the board.
 But even that is different because,
 oh, you were washing the feet of Jesus
 with this expensive perfume and he's worthy of all this stuff.
 The, I guess, buzz question that I was thinking of asking you
 was, so does God, does this mean God wants everyone
 to be rich?
 Like, and if so,
 or am I totally asking the wrong question
 And is my desire to not just have what I need,
 but to have, I mean, I guess really that is abundance
 is to have not just what you need
 because people are like, oh, you know,
 I pray you get a job and you drive a 1998 Ford Taurus
 'cause that'll get you from A to B.
  </li><li>Right, and to one another more would be worldly.
  </li><li>Exactly.
 So I would differentiate rich from wealth.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
 And I don't think God is,
 I think saying that God's interested in making you rich
 is too narrow for what he wants to do to you.
 I think God wants to have you living in abundance.
 Rich is such a poverty way of looking at what he wants to do.
 Like rich in itself is so small.
 Because rich is just, what do you call it when it's,
 Rich is contextualized.
 So when my mom and dad come over here to the UK,
 to the US, I beg your pardon, I live in the UK,
 and I drive them from here to our church.
 We'll pass really large, beautiful houses,
 and still not some of the largest houses in Nashville,
 but just large houses.
 And I remember my momma can come like,
 that's disgraceful, like that was her reaction.
 It is disgraceful.
 Nobody needs that much house.
 I mean, she was offended by it,
 but in the same way, somebody who lives in the slums
 India could come on my mother's house and go, that is disgraceful.
 Who needs that much space?
 So everything is relative.
 And that's where you that's where rich trips you up.
 Riches, riches, the wrong is the wrong way of looking at what God wants to do.
 I think.
 And here's why the feeding of the 5000 did not require riches, but you were
 left with abundance, 12 baskets full.
 So the world's way of looking at a problem is we need hundreds of thousands of dollars
 to feed these people.
 The Lord's way of looking at it is I'll take what's in your hand and multiply it.
 And so I live a life way beyond what I physically are.
 Like I am rich compared to the rest of the world's population.
 I'm not rich next to my friend who just made $22 million.
 I'm not rich at all compared to that.
 I live a life that is way beyond my income because God's good and he brings abundance.
 So case in point, we had a vacation two months ago, two months ago, we had some time off work.
 We were going to do a staycation because my budget said, you don't have money to go on vacation,
 which is absolutely right. We didn't want to go on debt to go on vacation. So we had no dollars
 and we were going to stay home. We were not rich to go on vacation. And yet, somebody we have never
 Matt calls me and says, "I know you don't know me, but I know of you, and my wife is
 praying today. These people have never met. I don't go to our church. We would like to
 pay for you and go on vacation, so pay your hotel anywhere in the United States, and we'll
 cover your expenses."
 And so the next day we drive off to a, I don't know, 1,400 square foot corner, you know,
 around balcony unit, two bedrooms, a living room, dining room, marble, counter kitchen tops,
 that we didn't pay for. So we're not rich, but we live a life that is in abundance of what we earn.
 Does that make any sort of sense? It does, yeah. So the world says you need to amass wealth
 like Bill Gates. The Lord says, "Seek first the kingdom of God and all these things will be
 be added to you or what's in all things. I would say all things. That's the definition
 of abundance. I'll take abundance over riches any day of the week.
 That's interesting. I feel even in my own heart going, "Oh, but if I just have riches
 then I have control, you know?
 And if I seek first the kingdom,
 who knows what I'll have to give up along the way?
 And what it will look like,
 you know, what all things will look like to God.
 And do I trust that his all things is
 or the adding of it and the timing of that?
  </li><li>Of course.
  </li><li>You know, will be appealing to me
 and wouldn't it be nice if I could just control it?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I totally see what you're saying
 with the rich being a narrow way of thinking in that way,
 because if I just say God wants me to be rich,
 then I've given myself permission to miss out
 on vulnerable interactions with God that involve faith.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Man, so I have a control issue is what we're learning.
 This is also turned into a therapy podcast, by the way.
  </li><li>Tell me about your mother.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Yeah, I think all of it is mindset.
 It is, I mean, two years ago, I was on vacation.
 and i remember walking from the car back to our apartment that we were on vacation with
 and i remember not grumbling but i remember having this kind of flashback of why do i drive the car
 that i drive and why do i live in the house that i live in and why have i chosen the vacation that
 i've chosen and i don't think it has anything to do with i could afford all those things like
 that's the car i could afford that's the house i could afford i think my money didn't dictate it
 my thought life dictated it and my money followed. I'll tell you why. When I was in
 Toronto, we had no money to buy a house, especially Toronto prices.
 I wanted to the Lord's of this. Alan and AJ, I'd love you to play a little game with
 me. I'd love you to just do an experiment. I want you to take every Sunday afternoon
 and I want you to let your heart dream and I want you to go house shopping. So we're
 like, okay. Like, aside from the fact that that seems like a waste of time because A,
 we don't have any money for deposit and B, we're not sure if we're gonna live in Toronto
 and see like, what is this onto, you know, but we just said, okay, because, you know,
 let's face it, it's not a bad way to idly spend a couple hours, you can just kind of
 wandering around and let your heart dream. So after a couple of weeks, we just, you know,
 we'd go to church, we'd go grab lunch and then we'd just drive around all these developments
 and just kind of wander through show homes and just be like,
 "Oh, this is really nice. And this is really nice."
 After a couple of weeks, the Lord came back to me and he said,
 "Hey, Alan, how's the Sunday afternoon? How's shopping going?"
 I'm like, "Great."
 And the Lord said, "I just have one question for you."
 And I was like, "Huh?"
 He's like, "Why are you looking at properties
 that are $400,000 or less?"
 And I'm like, "That's all I can afford."
 And the Lord was like, "You can't even afford $400,000."
 (laughing)
 So why is it you magically settled on a number that actually,
 You don't have any money in the bank to afford a house.
 So why is it when you're dreaming, you instinctively cap your dreams
 of what you can afford, even when you can't afford it?
 Like that's ludicrous thinking.
 Besides which I told you to dream.
 So that's the level you want to dream at.
 Well, that just a slap in the face because I was like, oh, so somewhere in there,
 I pre-programmed myself to think I am worth this or this is not, I'm worth this,
 but this is the right amount for me.
 And I tell you what, whatever you pitch that it's,
 you're worth way more than that.
  </li><li>Interesting.
 So do you, not to just straight away cut
 to the practical side of mindset,
 but would you say that having a mindset
 that would instinctively, inherently limit
 what you even look at or dream at would change
 the doors that God opens for you or the doors that you step through or, you know, couldn't
 I argue, oh, but wouldn't God just give you this comes back to the, I guess this we talked
 earlier about God's will and that sort of thing.
 I guess a simple way of asking this is, do you think that your mindset has limited the
 blessing of God in your life?
 I would say yes with a few caveats.
 And here's the first caveat.
 God gave me $15,000 check to buy laptops
 when I had a belief expectation for getting spare parts
 and fixing it myself.
 So clearly, God can override our limitations.
 And yet, clearly, in scripture,
 it's clear that people's expectations limited him.
 Case in point when Jesus was in his hometown
 and he said, "Because of their unbelief,
 "you could do no miracles except for a few healings."
 So what's going on there?
 Well, their mindset determined what they got from him.
 So that's one of the paradoxes of the kingdom.
 I don't think universally that applies
 because God can do whatever he wants.
 And yeah, it seems often he loves to cooperate
 with the faith of the people that he's ministering to.
  </li><li>Hmm.
  </li><li>So, but yes, I do, in my own life,
 I think as we have, I think the reason,
 so I think this is what I'd be comfortable saying,
 outside is a general rule of thumb. Yes. Remember blind Bartimaeus? Some of David do not pass me by
 and he comes to him and says, well, what is it you want? So right there, the Lord's like,
 what is it you want? He gives him your choice. Lord already knew he's blind. He could have just
 healed him. But his first question is, what is it you want? We're not comfortable with thinking
 that God's interested in asking us what we want. Wow. I think we're comfortable thinking,
 "Oh God, what is your will?"
 And he's asking, "What is it you want?"
 And I think the answer that he gave
 determined what he got,
 'cause he didn't get healed until he asked for it.
 And then the Lord gives us this really staggering hint
 where he says, "According to your faith, be unto you."
 So let's take that as a premise.
 I think as a general rule of thumb,
 absolutely our thoughts determine
 everything we receive in life, for sure.
 Although God is all parable, he can intervene anytime he wants, I would suggest that the times that he
 intervenes is because you're thinking too small and he wants to teach you a new standard by which to
 think. Romans 12 says we're transformed by the renewing of our mind. The only way transformation
 comes is by thinking differently. So probably the thinking that you have has got you to where you
 are today. And if you want to live differently from today, then you have to learn to think differently
 tomorrow. So yeah, when's your book coming out again?
 So this is all an ad for the upcoming book by Mr. Alan Jones.
 I love all that.
 I would love to talk about what processing or developing maybe the right
 word, a more godly mindset or more abundant mindset has looked like for you
 or does still look like for you.
 You've mentioned, you know, at church, some different things that you do just to
 on a practical level, try and change the way that you think.
 Right.
 And I'll just say as I let your contemplator have a few moments, for me sometimes, oh,
 so I just need to want more, like, better stuff.
 And so what happens is I'll have maybe a expectation, oh, well, I really want this.
 And so that means that God will give it to me.
 And I didn't even realize I had an expectation of a timeline, but actually, I did.
 And then if it doesn't happen, I'm like, wait, I thought that was the secret sauce was just saying what I wanted,
 right, or wanting more.
 And then I deal with kind of the emotions of going, oh, well, maybe God doesn't want me to be abundant or
 so I don't mean to throw too much at you there or to go back into our therapy session earlier, but
 you know, how have you walked this out?
 I think that's a great question Blake and I think it would be very very important to clarify
 this point. I have not arrived. I'm not the sum tool. I don't live in complete opulence because
 you know, I really don't. And I'm an absolute learner on this journey. But I think probably the
 way to change your thinking is change your environment. So hang around people who think like you want
 to think because you tend to become the lowest common denominator of the people you're hanging
 around. So that's absolutely imperative. You know, be around people who think like you want to think.
 Otherwise, you'll think like, yeah, that makes sense. I think you need to take the word of God to
 confront your reality. And to be clear, my my expectation is not in a thing. My expectation is in the
 goodness of God. So I have pursued a revelation of what God is really like, rather than a revelation
 of a Rolex watch and all that's bad to get Rolex watch. Does that make sense? So if you're constant,
 if you're pursuing things, you're going to be disappointed. But if you pursue God, then he's going to give
 you more than you can ask or imagine.
 Huh. That's so interesting. And that's such an important distinction.
 Right.
 And I'm already thinking, so when you're in a situation, let's say you're in a situation where
 you find your circumstance not lining up with this whole idea of, oh, I have, you know, God
 provides for all my needs or I have more than enough and all these things,
 when you're in a time of perceived great need financially, let's say,
 what is your response when you seek,
 when it's obvious to you the thing that you need,
 how do you pursue or expect the goodness of God?
 Or what does that look like?
  </li><li>In the Old Testament, Egypt is often used
 as what we call a counterfeit solution.
 So often the Lord would come and rebuke his people Israel
 for trusting in Egypt or for trusting in horses or chariots.
 basically the strength of man rather than trusting the Lord.
 I think today it is all too easy for me to think about the way God has worked in the past and
 expect that to happen. But that's me trusting in Egypt, so to speak, rather than trusting in God.
 So in this season, we got an amazing prophetic word, four prophetic words from Patricia King
 that started the year. The whole church did. And I'm adamant when I heard it, I was like,
 I don't care if anybody else picks this word up. I'm picking up if you walk into our bedroom,
 you'll see it written all over our walls in our bathroom. So whenever we face situations,
 which we do, and I think that's an important tension as well, the faith is around there
 to upgrade your circumstances. If I lived with a permanent solution, I would never need God.
 So when we're in a state of need where the obvious solution is X,
 I'm of course I'm asking for X. I'm just thinking,
 God, would you just meet this particular need?
 But I'm careful not to dictate how that happens.
 Otherwise, what happens is when I get around my wealthy friends,
 I'm just like, well, faith without hints is dead.
 You know, I'll just let my needs be known.
 And that's just that's just carnal.
 That's just horrible.
 Like that's trusting in them to solve the problem rather than God.
 And he's so creative.
 So it is constant in reminding myself, all right, God, you know, you can work so many different ways.
 You can just turn water into wine.
 You can just have empty jars that you filled up with oil and then I sell them.
 You can just do provision. You can do it all yourself.
 You can give me a new job or an opportunity to work harder.
 There's just a plethora of that.
 But I think, purposing in your heart that like, okay, God, I don't know what to do,
 but I'm looking to you for my solution is where that helps rather than looking to the solution
 for the solution. Looking to the solution and then turning back to God going,
 why would you give me this? That's so interesting and this may be totally unrelated, but
 Can I stop you for two seconds? Yes. I'm just thinking about, I'm thinking about
 but could I explain that horribly? Peter and Jesus go to the temple and the temple officials say,
 hey, you haven't paid your temple tax, right? The temple tax. So what do they need right there?
 So you know, Jesus is a conversation with Peter, you know, who pays the tax, blah, blah, blah.
 That's not that's not the point of interest right now. But the end result, they both agree,
 yes, we should pay the temple tax. What do they need at that point? Money. They need money.
 So the solution to the predicament they find themselves in is, I think a two-drach,
 my coin they need one drachma for him and one drachma for him they need money and god solution is in
 voila here is some money god solution is go catch some fish
 well this is the worst time for us to go fishing and yet he's obedient he goes and does what's in
 his hand peter as a fisherman but they're supernatural provision he catches a fish not only does he
 get the fish for a supper but when he opens up the fish there's a freaking two drachma coin in it
 And he goes and pays them. So that's an example of, you know, Jesus's solution isn't to give the
 thing they need. It's something completely random. And I think part of the problem we don't see the
 abundance is God's solution makes no sense. You want me to go fishing. Like that's just ludicrous.
 I don't think you're hearing me what I need is two dragons. And he doesn't say,
 I'll go and do this and then you'll find this. He just goes, go and do it.
 So that's what I mean about the thing isn't the thing it's the kingdom that's the thing.
 Wow, why do you think God does it that way?
 He's Jehovah sneaky.
 Yeah, but you can imagine what about later on in life when Peter needs some money.
 You can imagine a temptation to go out just go fishing and wonder how many fish he caught
 with the hope that there'd be a two-drag from a coin in there.
 And the takeaway there isn't when in times of need go fishing the takeaway is my God
 will meet all your needs.
 That's so interesting.
 What I was going to say earlier was that I think I maybe grew up this way or maybe I
 just surrounded myself with this sort of thinking of God comes through at the 11th hour always
 and if God's going to do things, I was like right barely, like, oh, we just barely made
 it.
 like there's a lot of times where that's totally the intended purpose of the Lord is to be,
 you know, no, I was always going to come in right here in the nick of time.
 But sometimes I wonder if actually, because what ends up happening in a lot of times is I will come to a certain understanding and then there will be breakthrough or I'll come to, and I go,
 I wonder if I just had changed my mindset earlier.
 If actually I'm putting this whole thing on God's
 always coming in at the last second.
 And I wonder if he's actually more of a planner,
 but if I were to have been, I guess, thinking correctly
 or choosing to open myself up to the possibilities
 that exist if I choose his goodness over a certain
 And result, right strictly.
 Does that make sense?
 Is that unrelated?
 No, no, I think you're right.
 I don't know the answer to it, but I think you could be right.
 I think I think I wonder if when we're our backs against the wall, that's when
 we're desperate and we'll try anything, including changing the way we think.
 Hmm.
 Yeah.
 On a, uh, I'm trying to think a good way to ask this.
 Where the babies come from?
 Yeah.
 Well Blake, it's a special sort of cuddle between a mummy and daddy.
 If you could recommend.
 A resource.
 You better say the Bible.
 Otherwise you're not a pastor.
 Right.
 But has there been another influential speaker, author or an experience even that.
 Has helped you out considerably in this whole area of changing your mindset.
 Oh, there's been tons of experiences, so many experiences of just God, you know, absolutely
 changing the way we think and, you know, it's staggering the way he does that.
 So yeah, there's a wealth of those.
 I think the books have been hard for me to read because I automatically excuse myself
 from them because of my mindset, if that makes sense.
 So rather than reading the books and the books changing my mindset, I come up with
 reasons why this book won't work for me. And that that when you think like that, that indicates
 you have a stronghold. And the only way to break a stronghold is to just ask for it. Jesus's help.
 So I don't know too many books off the top of my head that really did it for me because I was
 like, I think probably, you know, Graham Cook, although he hasn't been teaching about wealth,
 he's been teaching about mindsets. It's arrested, absolutely arrested me. No other way of saying
 of when like, wait, if that's true then, you know, there's that in the next thing.
 But most it's been my need.
 It's been me making stupid financial decisions, then being in a situation where going like,
 Daddy, I need help.
 And him going, let me show you a better way, which is what he does.
 He's just brilliant at that.
 And my mistakes and his solutions have made me think about better ways of doing things.
 So there's good news because most people have made horrible decisions.
 Or most people are making what seem like wise decisions, which are terrible decisions.
 And the Lord's really, really good at, you know, training and teaching and equipping.
 I'm sorry, that's not a very glamorous answer.
 No, I would, I would read widely.
 So because I was so comfortable on why the love of money is a root of all evil and all
 versus about, you know, don't wear yourself out to get rich. And, you know, all the, the go-to
 reasons why Christians don't think they should be wealthy. I would spend some time in the other
 camp, even if I don't agree with them. So let's just go find your most ridiculous
 prosperity gospel teacher. Listen to them, because you know what? They're going to have some good
 points. Like, even if all of it's not right, some of it's going to be right. And, but really,
 it's been around people that don't. So I have many friends who are ridiculously wealthy. I
 remember speaking to a friend of mine who is a very wealthy businessman. And I asked in this
 question, I said, do you ever have a conflict between your wealth and your faith? And he's like,
 no. He said, because if I did, and I said, basically, I was kind of grappling with how much money this
 guy had and how money seemed to come to him so easily. Like it's staggering. And he was
 just saying, I just asked him about what he thought. I don't think I was even smart enough
 to ask him questions like you were asking. I think probably it's not that I was offended
 by his wealth. I was just a front and bottom. I'd never seen so much wealth. And I'd never
 seen somebody walk in wealth so easily and it didn't take him. Let me open parenthesis here.
 you and I both know Gary Morgan from Australia. Yes. For those of you who are listening who don't know Gary Morgan, let me just describe Gary Morgan. Gary Morgan is one of my closest friends, and he's originally from Wales.
 And a very early age.
 I don't know how to put this any other way than he began to hear the voice of God so clearly.
 That if you didn't know better, you would think he's reading people's minds and thoughts. So I have I have lost the number of miraculous times.
 I've been in situations, be it meetings, be it private meetings, be it restaurants, be it airports,
 hotels, wherever, he can go up to people and just say, you know, he might know their names,
 their phone number, their pin number for their phone, and he will tell them insane details about
 their life that God has told him. Now that is a peculiar gift. There's no two ways around that.
 That I only know a handful of people in the world that can do that. And you know, you and I have
 of certain meetings where he is called out people by name and then distinguished between
 them by the spelling of their name and just, you know, told them their birthday or their,
 and it is like, it's an awesome thing to look at. What I love about Gary is he is aware
 it's an awesome gift. He doesn't try and downplay it like, Oh, no, no, it's nothing. Neither does
 he exalt it. Well, I'm kind of a big deal. He doesn't do either of those things. He will
 just sit with you over a bargain go, Yeah, it's crazy, right? It's totally he's as fascinated
 by it as we are. And also he's not selfish with it. So he's more than happy to tell you about how
 he got the gift and how the gift works. And he's not embarrassed by it. It's not a hindrance to him,
 nor is his identity wrapped up in it. He's just aware it's a gift and he's just a normal person.
 And the gift works independently of him. And he can talk to you about the challenges and the
 how to live a normal life with knowing people's thoughts when you're out of it. You know,
 And I found that so refreshing, close parenthesis.
 This, you know, multi-millionaire that I was hanging out with is exactly the same as Gary.
 Like, it's obvious he is loaded to pretend that he wasn't, would be false humility,
 to brag about how much he earns would just be ridiculous.
 So here's this guy who is blessed with the gift of attracting money,
 who's a multi-million dollar, multi-millionaire.
 And he's more than happy to talk to you about how he got, he's not embarrassed by it.
 It doesn't, it's identities not wrapped up in it.
 And it was so refreshing, but so uncomfortable, because I think for most of us, we're uncomfortable
 with our financial status, whether it's good or bad, which is why I think you're amazingly
 writing a blog about, Hey, like does that much damage, Demen does that much I made this month.
 Here, you know, welcoming to my journey of me processing money, and hopefully I can tell the
 story as it gets better rather than it getting better and me writing the story in hindsight.
 I think it's amazing. It requires huge levels of transparency. But this guy had that transparency.
 And I was just asking him, like, well, you know, do you ever feel bad about being wealthy?
 And he looked at me like, but Terb, like, do you feel bad being healthy?
 He's like, what's your alternative to living sickness and poverty? Like, that's more of God's
 will, then you to live the other way. And somehow, see, I thought, no, no, there's a
 middle. Like, you know, God doesn't want you poor or rich. And there is that
 verse in the scripture, you know, where he says that, but he was so accosted, like,
 well, what's the alternative? So you're always going to be wealthy to someone.
 Hmm. I have a friend who is a multi millionaire. I remember in one year, he
 made $22 million. Great, great friend of mine. And yet his job is to invest money
 for high net worth individuals. I don't remember going, "Aren't you a high net worth individual?"
 And he's like, "Not compared to these guys?"
 Wow.
 And so I was like, "Oh, it really doesn't matter where you are. There's somebody always
 wealthier and someone always poorer than you." And so you've got to stop thinking in terms of
 riches. You need to start thinking in terms of abundance.
 And so abundance in how would you define that then?
 Abundance is enough to meet your needs and more so you can meet the needs of others.
 So good. Let's stop right there. Okay, that's great.
