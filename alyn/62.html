<p> Hello Mr. Jones. Hello. How are you? I smell like citronella. You do. Our whole car smells
 like citronella. Because I have been outdoors. You have been outdoors. I posted something
 on Instagram about this evening's activities and our friend Kathy Harrison Toronto said
 were you actually outside or is this a photo from periscope? No, it was my once a year
 visit outside. It's true. And I was the one that was ready to leave and you were like still,
 you know, chatting it up with people and whatnot. But that's because I was empowered by s'mores.
 You are. I'll go outside for chocolate and marshmallows.
 Okay, I'll keep that in mind. Well, welcome everybody to episode 62 of keeping up with Jones's.
 Keeping up with Jones's. There's no jingo ever. You know, one of the things we didn't talk about
 What my memory i have an edge i'm ready to take it probably is and you're borrowing into your skull right i don't say that you have to check me for tix later.
 Why is it why i said i did you're gonna check me with tix you shut out but you expect me to check you for tix to be totally like that type of thing just a minute.
 Any excuse to pretend i'm a doctor perfect i've got a lab coat tweezers and i've even got one of those led like flashlights that go in your head.
 Boy, I can hardly wait.<br/>
 Anyway, have we talked about your paleo non-bread?
 We haven't talked about my paleo non-bread.
 Talk about it right now because it was amazing.
 Well, I made two recipes.<br/>
 One was the paleo non-bread, which has only got three things in it, coconut milk, tapioca
 flour and almond flour.<br/>
 Well, that's four things.<br/>
 milk, tapioca flour and almond flour. That's three.
 But you paused, you said, well,<br/>
 coconut milk, not really strong seed though.
 Flour, almond milk.<br/>
 And the pause counted for one.<br/>
 And then you can, you could do them like super
 plain or you can add things to them.<br/>
 So I added like garlic salt and some fresh garlic and
 some basil and whatever to make it like fragrant.
 It was so good.<br/>
 And to be fair, they don't taste a thing like proper non-bread, but they are very good.
 They're amazing. Yeah, really good. And then I made tandoori chicken, which was also very good.
 It was also paleo. Also paleo. Serves over ice cauliflower,
 which confuses her friend Nathan. You take a picture of it and said, "Oh, yeah, paleo-Indian
 food." And he's like, "That is not paleo food, but it does look delicious." And we're like,
 like, why is it not paleo?<br/>
 He was like, well, paleolithic man, which we now should believe in wouldn't have had
 access to any of those ingredients who were like, no, no, no, no.
 We were talking about like a paleo style diet.
 And then he said, well, that's actually not paleo because you have rice.
 And I said, no, I have cauliflower at which point he was like, yummy.
 Okay.<br/>
 But anyway, absolutely delicious.<br/>
 It was very good.<br/>
 I had people who were listening to last week's podcast asked me this week.
 If I got up, you know, super early and I've continued and I had until the middle of
 week when I had an early deadline or no.
 You stayed up really late at night.<br/>
 That's what I meant.<br/>
 Yeah, I stayed up till one o'clock in the morning to finish it, so there's no way I was getting
 up four or five hours later.<br/>
 Did not happen.<br/>
 But here's what I noticed.<br/>
 I didn't feel any better lying in.<br/>
 I felt horrendous.<br/>
 I wish I'd gotten up.<br/>
 So I'm returning to my getting up early schedule.
 I think I'm going to try it with you this week.
 Really?<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Pride Parent Moment of the Week.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I went to the Apple Store to watch my daughter graduate in air quotes from Apple.
 camp. A lot of parents didn't know about this, but every year, Apple runs a camp again in
 Furt Thomas. Actually, it's the kind of camping I would love to do in an Apple store. Why don't
 they sign me up? That's your idea of camping. And so they run two kind of workshops each summer
 for children eight, I think it's eight to 12. And they run three times a week, an hour and a half
 each day, and the kids get to make their own book, or the kids get to make their own movie, and
 was how would you put it?<br/>
 You mean the actual movie?<br/>
 Really long and unedited and very linear in nature.
 Yes, but hysterical because she managed to film my mother rolling down the hill.
 Who is 80 years old?<br/>
 Yes, my mother was trying to stop Abby in a cart from hitting the fence.
 And at which point she fell over and rolled down the hill.
 But it's that and then about five minutes of just the green hill with no action and every once in a while you'd see Abby sort of in the top corner throwing a ball or something.
 But nevertheless she wrote her own song garage band.
 She did.<br/>
 She imported her own video and I'm just going to teach her how to edit using a movie but still she got a little award.
 She's eight and she made her own movie.
 Yeah, I loved it.<br/>
 So where to go Apple?<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 It's very good.<br/>
 So anyway, the reason I'm smelling of citronella was we were outside tonight.
 Yes.<br/>
 And the reason we're outside tonight was, and it was hosting a Smores and Volleyball.
 Yes.<br/>
 And I was very excited about that event, especially about one thing of that event.
 The volleyball.<br/>
 The volleyball.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I hit a home run.<br/>
 Was amazing.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I scored a couple of goals and go to the quarterback.
 It was pretty amazing.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 People seem to know how to play volleyball.
 Is that a thing that you're taught in Tennessee or not that hard again?
 I've never seen it play before.<br/>
 Maybe I don't know I played in school like regular school class.
 You know the rules?<br/>
 Well, I know the school rules.<br/>
 Yeah. Anyway, it was very fun.<br/>
 We had a lot of people come out.<br/>
 Thank you guys for showing up.<br/>
 Hope you had as much fun as we did.<br/>
 And I hope the smarts were absolutely delicious.
 I only tried one of the brands of chocolate that we had.
 The dark chocolate.<br/>
 Yeah. And congratulations to our team for pulling that off.
 Michelle, you've done an incredible job.
 It was awesome.<br/>
 It was very much fun.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 Would you like to know our topic for this week?
 Sure.<br/>
 Well, last week we were talking about feelings.
 Feeling.<br/>
 And no jingles.<br/>
 Sorry.<br/>
 Actually, we should do a jingle episode where you can just sing your heart out.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Do you want to talk about before we get to our main topic?
 What the problem was with you at church this morning?
 What was the problem with me at church?
 Why did I have to keep tapping your leg?
 Well, I didn't know I was still singing.
 You were repeatedly breaking out into song all morning while past Jeff speaking.
 Breaky on the song is probably putting it a little you were singing out loud it was quiet it was not quiet it was not quite even a word i know if it was not i would have noticed.
 What's that song got in my head it was a great song it was a fantastic friend mccallam claire was in town yes and the awesome job leading worship yes and it just.
 That song i'm going to have which song was it i'll put a link to it in the show notes i can't remember now and then i won't push it in the show notes i think it was the new ceramic balance on your good.
 Yeah oh that one you get okay yeah that one i'll try and find it and then put a link to it in show notes.
 our topic for this week last week we talked about feelings feelings not managed well can lead to
 confusing conversations which more often than not leads to conflict and i want to talk about
 resolving conflict yes why do i want to talk about resolving conflict this week because we've had
 had a lot of conflict this week.<br/>
 Well, the weather system for us to have conflict was perfectly conducive for that
 environment.<br/>
 It is well situated.<br/>
 You are in apps that are happening with your shoulder.
 I am.<br/>
 And as a result, are not sleeping.<br/>
 Correct.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 And you might not be the friendliest version of yourself at this particular
 season.<br/>
 That's probably fair.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 And then...<br/>
 What was gracious or forgiving?<br/>
 Well, I...<br/>
 Anyway, let's move on.<br/>
 And then I had a really busy week at work,
 which led me to the 1 a.m. star,<br/>
 which meant I didn't sleep.<br/>
 And on the day when our conflict started,
 the odds were tied against us.<br/>
 We're both tired, grumpy.<br/>
 We didn't eat well.<br/>
 We weren't exercising.<br/>
 And so it was just--
</p><ul>
  <li>In your morning, the loss of your mother.
  </li><li>And I'm mourning the loss of my mother.
 Yeah, let's throw that in there too.
 But what that means is we're not really extending
 as much grace as we might typically.
  </li><li>Correct.
 And it's important to understand that conflict isn't bad.
 Right.
 In and of itself, it isn't bad.
 It's just a means to getting somewhere.
 But if you've been raised in a family where conflict is seen as bad, or perhaps your version
 of conflict was really, really bad, or perhaps you've been raised in a family where you just
 shove everything down so there's no conflict, you could end up somewhere along the lines
 were thinking that conflict is something to avoid.
 Yeah.
 But that actually produces the weirdest byproducts ever.
 Because if you think that conflict is something to be avoided,
 you start avoiding certain topics of conversation.
 You start withdrawing from people that you love.
 You start hiding your feelings, which in turn is actually communication.
 It's just really bad communication, which will inevitably produce
 the very thing that you're trying to avoid, which is conflict.
 Right.
 Fortunately, that's not the way we do life.
 Neither of us are particularly built to do that.
 No, which means we're quite good at doing healthy conflict, generally speaking.
 Okay.
 I would say this week wasn't a great example of us doing healthy conflict.
 No.
 Well, what would you say about this week in our conflict?
 I would say normally we try and look at,
 before we even end up in a conflict,
 we're trying to look at what the other person's perspective
 might be and to extend grace.
 Right.
 Where this week I would say neither of us did that.
 We just got mad.
 Yeah.
 So normally if we are hurt by, you know,
 something, you know, either I said or you said,
 or, you know, did or something,
 We would usually just respond with, "Hey, babe, can I take a moment just to share?"
 I felt really hurt when I'm explaining it.
 We'd, you know, "Hey, I thought that was kind of an unfair thing, and I'm feeling
 quite hurt by that."
 We'd just express it, probably at that sort of level.
 This week, not so much.
 It was more "ROW!"
 Because we were...
 Yes, and then angry texts.
 You know what?
 Conflict resolution or text message?
 Not a great idea.
 No.
 That never works.
 But at least I didn't text in all caps.
 (laughs)
 I was just fine just saying.
 Texting in all caps or using sarcastic emoji,
 not my finest hour of communication.
 No.
 But we got through it.
 Yes.
 When, when I'm hurt,
 I find that I'm demotivated
 to connect to the person that hurt me.
 But I actually, you know, have come and realize
 that's a complete fallacy.
 If I'm demotivated to connect with you, that's actually a really, really powerless statement
 because I'm basically saying by that action, you have control of the quality of this relationship.
 Like you've hurt me, so I'm now demotivated to stay connected to you.
 Like the only way this can be fixed is if you un-hurt me.
 And that's like ludicrous.
 But when you're hurt, when you're tired, when you're grumpy, that seems perfectly logical.
 You are a big meanie and I'm going to stay over here and defend myself.
 when you're ready to apologize, you can come over here.
 Right. Talk about passive powerlessness. And in case you haven't got the message,
 I'll just lob insults at you to get your attention. My insults actually mean, please come and
 rescue me. I am poor and I'm defenseless and I am weak. But that's absolute nonsense. We're
 very powerful people. We're creating God's image. We have an abundance of resources to
 to kind of bridge the gap back to prioritizing connectedness.
 Right.
 The truth is both of us, we have plenty of power.
 It's just typically that when we're hurt, we don't want to use the power that will be helpful.
 Right.
 One is the other one.
 And the power that's helpful is meekness and humility.
 Let's talk about connectedness.
 OK.
 when we do our marriage preparation, we talk about most people plan their wedding, but never plan their marriage.
 So most people put in all the effort to planning a day and then give comparatively little thought to what happens after the day.
 And what we've decided that the most important thing in our life, the biggest priority for you and I is our connectedness.
 and by connectedness, I mean the free flow of love, affection, value, honor between the two of us.
 And it doesn't really matter what else is going on in life as long as that connectedness is strong.
 And we have learned through trial and error that that is the most important thing in life.
 and so we guard that very, very closely. Conflict, however, is a barrier to connectedness.
 Because when you and I have a conflict or when I'm hurt or offended or I feel misunderstood,
 those feelings that I'm feeling, you don't care, whatever the lies that come tumbling,
 they actually have to be less important than our connectedness. The trouble is those feelings
 of hurt empowered by the enemy are going to vie for the priority. So the priority suddenly
 drops from being connected to me being right or justified or making sure you understand
 how badly I hurt, which is pathetic. The enemy would just love to convince you that being
 right is more important than being in relationship. But actually, true, authentic connectedness
 is the ultimate priority in our marriage. Talk about, let's ignore this week because
 it was rough, but talk about, and we shouldn't say this week was rough, two of the days,
 two of the moments of two days that was full of conflict.
 I can't even remember what the earlier one of the week was.
 So leaving this week aside. What is our normal strategy for coping with when conflict arises?
 So we don't have enormous amount of conflict usually.
 Right.
 I mean, certainly not as much as we did early in our marriage, whatever.
 So I think we mostly agree on most things now.
 And if we don't, then we just say that.
 I mean, I would think there's several times, like as we're driving to work or wherever
 where you or myself will say, "Yeah, I totally don't agree with that, but we can just talk about it."
 And it's okay that we, because the purpose of connectedness is not to ensure that we both agree
 with each other. Yeah. The purpose of connectedness is to make sure that we understand each other's
 point of view. Right. And that gives huge freedom to be individual people.
 What about when we, one or the other of us will rule by some powerless means of communication, logic, reasoning, a raised voice.
 I don't want to talk about it anymore.
 How do you detangle that mess?
 I don't know.
 Usually pray and take care of your own part with God and then kind of wait for an opening.
 depends on on which one of us is sort of doing the hurt and sabotage thing and which one of us
 is doing the wait for the other person thing. Do you want to talk about the conversation that
 we had early on in marriage with the Holy Spirit but didn't realize the other person was having
 the same conversation with the Holy Spirit and was being equally as frustrated?
 Sure. Well, when we used to have arguments, when we first got married,
 we would both sort of just separate and go and have time chatting with the Lord.
 And the Holy Spirit would always take the other person's side with both of us.
 Right. So I'd go and complain like, Lord, you know, this woman you put here with me, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
 And the Lord would always defend you and hold me accountable for my words.
 And I'd be like, are you kidding me? Did you not hear when she said this?
 And then the Lord would say, yeah, but Alan, I don't hold you accountable for what AJ said.
 I hold you accountable for what you said and I would think that was so unfair until
 Yeah until you until we talked one time and just realized that he was doing the same thing with me like just like
 So what about this that's going on with you right now?
 And what about this thing in your heart? Well, that's not very pretty is it and whatever and I'd be like oh
 And that's the super important message that Danny silk shared with us
 That you can't control anyone but on a good day you can control yourself
 Right. But when you're in the heat of a conflict, the last person you're interested in controlling is yourself.
 Yeah.
 You're all too quick to point at the other person.
 Yeah.
 I would say a solution that I've seen some people try and do in conflict that's really, really dangerous, but seems quote unquote Christ-like,
 is when one party absorbs their feelings for the sake of connectedness.
 So a husband and a wife, they have this argument, and the husband and other wife is just like,
 "You know what, my feelings don't matter. I'm going to prioritize the relationship."
 And through some sense of weird-tristed way of thinking,
 they absorb how they're really, really feeling in an effort to keep connected.
 The reason that's insanity is you can only absorb those feelings for so long.
 And then inevitably you'll end up blowing up over something stupid like, hey honey, could
 you pass me the catch up and you're like, what's the problem with the catch up?
 There isn't a problem with the catch up.
 It's put up, put up, put up, put up, blow up.
 So the solution isn't to absorb feelings.
 It's to express what you're feeling in a really, really healthy way.
 It actually takes as much energy to hide and deny your feelings as it does to work through
 them.
 But typically we've got more practice in hiding our feelings than we do working through them
 in a healthy way.
 Yes.
 There's also no chance that hiding your feelings is going to build intimacy.
 you might as well spend the energy and connection or practice in connection. It was funny we were
 talking in the car on the way home and we were saying, "You know what I want to talk about the
 podcast?" and we were throwing around some ideas. I think you had mentioned that we didn't do a
 good job this week on resolving conflict. My response was it wasn't our finest hour in conflict
 resolution. But actually, we resolved it. And we're getting better. Yeah. I mean, this week
 was an anomaly. Normally, we're much, much better. And the important thing to understand about
 conflict resolution is you only get to resolve conflict by practicing it. You can't read a book
 on it and become an expert. You just actually have to practice it. And the only way you practice
 things is be really, really bad and keep tuning until you get really, really good. So if you listen
 This is interesting and oh my gosh, I wish I'd done this before.
 Hey, start now.
 Start now.
 Classes and session and rule now.
 Right.
 So back to what you're saying about hiding feelings doesn't build into missing.
 Right.
 In fact, just the opposite sharing feelings does build into missing.
 So Dan fairly taught us to use eye statements that sound like I feel when so could we instead?
 Which makes no sense till you hear him give an example.
 I thought initially the eye statements were,
 I feel hurt when you're a stupid jerk.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But apparently that's the wrong way to use the eye statement.
  </li><li>Well, who knew?
 Give me an example of an eye statement
 that would be healthy to use.
  </li><li>So something like, I feel hurt and rejected
 when I ask for help and you don't respond quickly.
 So could we come up with a code word
 that ensures my needs are met?
 Right, so the basic elements of an eye statement is I feel and then you have to have a feeling.
 The reason an eye statement is so powerful is you're owning what you're feeling.
 You're not blaming the feeling of anybody else, you're taking full responsibility for
 how you're feeling.
 The when actually has to be a non-blaming observation of the problem from your perspective.
 So like you just said, I feel hurt and rejected when I ask you for help, but you don't respond
 as quickly as I'd like. So we would run into that one where we're like, well, I did it.
 And what I didn't realize was, and this is a codebook issue, you meant one thing I heard
 another, you're like, hey, I need your help. And I was thinking, okay, it's clearly not an
 emergency. So I'll do it when I get around to it. But your point was I never ask you for help
 unless I need it right now, right, which was confusing to me because I was like, sure, I don't ask for
 help with a five or 10 minute warning. I ask for help when I've arrived at the point where I now
 need help for me to keep going which was difficult for me to understand as a man who's in the
 middle of a task.
 Not that I'm blaming me being in the middle of a task on my gender, but my personality
 type is I'd like to finish the task I'm doing before I help you.
 So you would actually modify your could you help me with.
 If it's possible, then I say, babe, when you're when you have a break in what you're doing
 or when you're finished with acts, could you come and help me for a minute?
 But if I actually need you right at this second,
 like the pot's boiling over and I have a bum shoulder,
 so I can't lift this and I go,
 "Hey babe, sorry, I need you right now."
  </li><li>Right.
 And what I learned because that's where the,
 so I feel hurt and rejected when I ask for your help,
 but you don't come.
 And so you've given me a when to help me understand the problem,
 but then you've also invited me into helping provide a solution.
 So could we come up with a code word
 that ensures my needs are met.
 And you didn't just come up with a solution,
 we talked about it, like we decoded the problem.
 Oh, I thought that, you know,
 and we, because the only way you could interpret my actions
 is you're a selfish jerk.
 Whereas the only way I interpreted my actions was,
 it's not a big deal or do it when I'm done, you know?
 So there was just, we were missing each other.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And my head, I've asked for help three times
 and in your head, it's not an emergency
 it'll get done to some time today kind of thing.
  </li><li>Right.
 Basically I'm communicating dishonor by me not doing
 what you want.
 And then I'm feeling completely criticized and nagged
 because I'm not meeting your needs.
 And so it's just this classic example of me each other,
 but using the I statements.
 And by the way, it sounds ludicrous.
 It sounds ridiculous.
 And to be fair, I statements aren't that helpful
 in the heat of the moment.
  </li><li>No.
 No, not at all.
  </li><li>But it's a very, very useful tool to use later.
  </li><li>Correct?
  </li><li>I'm just trying to imagine trying to draft one
 in the heat of the moment.
 (laughs)
 You like all caps.
 I feel like you could not be a more useless lump if you tried.
 Okay, that's not an I statement.
 Okay, well then I.
 So that's an I statement.
 I feel when so could we instead.
 It's the here's my feelings.
 Here's when it happens with a non-blaming description of the problem.
 And so could we here's an opportunity to invite solution.
 Give me some of the most common ungodly beliefs that run through our heads.
 when we're approaching conflict resolution.
 Well, they can be stuff like, well, I've tried to communicate this a thousand times
 before and it won't make any difference.
 Which is called a negative confession.
 Right.
 And you're just declaring the future or stuff like nothing will ever change.
 I won't ever be understood.
 How I feel doesn't matter.
 Right.
 Which is basically absorbing feelings.
 Right.
 you have to push past those things in order to prioritize the connectedness.
 Right.
 It's so difficult because they're very, very common lies.
 And the trouble is if we have a pattern of believing those lies, we have a pattern of
 empowering the liar that speaks those lies.
 Yeah.
 But the truth is connectedness is worth the risk of rejection.
 Yes.
 other thoughts on conflict?
 I like the eye statement.
 I just think one of the conflict resolution methods that I've also used before is that
 whole thing of the five minute rule.
 I used to use that even if there was like, you know, in our small group or whatever,
 if two people were having a conflict, I'd sort of help them moderate that with the five
 minute rule, which was basically one person gets to talk for five minutes, the other person
 has to listen.
 then all they do is echo back what they heard.
 So they're not answering it.
 They're not defending themselves.
 They're just echoing back.
 So when I did this, you felt ex blah, blah, yes.
 Well, now that person gets their five minutes,
 the other person echoes back.
 And usually by the time that they've both gone,
 you're able to go, oh, I see where we missed each other
 and reestablish a connection.
 So sometimes if the I statement doesn't seem to have gotten you there, you could do the
 five minute rule and put a little bit more time in, obviously.
 But I think sometimes you need that more than just one or two statements.
 I think whatever tool you use, if you're choosing to step forward to build relationship, to
 overcome conflict, then it's a good choice.
 Yeah, it's a great choice and it's a vulnerable choice, which is meekness and God is so drawn
 to humility.
 I remember Jeff Dollar gave us this advice, which I think is priceless.
 And he said, when it comes to arguments, he who apologizes first wins.
 Just this other thought is I think in conflict, it's important that you don't demand that
 the person you're in conflict with has matching skills.
 So for example, I would say that you are very, very, very good at forgiving me.
 Like you have a huge capacity to just process offline with the Lord and extend forgiveness.
 I would say I don't have that skill.
 Right.
 And you are much better at apologizing first than I am.
 And I think possibly where we get tripped up is you may be thinking, well, why don't
 you just forgive and move on?
 I'm thinking, why don't you just come and apologize?
 But what I'm doing here is I'm demanding that you process the way I process, which is ludicrous.
 It gives you no freedom to be you.
 Right.
 We should write a book on this stuff.
 You know what?
 We don't need to write a book because somebody else wrote a book and it was amazing.
 Danny Silks.
 Yes.
 Keep your love on.
 If you haven't read that book, we highly recommend it.
 It's an excellent book.
 And it really draws out the truth of prioritizing connection with your loved ones over everything
 else, helping you overcome conflict with love.
 A great tool to go along with that is our Boundaries teaching.
 We have a three-part teaching available on our website.
 You can download that today in MP3 format that helps you, especially if you've been in broken
 relationships helps you understand where you end and another person begins. It helps you
 understand your responsibility in relationships, but we'd encourage you to get down in this
 book certainly and pick up our boundaries teaching as well. It'd be really, really helpful for
 you as you're growing and understanding how you can use these new tools to resolve conflict.
 AJ Jones? Yes. I love you very much. I love you too.
 Plan I apologize for being an enormous poophead.
 You are forgiven.
 Thank you.
 Is there anything you want to say to me?
 No, I already did that internally.
 All right.
 You're ready for a listen question, which is astonishing.
 I don't understand this question.
 It's so long.
 I'll read it to you.
 OK, this.
 I'm going to keep this anonymous.
 The question is, I have a family member who comes over every
 we can with their two children, ages two and five.
 And their children, so they make messes, they get hungry and do stuff that children do.
 The parent, however, sleeps all day or completely ignores us when we try to wake her up and
 just sits on the couch.
 She does not pick up after her children or care for her children even while they're
 here.
 Everyone else either pitches in or leaves.
 And if they leave, the children don't get taken care of.
 We've tried not doing anything and waiting for her to step up and do something but the
 children get neglected.
 We've tried helping her by telling her what to do and giving her advice.
 Her responses go from two different extremes from being completely compliant and agreeable,
 but with no follow through, or playing the victim and throwing herself into a hyperventilative
 panic attack.
 When she comes, everyone in the house feels disrespected.
 stress level immediately goes up when this family walks through the door which is sad
 because she's family and our job is to love her. We've tried setting boundaries which she ignores
 or goes into the horrible self-pity route and tells everyone how horrible of a family we are.
 We want to have some type of intervention where we sit her down and tell how she's affecting herself
 as well as the rest of the family and that we won't put up with it anymore but we are willing
 to help her grow. Her lack of care about everything has resulted in her children ending up in
 the hospital multiple times each and she still hasn't learned anything from it and this worries
 us. We're sick of picking up after her and her kids every single week. We're ready for her to
 grow up. She wasn't taught to be how she is, she was taught the complete opposite and has a wonderful
 mother as an example. I know this sounds ridiculous but how do you call out her identity as a
 wife and a mom instead of calling out the sin. Do you have any advice or wisdom on how
 you would deal with this? Do you think sitting her down and having an intervention with the
 family would actually do anything? She's 25 years old and we're all out of ideas. My
 responder almost completely dies when I'm around her. Sorry for so lengthy but we're
 a bit overwhelmed. Thank you. I'm so sorry that sounds like a gurgantuan of a nightmare
 of a problem.
 I think it's hard to give advice to that kind of question because there's so many other
 things that would need to be known.
 Like, for example, is she addicted to anything?
 Right.
 You know, there's, if you're talking about two kids that grew up in the same home and
 one of them seems to go completely off the rails, then there's definitely something missing
 from their experience with the Lord. Something has happened whether you're aware of it or not.
 I think the first protocol would be to call child services. If the children are neglected,
 and you said that they are, and they've been hospitalized, then the priority is the children.
 The secondary concern is, I think it's your sister, you said. I would probably call child
 services because your sister needs to understand the consequences of her actions. Now, you're not
 doing that out of a punitive step, you're doing that out of care and well-being for your
 nephunesis. And then I think probably that would be, you're not doing that so it's a wake-up call,
 but one of the side effects of that would hopefully would be a wake-up call. And then you can start
 addressing the situation that this woman finds herself in and what is causing her inability to
 parent, maybe she's feeling overwhelmed. I have no idea again, without knowing the situation,
 without knowing the family, without knowing the particulars of the situation.
 But my wisdom would be to prioritize the health and the well-being of the children.
 What's your experiences with interventions in family, AJ? Do they work?
 Well, they did for us. But again, none of us were younger kids
 when the interventions, when we did the interventions, but both of them did work.
 Okay, but she's a 25 year old woman again without knowing her her personality type what's actually going on. It's hard to say with an intervention would work.
 Well, and it's the thing this thing with an intervention is there's there's always a.
 Ultimate to an intervention right so there's always a well here's what's going on this is how it's affecting us this is what's not going to happen anymore and if it does happen we all walk.
 Right.
 So the problem with that is that leaves two children with somebody who's apparently not
 capable of their care.
 My only concern is I don't know what child services look like either.
 I don't know that I don't know did the children necessarily get better care or not because
 I don't know how it works here.
 So I don't know if there's a family member option or anything like that.
 Yeah, I mean, maybe do some research and talk to the rest of your family and figure out,
 gosh, do we want to do this? Do we want to do an intervention? Because if you don't have an
 ultimatum or something that is the consequence of things not changing, there's virtually no point.
 Right. I'm sorry, that's an extreme example. And I feel woefully ill-equipped to give you any wisdom
 Aside from the practical steps that as they point out may not be ideal.
 Yeah. I mean, why don't you chat with your local pastor too, like somebody who knows you or knows your family,
 and get their input or get their involvement, because they're really going to be able to assess the situation
 locally better than we can with a question over the internet kind of thing.
 Brilliant.
 I think that situation is pretty important.
