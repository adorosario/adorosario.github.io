<p> Good afternoon.<br/>
 Most of your Jones.<br/>
 Good afternoon, babe.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 I am quite well.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 Here we are.<br/>
 We are.<br/>
 In fact, here is now the beginning of a song.
 I don't know what we can make a song.<br/>
 OK, let's not make a song.<br/>
 I had many people this week by many.<br/>
 I mean, too, who commented on the fat diet, no longer have a Scottish accent.
 Hey, it's a travesty.<br/>
 That is not a Scottish accent either.<br/>
 That's somebody having a stroke.<br/>
 my aunt Jenny from Wales. I spoke to her on the phone today. And she said that my,
 my cousin, I think it was Ben. Yeah. It said there's something wrong with Alan's accent.
 I had you knew. You used to hope that please. And then I spoke to my friend Rick, who,
 he was very complimented at him and trying listening to you on the podcast. So I said,
 hey, you know, has my accent gone? And he's like, yeah, it pretty much has. And I was like,
 "Well, has it really or is it just that I'm using American words?
 Or is it just the intonation of the way I say things? Or is it, you know, I actually have an
 accent?" He said, "No, you actually have an American accent." Which is so funny because people
 stop us all the time and say, "Where is he from? Oh, I love his accent." But in fairness,
 I'm kind of agree with Rick and Ben. I can't hear it. You can't. No.
 So I thought that maybe I'd speak.<br/>
 Don Donian, what in this particular podcast?
 Or at least Scottish.<br/>
 Baby, Scottish people don't sound like that.
 All right.<br/>
 Tell me about this week.<br/>
 What happened this week?<br/>
 Oh, I don't even know what happened this week.
 Um, what did happen this week?<br/>
 We had a good week.<br/>
 It's been a busy week.<br/>
 I've actually used my computer twice, two weeks in a row of places.
 I go in and meet people and then I leave and forget that I left my laptop last week was
 in Whole Foods.<br/>
 Um, yesterday was at soap appears.<br/>
 I left it overnight, went back in.<br/>
 I've got a lot to say about the honesty of the work in workers in Franklin and Nashville.
 Thank you very much for stealing my laptop when you had great opportunity to write.
 But I think my brain's going somewhere.
 Right.<br/>
 Our dear friends Ryan and Katie came back from the Harvard School in Mozambique.
 Woohoo!<br/>
 So they're staying with us for a couple of days.
 Very fun.<br/>
 And they've got great stories to tell where I'm dinner with them tonight.
 Can't wait to hear about it.<br/>
 We had quite a high social week this week.
 We got to see David and Tammy Molner and their beautiful baby boys.
 Yes.<br/>
 If you've, I would say David's one of my favorite photographers hands down.
 He's so skilled and so talented.<br/>
 And they had some chocolate covered crack, which was amazing.
 Um, caramel, you mean?<br/>
 It was caramel.<br/>
 There's an American thing in Scotland, we say caramel.
 See, there you go.<br/>
 There's your lesson.<br/>
 Caramel with a couple of syllables.<br/>
 What did I say?<br/>
 I said caramel.<br/>
 No, you didn't.<br/>
 You string them all together.<br/>
 No, caramel.<br/>
 I didn't say caramel.<br/>
 That's what it sounds like to me.<br/>
 Wow.<br/>
 We both did the ice bucket challenge.<br/>
 We did. I took it like a man.<br/>
 Yeah, right. You screamed like a girl.
 I did, but it was shocking how quickly it took your breath away.
 It's true. I decided to go for a run first.
 And that way I would feel appreciative of the ice bucket.
 I didn't feel that appreciative really. It was cold.
 You know what? I did appreciate was last night we got inducted into the One Direction
 fan club. We did. Having never heard of One Direction.
 They were actually playing in Nashville this week.
 and one of our friends got to hang out with them.
 So we were like, who are these people?
 We don't know who they are.<br/>
 And so she's like, you don't know who One Direction is?
 We're like, no.<br/>
 So on YouTube, we watched one of their videos
 and bought some of their songs.<br/>
 In fact, we bought their documentary.<br/>
 We did.<br/>
 Which is going to be in 3D.<br/>
 So we're having in One Direction catch up next week
 to learn all about them.<br/>
 And then last week, we were just preparing for our school
 of supernatural life that kicks off this week.
 We're so excited.<br/>
 I am so excited.<br/>
 All our staff were cleaning the school this week.
 That's true. And you found little birdie carcasses.
 I did. That was very sad. I was very sad.
 Yeah. Well, it was disgusting.<br/>
 Bye bye birdie.<br/>
 Listener's questions this week.<br/>
 Bye bye birdie. Sorry. I just...<br/>
 Let's try that again. We have some listeners' questions this week.
 This is a... I'm going to give you advanced notes. This is a tough question,
 and I don't have a great answer for it, but it's a great question. It's worth asking.
 So this question is from Brittany and she asks a brilliant question. She says, "Hi guys,
 I'm wondering about what's happening to the Christians in Iraq. I know I have no right,
 but I'm angry. Why is God allowing these horrific things to happen to his people? My friends,
 mom died yesterday when she broke her neck doing yard work. She loved and served the Lord her whole
 life. If he won't protect them, how could I believe he would protect me? How could he be daddy?"
 So there's actually two questions in that one question. The first is essentially,
 why does bad stuff happen? And more importantly, why does God let bad stuff happen? And the second
 question is, well, how can I be sure God's going to protect me? I'm going to say on the,
 I'm straight off the bat, I don't have a good answer for that. The question of why does bad
 stuff happen in the world? And we have a good God has been debated endlessly by theologians.
 And for those of you who don't know what's happening in Iraq right now, it's horrendous.
 It's absolutely horrendous.<br/>
 It's an incredible genocide and persecution of many people, not just Christians, as the
 ISIS or Islamic State, as they call them now, these extremists are going into cities and
 either murdering people or driving people out.
 Just atrocities happening.<br/>
 And largely the world's media remains silent on it.
 I'm not entirely sure why that's happening.
 Yeah, I mean, you heard about it for like a day or two and now it's almost like it's not happening anymore because it's not anywhere.
 If you want reports from the ground, the Bishop of Baghdad and Canon Andrew White posts on Facebook and that's somebody that you can trust somebody who is there, somebody who's known by many people that we know, we don't know them directly, but we know the people who know them.
 It's just horrendous and so the question comes in like god how does how does that happen and so again i don't have a brilliant answer for you in the answer i do have i'm aware i'm giving in my nice air conditioned home well i don't face any persecution whatsoever.
 but in the midst of whatever horror you see in life.
 We've got to remember that what's going on doesn't actually detract from God's nature is nature and his character as revealed by the Bible is completely constant right.
 It was David Campbell who brilliantly said the Bible is written down for us so that when life is going well we can refer to it but more importantly when life is not going well.
 we can still believe it because it's been written down for us. So the truth is that God is good
 and he is trustworthy. And the actions that we're seeing around the world, not just in Iraq, but
 all over the world, wherever sin is happening, is the very reason that God intervened by sending
 Jesus to actually bring a change. And so we're going to remember there's two very real realities
 going on in all of our lives. There's the fact that God is really good. And there's the fact that
 the devil is really bad. I tweeted earlier this week that few things make sense of this
 side of eternity, especially when it comes to tragedy. Eternal life brings a different
 perspective to tragedy. What I meant by that is if this life is all there is, then the
 brutality of what's happening right now around the world makes no sense. It's horrible. As
 Paul wrote, "If there's no resurrection, then what are we even believing in? If Jesus doesn't offer
 us eternal life, and this is all there is, then we're fools for believing what we're doing."
 Paul came once and said, "We're eternal spirits having a temporary human experience. The point I'm
 making there is that this side of eternity, nothing makes sense. But we have to remember that what
 we're living here on earth is a very, very short term, and eternity, it's up to a very long time.
 we have to have a confidence and a trust that God absolutely knows what he's doing.
 You know, in the life of Joseph, you read Joseph's life and it's pretty horrendous.
 He's nearly killed by his brothers, but instead they sell him the human traffic and sell him
 in a slavery, which point he is a slave working in a foreign land and then he gets accused of rape
 and then spends large portions of his life in prison. And you could be thinking, well, where's
 God in that house, that even possible, that doesn't seem fair. But it wasn't actually
 God that did any of those things. It was sinful people that did those things to him.
 And what you actually see God do is redeem that situation. And there's a famous line
 that at the end, once he's been made the second most powerful person in the nation,
 he saved the nation from famine. And his brothers come and everybody reveals who he is and who
 they are. And he says to his brothers, you know, what you meant for evil, God actually
 turned to good. And so the Bible is full of encounters where people are having some of
 the worst times ever. And if we stop right there, then it's a tragic story, but God brings
 redemption and the story ends different life of Job, for example, even the life of Jesus.
 You know, nailed to a cross in my God, my God, why have you forsaken me? And of course,
 everybody looking at him going, "Oh, save yourself. You saved other people." If you
 just stop right there you go man where's God and that none of it makes sense but you realize
 when you read the whole book actually had a plan and Jesus' death and Jesus' death
 made no sense until you keep reading and you realize his resurrection. So I say all that
 to say is I don't know what's going on I really don't but what I do know is that God
 is still on the throne, he's still in control and he's going to redeem it. Paul, the apostle,
 I was thinking about this verse earlier, 2 Corinthians 4, it's glib for me, as I said,
 to sit here and give that as a very trite theoretical answer, even though I believe it's true.
 But Paul was somebody who had experienced hardship, was shipwrecked and beaten and left for dead.
 And so he says this, it has his encouragement to the church. He said this.
 I'm reading for second one since four verse four, the God of this age has blinded the mind of
 unbelievers so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ,
 who is the image of God. I would say that's what's happened to Isis. Their minds have been
 blinded. And so they're unbelievers. And in what they think,
 they must have been to be able to do what they're doing.
 What they think is God's work is absolutely not God's work. It's not too different from
 Saul was breathing murderous threats out against all the Christians, oversaw the death of Stephen,
 huge persecution in the early church. And yet it was him that the Lord picked to transform. So
 my prayer at the moment, of course, is that many of the Isis leaders get saved to have a revelation
 of Jesus, which is amazing. Anyway, that's not the point I just thought was an interesting one.
 Verse four, verse eight, he says, "We are hard pressed on every side, but we're not crushed.
 were perplexed but not in despair, were persecuted but not abandoned, struck down but not destroyed.
 We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus
 may also be revealed in our body, for we who are alive are always being given over to death
 for Jesus' sake, so that his life may be revealed in our mortal body. Verse 16, we say,
 "And even in all this persecution and all of that stuff, therefore we do not lose heart,
 the outwardly we are wasting away inwardly we're being renewed day by day and he describes everything he's been through the beatings the persecution.
 The imprisonment the being left for dead on the shipwrecking the hunger starvation rejection all of that he calls that.
 Are light and momentary troubles these things he's light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory.
 that far outweighs them all so we fix our eyes not on what is seen but what is on what is unseen for what is seen as temporary but what is unseen as eternal he made sense of the tragedy in his life.
 By looking to the eternal.<br/>
 I don't have a full revelation of any of that like I said I haven't experienced persecution in my life.
 But I'm pointing to what the scripture say is unshakable.
 I've been speaking and you haven't said anything. Do you want to add anything to that or comment?
 I don't know. I understand it's so...<br/>
 We were following this every day and we're praying for these Christians that are going through
 things I can't even imagine. I mean, I can't wrap my head around what they're experiencing.
 But I know that I know that I know that God is good.
 And I guess I keep thinking about one of the verses that the Lord talked to me about a couple
 weeks ago was from Esther when Mordecai is encouraging Esther, you need to speak on behalf of the
 people they're all about to be slaughtered. And one of the things that he says is, if basically,
 if you don't go and talk to the king, the Lord will raise up his people's defense from another place.
 So God's heart is for people that are suffering, for people that are going through horrific circumstances.
 All I can do is just know that God is good and not question that in prey.
 "Oh, God, do something." Again, yeah, get the ISIS leaders saved or just intervene.
 That's our part, is to be praying.<br/>
 I heard another story that in and of itself is this incredible testimony. The reason I'm
 telling this story is for a completely different reason. But we have a dear friend in South Africa
 called Pass a Surprise or Pass a Supraza. And Jeff Dollar, our senior pass, was out with
 Supraza a couple of months ago, a month ago maybe, in Africa with him. And one of Supraza's
 passes that worked out alongside him, Pastor Francis, has an incredible testimony. One evening
 surprise in Francis, they had a conference for the young people in their town. And as he went,
 as Pastor Francis went out in the evening to kind of lock the gates. He saw a group of young men
 and went over to them and said, "Hey guys, is time coming in thinking they were part of the
 conference?" Well, these guys weren't part of the conference. They were thugs who chased him and
 beat him and one of them stabbed him to death. And so, you know, they found a body that called
 the police, he was taken to the morgue. And that story there where it ends is horrendous.
 This poor pastor is beaten and stabbed to death. And that's horrendous. The other end
 of the story is Pastor Francis came back to life. The other pastors were praying for him,
 and he said he woke up in a body bag in the morgue. And when he unzipped a body bag,
 was no stab marks and obviously the poor corner.
 They were healed marks.<br/>
 They were healed.<br/>
 Yeah, they were healed marks.<br/>
 The corner was freaking out.<br/>
 And the first thing Pastor Francis wanted to do was go to the police station to extend
 forgiveness to the man that had killed him.
 And so he went to the police with Pastor's praise and said, "Oh, we're here to release
 these men."<br/>
 And the police were like, "You can't release this man.
 This man's held for murder."<br/>
 He's like, "Yes, I know I am the man he killed."
 I don't know quite the proceedings of how it went, but anyway, Pastor Francis went and
 spoke to this man who was terrified because he thought this was, you know, Pastor Francis
 goes coming to haunt him, but he came to him and said, "No, I've come to forgive you,"
 and told him about Jesus, and this man breaks down into yours, gives his life to Jesus.
 Now, present day, he is serving as a pastor, the man who murdered Pastor Francis, now himself
 a pastor.<br/>
 So, the reason I'm telling that story isn't even to illustrate, "Look, God redeemed
 it because that's an example of redemption, this side of life, which I'm sure there will
 be many in the years to come from Iraq."
 But of course, also, sometimes God redeemed stuff in eternity.
 My point rather is to hear of somebody being beaten and stabbed to death is horrendous,
 but from pastor Francis' perspective.<br/>
 He said, "All I remember is going over to these young men, and I remember them chasing
 me."<br/>
 He said, "And I remember being very weak because I'd been fasting for days before."
 And he said, "So I remember running, and the next thing I knew," he said, "I realized
 I was running in the air."<br/>
 And he said, "And as I looked down, I realized there was my body, and I saw them beating
 my body and stabbing my body."<br/>
 He said, "But I didn't feel anything because I was running."
 He said, "And the next thing I knew I was in heaven."
 He said, "You know, and he had an experience in heaven."
 He said, "And the next thing I know is I can hear Pastor Sorese's voice praying for me."
 He's like, "Oh, Pastor Sorese is here too."
 And then the next thing I remember was unzipping the body bag and finding myself in the morgue
 and being really confused as to what happened.
 As you would be.<br/>
 Yes, you would be.<br/>
 But as amazing as that story is, the comfort I found in it was that the man,
 being beaten and stabbed to death, he was unaware of it.
 And it made me think about that, we referenced it earlier in Acts where Stephen is being
 stoned and it said that his face illuminated and he could say, "Father, forgive them."
 And you think, well, how could you say that?
 But I wonder if he was having a similar experience where he was so caught up in the glory of
 Jesus that he wasn't aware of his sufferings.
 I have no clue.<br/>
 I'm not building a theology out of that.
 It's just what I thought of upon hearing Francis' story.
 "What would you say to somebody who is asking the question, 'How can I be sure that God
 is going to father me?'<br/>
 And how can I be sure that he's going to protect me?"
 I think it's his nature.<br/>
 You know, God, he's a great dad.<br/>
 If you think about you as an earthly dad, it is your desire to protect your kids from
 every single thing that you can.<br/>
 And there's going to be moments where you couldn't protect them because you weren't
 there or whatever, which isn't exactly the same with God, obviously.
 Of course.<br/>
 But you can still comfort and restore.
 So I think often we don't understand, I don't understand why some things happen the way
 that they happen.<br/>
 But I know that God's good and he's big and his heart is for us.
 And I've experienced too much of his goodness to question his thoughts towards us.
 That's a very good answer.<br/>
 My response to that, though, is when I heard you share your testimony the first time we
 met in 1993, you spoke for five days at my school, you were the teacher.
 And Monday through Friday, every day, there was a new level of trauma that you were talking
 about that you had sustained.<br/>
 And I was thinking, how on earth did you endure that?
 So Mike, I'm playing a little bit of devil's advocate here in that I absolutely agree.
 I know that God is good.<br/>
 I know that he's kind of, I know that he's loving.
 But how did you, who is somebody who endured such torment and abuse and abandonment and
 trauma growing up?<br/>
 How you know, surely you must have had times of like, well, where was if God loves me,
 why wasn't he there?<br/>
 All the time.<br/>
 So my question then is, you know, you're experiencing that and you're thinking that and now you're saying many years later, you know, God is kind and he's wonderful and he's perfect, which I agree with.
 Of course, you know, the Bible has to be the standard, not our experience, but talk to me about your journey into a revelation of the goodness of God.
 Well, gosh, I mean, it's on one level, it's really hard.
 And I love it.<br/>
 It's really easy because God brought me to a revelation, do you know what I mean?
 But, but, what do you mean by that?<br/>
 I really feel like he, he directed it.
 Like he, he got my attention.<br/>
 He kept my attention and then he brought healing.
 It's funny because even when I think about, you know, a lot of the stuff from my childhood
 and losing my dad and all that kind of stuff and all the trauma. God has so removed the
 pain from that that I don't feel the trauma anymore. Do you know what I mean?
 I do. I remember one day you were sharing some news with me about, "Oh, I just heard
 it so and so." Her husband left her and he ran off of somebody else. My heart just goes
 I was out there like, I can't even imagine how hard that would be.
 And I had to stop you and go, you do remember that exact same thing happened to you.
 And you were like, oh yeah, yeah, I did.
 But that's what I mean.<br/>
 God can so fully heal your heart of things that there's not even a shadow of it.
 Right.<br/>
 It has any kind of power over you.<br/>
 I haven't forgotten.<br/>
 It's just that it's not.<br/>
 You had then.<br/>
 Well, no, I hate those two.<br/>
 But you know what I mean?<br/>
 I haven't forgotten the stuff that I've been through.
 It's just that it holds no power over me.
 Right.<br/>
 And that is a testament to the goodness of God.
 Goodness of God, for sure.<br/>
 Because I think many people would probably point
 at the trauma that you endured and go,
 well, where was God in that?<br/>
 But back to my point is God's not done yet.
 Let's just watch out for a good life.<br/>
 And the thing is, is hurting people hurt people.
 And I had a lot of hurting people in my family
 and around me.<br/>
 Do you know what I mean?<br/>
 And so, I mean, you can give the answer of,
 well, everybody has free will and that's true.
 But the thing is, as much as I went through that stuff, I still feel like God kept me.
 I'm here.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 But what's important to understand is it's not that a lot of people say, "Well, yeah,
 God allowed that to happen."<br/>
 You know, therefore God...<br/>
 Well, somebody planned it to happen, I was it.
 Exactly.<br/>
 Yeah, no, there's lots of stuff that happens on the earth today that he's not happy about.
 And I'm sure he weeps.<br/>
 I mean, I'm sure he weeps over the things that people are going through.
 But there's redemption in Jesus.<br/>
 always. All is said and done. Everything gets straightened down in eternity, which is just incredible.
 Yeah. When you were talking earlier about Joseph, the verse that I used to hang on for
 dear life really was that Romans 8, 28, for we know that God causes all things to come together
 for good for those that love God and are called according to His purpose. And I remember many
 times just being like, I feel so overwhelmed by life. I don't know how I'm going to navigate.
 This is so painful and I would just repeat that over and over and over again
 And for I know that God causes all you know
 I don't know how you're gonna turn this horrible thing around for good
 But I know that you will because it's your nature and he has right over and over and over again
 So that's my hope for people and I rack you know that's I I know that he's good and I can't
 Understand what's going on right now, and I can't even my heart can't even go there
 I mean, I could weep, you know, but I know that he's good and I know they're going to be able to stand up and say he's good too.
 Right.<br/>
 The, um, yeah, I think the important thing when you're overwhelmed, like I saw something on Facebook this week about that.
 That I wish I hadn't seen.<br/>
 And I remember just sitting in the car park of a grocery store on whatever night it was Wednesday night.
 Just, you know, in the car, it's going to God.
 I don't even know how to pray other than Lord, would you redeem this situation?
 Would you reveal your salvation? Would you reveal your great power? Would you? Because you can feel
 overwhelmed, but that is why God wrote the Bible down. So that in our moments of overwhelming,
 we know the truth and we're not persuaded to think something contrary to his nature.
 I was thinking earlier about how important it is to settle our heart on the goodness of God.
 Because if we don't, we will constantly be buffeted around by what comes our way.
 Like if we have a good day, then God's good, but if we have a bad day, then where was God?
 And I think that's the wrong way of looking at life.
 I think the proper way of looking at life is having a revelation of the love of God,
 which then allows you to temper every experience that comes your way.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Christa Black had a great, great quote about that, didn't she, a few weeks ago?
 I don't know if I'm going to get it right.
 So you're going to look at Apple.<br/>
 I'll look up.
</p><ul>
  <li>I hope you'll.
  </li><li>But she said something like,
 if you don't actually understand
 or believe in the goodness of God,
 you'll lower your theology to match your experience.
 I mean, it was something to that effect,
 and I just thought, yeah, that's exactly right.
 And that's how a lot of people's internal theology
 is about God get written, is, if I can't explain it,
 then I need to lower my theology to encompass it,
 which I think it's okay to be able to look at something
 and go, I don't know how this matches up
 with your goodness God,
 but I know you're good and I'm not going to change that about you.
 Right. And I'm looking forward to the redemption that you bring. Right.
 Christ is actual quote. And this was mere weeks after losing her little baby girl,
 which I mean, we're so proud of you, Christa, for the way you have navigated both you and
 Lucas are just absolute heroes. But she said this, if you are not anchored in the goodness of God,
 you will lower your theology to match your pain.
 Yeah.
 So for you then, how, when we were talking earlier about the goodness of God,
 and I realized that, you know, from 1994 onward, you were just, even though you were broken and,
 you know, in your current emotional state, you were living with one of the most incredible
 manifestations of the presence of God, the world has seen.
 Yes, that helped enormously.
 So talk to you about what that was like.
 I mean, I really probably wasn't until '94 that the Lord started really working overtime
 with my heart isn't the right expression.
 But just, I mean, I felt like healing, healing of my heart was coming very, very quickly
 in the presence of God.
 And so it was daily encounters with the Lord and with his goodness, with his love, where
 I just couldn't argue that he was there.
 He was present.
 He was showing up and he was removing pain.
 There was lots of random things like dreams and encounters and visions and stuff like that.
 There was also just sitting in his presence and feeling that love that just heals.
 I got probably years worth of, which should have taken years worth of counseling and moments
 just because the Lord is so good.
 And he knows exactly what we need.
 He knows how to heal.
 So can you think of any of those examples?
 I'll let those visit.
 Hey, who's of God?
 What God did something you knew you, you went in one way and you came out of the other.
 Yeah.
 Gosh, I guess one I could think of is right near the beginning of the renewal.
 So you're, you know, early 94 when I was still sort of like, Oh God, I don't
 understand this and I don't know why you move this way and it's kind of messy and all that kind of stuff.
 And I was still really struggling with my dad's death, like hugely struggling with where is he even
 though I knew the Lord had told me that he had given his life to him and I had had this whole.
 Anyway, I mean, the Lord had told me and then Mark DuPont had given me this word and I was like,
 "Okay, I should know, I mean, I should know in my head,
 but I still was so owning that I should have been the one
 that led into the Lord or something, you know,
 that I couldn't let my heart be at peace with that."
 But then, so we're in the renewal
 and the Lord shows up, you know, time and time again.
 But this one night,
 one of the pastors came by and prayed for me
 and I fell over and I went immediately into a vision.
 like just, and the vision was of my father killing himself.
 And I'm watching this vision of him killing himself.
 It was horrible.
 Oh, yeah.
 And then, and so I start screaming and I'm in, you know, I'm in a church.
 So I'm screaming, no, no.
 And I sit up and I come out of the vision.
 And so this pastor comes over and this is at the Cambridge Vineyard at the time.
 So this pastor comes over and he's like, you know, can I pray for you again?
 And I went no because I was just like, you know, traumatized and and
 He said just can I just pray for peace and I said fine peace
 You're the only word you're allowed to say is peace and he was like okay, and he so he did he pray for peace
 and I fell out again and
 but this time and I went back in the same vision, but this time Jesus was right next to me and
 You know when I was crying Jesus was crying and then when my dad was actually dead in the picture
 Jesus went over and picked him up and walked it look looked at me smiled and walked out of the room with him and
 I remember thinking
 Okay, Lord from now on I choose to believe that you have him right and
 There was so much healing in that simple little thing that I mean it could have taken years of
 counseling to work through and it was just like in an instant the Lord said hey
 Let me make this super clear to you. I've got him right
 There was so many like just
 crazy moments of God reorganizing the way that I
 related to him or thought that he related to me or you know
 getting rid of striving and you know, they're just like
 Your constant canvas for God to sort of reorganize things and remove all of your theologies based on pain, right?
 There was a lot of kind of hard work that got done and there was a lot of crying, but it was awesome and that was all
 Experiential all experience and you weren't thinking I'm gonna go to the church tonight, and I hope that God will fix this
 No, I mean I was just going to church because God was showing up at church. So I just didn't want to miss it
 You know you were just constantly changed by experiencing that yeah, and I would say it was there stepping stones
 You know there was a few moments like that one that were sort of bigger chunks, but
 It was almost like daily stepping stones
 Getting a little bit closer getting a little bit closer and a little bit fuller and a little bit less pain a little bit more hope and that kind of stuff so
 That's what I love about him. He's so good. He's so
 Persistent in his goodness towards us
 That it's incredible
 Now I think of my in my journey into understanding the goodness of God
 It sounds like you had
 experiential
 Encounters with the goodness of God that you then had to process and understand
 Yeah, but I think also because I'd had experiential encounters with the absolute
 horrificness of life and so God was in like
 He was changing experience for experience. Right.
 That's interesting. Mine was almost the opposite. I mean, obviously my life was
 devoid of the trauma that you experienced. Thank you. But my revelation of the goodness of God
 started with a thought.
 Like I had to start, you know, in Romans
 Paul writes about we were transformed by the ruling of our mind. And so really I would read stories
 Specifically from Graham Cook, I remember one prophetic word that Graham Cook gave from
 Isaiah 61.
 And when I read his whole sermon and the whole prophetic word, it was too good to be true
 that I thought this can't be right.
 And I actually had to make a mental decision to change what I believed about God.
 And that coupled with the dream I had, a really significant dream that I had about, in essence,
 the goodness of God, made me then change the way I thought.
 And because of the way I thought was different, I began to believe different things about
 God.
 And then I began to see the fruit about what I was believing.
 Yeah.
 Now the truth is we always see the fruit of what we believe.
 We just don't often realize it.
 And I realized that for most of my life, I'd never been in touch with the goodness of God.
 You know, of course, God is good to Bible tells me so that was the sum total of my theology
 about the goodness of God.
 Right.
 But beginning to understand what was available to me through his goodness changed the way
 thought about him and changed the way I thought about the experiences I was having in life or what's available to me.
 And I would say this was like a nine, ten year journey of constantly being upgraded in the way I thought about God.
 And as a result, the fruit that I would experience.
 The point now where it's not uncommon for people to speak to us and just say,
 some of the stuff that you experience in your journey with God isn't stuff I've ever seen.
 And I can completely understand because I used to, you know, usually that indicates how we're thinking about God or what we're thinking about God.
 For example, for example, God can do or will do or wants to do.
 Yeah, for sure. I think my theology for most of my life was case or asra, like whatever will be will be.
 That's not theology. That's a song.
 Right. But basically in essence, anything that happens must be the will of God.
 One, I don't agree with that at all.
 Right.
 You know, I could come over there and punch you in the face.
 That isn't the will of God.
 It's not his heart that I would beat my wife up, but there's plenty of wives who were beaten up by their husbands.
 Right.
 I'm sure there's lots of time we're falling short of living and when his actual will for us is daily.
 Yeah.
 So the renewing of the mind is a huge deal.
 I wrote an article this week or posted an article this week called "How to Be Utterly Awesome"
 and my sister summarized it. I mean, she summarized this whole brilliant article in one line where
 she said your attitude determines your altitude. So again, what you have is the direct result of
 what you believe. All right, I feel like we're getting started talking about this, but we've
 We've already been talking for a long time about it.
  </li><li>And I can hear MJ.
  </li><li>Yeah, maybe we need to come back to the teaching
 or speaking or talking about the goodness of God.
  </li><li>Because there are cuddles to be had.
  </li><li>There are a nox sexy cuddles, unfortunately just.
  </li><li>No, little baby boy cuddles.
  </li><li>No, no cuddles, so great.
  </li><li>All right, closing thoughts for you this week.
