<p> I'll in an AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes, sir.<br/>
 What people can't tell is that your shirt matches my shorts.
 It's true.<br/>
 They're the same color.<br/>
 And we can have our color coordinate,<br/>
 even though we didn't plan it.<br/>
 It's true.<br/>
 And you're wearing shorts, which I might find slightly distracting.
 You just ran yourself away.<br/>
 Just--<br/>
 See how close I am?<br/>
 Nobody would have.<br/>
 You just have the best knees ever.<br/>
 People, I have the best knees ever.<br/>
 And legs just in general.<br/>
 And legs just in general.<br/>
 I have to ask him not to wear shorts when he's preaching in the summer because I can't pay attention.
 I'm not sure you pay attention.<br/>
 Anyway, I pay attention.<br/>
 Oh, you do.<br/>
 Absolutely.<br/>
 You're so adorable.<br/>
 Give me a weekly catch up because a holy mother of Pearl.
 This has been quite the week.<br/>
 It's been a crazy week.<br/>
 It's a kids last day of or last week of school.
 Last day of school today.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 As we record this.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And so every, I feel like they've never done this before,
 but because of COVID and Boba, every single class,
 so, you know, MJ's, Antias and Abbe's all have done a bunch of extra activities.
 Which is really sweet they've done that.
 Right.<br/>
 To sort of celebrate and let them have little extra parties with their friends.
 Yep.<br/>
 But it's meant that every night this week, there's been at least one and
 sometimes two events to go and like divide and conquer and you know,
 whatever. Well, last night we had a celebration graduation. Sorry.
 Yes. Six grades, no, fifth grade graduation or grade.
 Fifth grade. Fifth grade graduation going from.
 Elementary school to middle school. That's right. Yeah.
 And we also had eighth grade, which is Abby going from middle school to high
 school. Yes. And there were same night, we had to divide and conquer.
 same night, same time.<br/>
 Me and MJ went to Tia's graduation, which actually, as I'm not a fan of the just the
 passing of time, like, "Yeah, it was actually really good." And it was really moving. And
 I almost shed a tear at it. Oh! Yeah? Well, the vice principal did shed a tear and it was
 very touching. Yours was like half an hour long. 40 minutes. Mine was an hour and 45 minutes.
 And outdoors. Yours looked well-touring. Hot mine was an air-conditioned auditorium.
 And so here, but here's what I was figuring out while I was sitting there in the heat on a stadium bench.
 There's people that come really prepared for this stuff.
 On that note, and I tweeted this out.<br/>
 Is that southern culture confuses me?<br/>
 I've lived here, what, 12, 13 years?<br/>
 The first time I went, I'm speaking in general terms.
 We're actually going to a wedding tonight so we can test my theory.
 No pressure, everybody who's going to the wedding who won't hear this in time to even hear.
 Anyway, my experience of weddings in the UK where I grew up is no matter whose wedding is,
 when it's happening, everybody was dressed formally. You would always dress formally.
 All the weddings I've been to in the south here, in the Nashville area, is I'm shocked,
 not like I'm passing judgment at all, just shocked at what people wear to weddings,
 like people don't seem to make an effort. There, of course, are people in the bridal party,
 yadda yadda, but generally speaking...
 I think it depends on what generation is attending the wedding.
 I'm just saying, generally speaking, I wasn't prepared.
 It's not the effort that's made in the UK or even Canada, the same thing.
 You dress up for stuff like this.<br/>
 You know what, let's just keep my country at the time.
 Yeah, all right.<br/>
 But fifth grade graduation, everybody was dressed smarter and nicer and more formally
 at the fifth grade graduation last night than most of the weddings have been.
 Which you threw on jeans and a t-shirt for?
 I went in shorts and flip-flops.<br/>
 Nice.<br/>
 No, I felt great.<br/>
 I wasn't graduating, I didn't care.<br/>
 And MJ was in a t-shirt.<br/>
 But Tia looked really pretty.<br/>
 Tia had a nice, flown dress,<br/>
 and all her teachers commented on how pretty she looked.
</p><ul>
  <li>There was a wide range of people dressing,
 'cause we were outside in a stadium.
 So some people were legit dressed up,
 and then other people were pretty much like me,
 jeans and a t-shirt.
 But I mean, I think, I don't know if this kind of stadium
 seating is used in a lot of places where people brought
 with their own seats that attach to the benches
 so that they have a back to lean against.
  </li><li>That is smart.
  </li><li>So many people had them though,
 like not, like they were everywhere.
  </li><li>Well that's probably people who are used
 to being at athletic events
 and know what bleachers are gonna feel like.
  </li><li>Oh they're probably like parents
 who have kids that do sports.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Right, yeah, as opposed to us who have them
 who do them on like the Wii U and--
  </li><li>Well update, the Wii U, what decade is this?
 Update everybody on the swim team.
 Oh, oh, yeah.
 So I--
  </li><li>Just a quick recap.
 Last week, we were all very excited
 because A.J. had signed up all the kids
 for our neighborhood swim team.
  </li><li>Well, I was--
  </li><li>Attempting to.
  </li><li>I was attempting to.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And they said what?
  </li><li>I just, well, I thought I should ask a couple questions.
 And so I had asked about skill level,
 like what skill level, and they're like,
 oh yeah, all skill level.
 So I was like, could you be more specific?
 Like, you know, 'cause I'm just thinking they can swim,
 but really, they all kind of look like
 gracefully drowning and and so the person emailed back and said well they'd need to be able to
 swim the 25 meter length of the pool you know on their own without stopping kind of thing.
 And I was like and all three are out yeah so I did tell them and Abby just said hey could you
 work with me this summer so that I could do that great. So yeah I'll I'll work on that with the kids.
 Okay, so maybe it's a year pause. I had some excitement and mild internet drama yesterday.
 Yes. I discovered that my credit card, and what's curious about this is an apple card. Now,
 I think it's only America that has the apple card. I think so. I'm looking at Chris as an apple nerd,
 but I think so the apple card is a credit card from Apple in partnership with Golden Sax,
 who are the bank behind it. But what's unique about it is they give you a card that has no
 credit card numbers on at all. I, to this day, I don't think I've ever used a card at all.
 The card has got locked away in my drawer. Right. And so it's a virtual card that you only use on
 Apple Pay, you know, were you like, touchless? Yes. And so to my shock yesterday, I got a notification
 that my card had been used at Uber Eats, which is not unusual because we eat at Uber Eats,
 but we were both home. We were both home. I was sitting in a hammock and I was like,
 well, that's weird. So I looked at it and then realized this week alone, it's been used four times.
 So Apple has this Apple chat.
 It's just basically like text message, Apple business chat.
 So I just reached out to them to say, hey, I've noticed four unauthorized charges.
 Uber Eats only used at one place, which I thought, listen, if you're a criminal and you
 stolen somebody's credit card and you realize it's working, go hit up some other retailers other
 than just Uber Eats for, you know, a sandwich or a curry or whatever.
 But I was curious they'd only use it.
 anyway, they instantly were just like, no problem. We've, we've
 instantly updated your card, which meant because it's a virtual
 card, they just change on that for a second.
 instantly. Yeah. And they said, you know, you'll be refunded for
 all those four charges are clearly not yours. They said, why
 you reach out to the merchant? So I before I could even reach out
 to the merchant, I just was on Twitter, because of course I am.
 And I just happened to retail what I just told you. Well, before
 I could even reach out to Uber Eats, they contacted me saying, Hey,
 We're so sorry this has happened get in touch with us. You know DMS your details. So I did and instantly a new breach at
 Pops up. Hey, we're so sorry to hear this. Can you give us some more details?
 What were the dates of the charges how much were they for?
 You know, what's the last four of the card that was used sent it and they were like, oh, yeah
 It's being used and they told me they said according to our privacy policy
 We can tell you the first name of the person who's been using your card
 Yeah, can you tell us if you know this person?
 I was like I do not and I've not authorized my car to be used and they were like I was like the Internet's wonderful within about an hour
 they'd worked out who was using my card.
 In between that, I had deduced,
 at least I think I deduced.
 When you use your Apple card,
 this is the podcast gold, by the way.
 Everybody is wanting to be your tool.
  </li><li>Well, I have lots of internet shopping stories
 this week as well.
  </li><li>Well, the thing is when you scan with Apple Pay,
 you get 2% back in cash or 3%,
 which is actually Uber as a thing, whereas 3%.
 And I know it's only getting 1% back
 on this, you know, on the little apple wallet thing. And the 1% is only when you don't use apple pay,
 but when you use the card in person, or the numbers are manually entered. Well, of course,
 I have the card. So either this person skimmed my numbers onto a fake card. But with subsequent
 information from Uber, they said, no, they used them in the app. They must have just entered my
 card numbers. So I don't know how they got my number. I don't know how they got my number.
 But God bless Apple.
 They just instantly turned off and Uber is.
 They already know who this guy is.
 I don't know what's going to happen.
 But there was my internet drama short lived.
 Yeah, a series of three tweets.
 I actually love the apple card because I actually contacted them and said, Hey,
 something I ordered over a month ago hasn't arrived.
 I have emailed the retailer.
 The website's now gone.
 I think I've actually been scammed.
 I'm kind of bummed by that because I've bought a lot on the internet for the last
 year and never had this problem, but I got scammed.
 But within one second of me looking at the website address that you ordered it from,
 well, that was the address. What you looked at is the communication that came back was awful,
 but that was after I contacted them and said, where is the stuff? And the actual website is
 gone that was and it didn't look funny. Didn't look janky. No, it didn't. Okay. So I was like,
 all right. Anyway, yeah, you reply like it went through Google translate from one language into
 English. It did. And I was like, that was what I was like, I think. So anyway, they're, uh,
 they're taking care of it. But the good, the good point with that is because you used apple
 pea. Yeah. They won't have access to your credit card. They don't have my card. Yeah.
 So you don't need to worry about that. So I'm still curious as to how this person got my
 my card. And then I bought one other thing off the internet, which, um, these are called dip
 nails. You know, they like they dip them in. They're kind of like gels, but they're like,
 and you're supposed to do it yourself.
  </li><li>Don't skip, listen, if I'm gonna go into detail
 about Apple Card transactions,
 (laughing)
 there's probably another small segment
 of our audience who will be fascinated by this.
 Explain it to me, like I know nothing about women's nails.
  </li><li>I don't know them, so I guess I'm cheap.
 I don't wanna spend $40 every two or three weeks.
  </li><li>That's because you don't like other people touching you.
  </li><li>To get my nails done.
 Well, I don't want them to mess with my nails, no.
 I like the way I do my nails, yeah.
  </li><li>Exactly.
  </li><li>And I don't want them to touch my feet either.
 So yes, I don't want them to touch me.
 We call them finally.
 OK, but I also don't want to spend $40 on my nails
 when I can do them myself.
 But they do break, and I've been doing lots of manual labor
 cleaning, that sort of thing.
 Very funny.
 And so I kept seeing these advertisements
 for being able to do dip, which is just basically like,
 It's like having a really thick, like an acrylic nail
 put on top of your nail that stops it from breaking
 and these don't, they don't chip.
 And so I saw like a home kit for $30 and I thought,
 well, if it's $30 and it's wasted,
 it's only $30 and at least I tried it
 'cause I've been thinking about it.
 So I did my nails yesterday and one hand
 definitely looks better than the other.
 And it's not the hand that you would think.
 So my right hand looks better,
 but I think that's because I did it second
 and I'd sort of gotten down the how to do it.
 And so this one looks like kind of a little bit bubbly,
 but because I can't really see without my glasses on,
 they look fine to me from here.
  </li><li>So you spent $30. - Yeah.
  </li><li>So you didn't spend $40 getting it done professionally.
  </li><li>Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
 but I have-- - Genius.
 (laughs)
 Okay, that's-- - I need to explain
 something else.
  </li><li>I'm not an expert, but my observation
 of women's healthcare and beauty products is that
 you can buy dog food for $30.
 What convinced you that this would be a good product?
  </li><li>I just thought it would be fun for the summer, okay?
 And-- - And was it?
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Because also the colors interesting.
  </li><li>Not as fun as you might think while you're sitting.
 (laughing)
 So I got four or six different colors.
  </li><li>Uh-huh.
  </li><li>So you say, you know, you spent $30 and $40,
 but it's $30 for like being able to do it a whole bunch of times.
 So like it's much, much, much, much, much cheaper just to tell you that because I
 can do it a whole bunch of times, although I don't really know how I take it, how I
 take it off my fingers.
 Um, cause it's like raw card.
 So this stuff isn't your nail.
 My nails underneath it because I don't have fake nails to put underneath it.
 So that's my, but this is like hard stuff on the top.
 Here look, wait, I'll scratch you.
 See, feels different, isn't it?
 (laughs)
 Anyway, yeah, so, but the color of the powder
 changes apparently once you put the activator on it.
 So I thought I was putting on something
 that was sort of like a rose pink
 and that's some pretty cosmic purple right there.
 So, but it's on now and I don't know how to get it off.
  </li><li>When I saw the color, I was like,
 you look like a woman of a certain age.
  </li><li>Who uses-- - Slow down.
  </li><li>Who uses-- - Slow down.
 So-- - I'll laugh out while I go.
  </li><li>Okay, it's a pretty purple and your daughter,
 whose favorite color's purple,
 thinks that I did it for her, so let's leave it at that.
  </li><li>It's pretty, she never listens to this episode.
  </li><li>What do you wanna talk about today?
 You look like you're like--
  </li><li>No, it's just my brain went to,
 what are we talking about today?
 And I was trying to run through my notes,
 but it's easier if I just actually look at my notes
 and see what I'm talking about. - Yeah, that'd be better.
 I'll drink coffee while you look at your notes.
 First time you ever had coffee on the show.
  </li><li>I know, well, I was desperate.
 Today I needed it.
 This was such a crazy week.
  </li><li>All right, we're gonna talk about the importance
 of being able to live in both tension and peace.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Or how to live in peace while tension's around.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Because there is a notion that in order for you
 to live at peace, you can have any tension.
  </li><li>You can't have any tension.
  </li><li>You can have any tension.
  </li><li>Which is just a fallacy because life is filled with tension.
 But seriously, from the seemingly benign, here's a tension.
 I want to eat chocolate.
 I don't want to gain weight.
 Yeah.
 Or I'm really, really married.
 Really, really married?
 I thought that just married.
 I am married.
 You were really, really married.
 But I also want to spend time with my friends.
 Yeah.
 So those are the simple tension.
 What's the number one thing that we canceled brand new couples
 on?
 It's the tension over why is my life changed?
 Because you committed your life to another person
 and you don't have as much free time as you had before.
  </li><li>Right, yeah.
 And it's not all about you anymore.
  </li><li>Right, so there's lots of tension.
 But then you can move up to the philosophical
 or existential tension that we all just lived through
 last year, like I talked about last week.
 You know, oh my gosh, people I love are making choices
 that I can't wrap my hand around
 while they're making those choices.
 Or, oh my God, what is our government doing?
 Or I can't believe the CDC is doing this
 or isn't doing this.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>That's all tension.
  </li><li>There's constant tension.
  </li><li>Tension in relationships.
 there's a tension of finances and bills and planning
 and looking ahead to the future in college funds.
 And I mean, there's always tension.
  </li><li>Life is filled with limitations
 and limitations always introduce tension.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So how do you live at peace while in tension?
  </li><li>It's a great question.
 How do you live in peace while in tension?
  </li><li>Well, let's talk about that because
 let's not answer the question,
 how do you live in peace and intention yet?
 Let's talk about me and you, our ways of dealing with tension.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I mean, you just did a whole podcast episode on two podcasts ago.
  </li><li>I did, yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>But seriously, as humans, we have lots of options available to us.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>A lot of them not very healthy, but like retreat, hide, withdraw, ignore, deny.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Push into fix.
 I was thinking about life languages.
 We've talked about life languages before.
 Life language is so, so helpful.
 Everyone's all about the anneagram.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 languages. Yeah. And so life language is seven different ways that we speak emotionally and
 relationally and we communicate and process life process. You know, we're all we all have varying
 degrees of fluency in all seven. But what's interesting about life languages is it also tells
 you what you're predictably the way you're going to predictably sabotage when you're in crisis or
 intention. Yes. And we're both high shapers. Yes, very high shapers. So the distress flayers for
 the way that we would typically react
 is criticize, eliminate, take over.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>For others, it's attack, demand, attack.
  </li><li>Essentially, we want to control if we can't.
  </li><li>Totally, yeah, absolutely.
 And if you can't get out of the way so that I can.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So I was just thinking about that,
 but you've talked about some of the ways
 that you have managed your attention.
 I think I go to, I'm mainline data,
 certainly in the last year and a half.
  </li><li>Yes, you do.
 Let me research the heck out of everything.
 I mean, let me just snore up all the data.
 Let me assimilate, let me have a plan,
 and then let me argue my way out with it.
 Let me like, oh, the reason you're making bad decisions
 is you don't know this.
 Let me just teach you this, this, and this.
 And of course, that's a gift,
 'cause as a teacher, it's helpful.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It's also not really effective way of living life.
  </li><li>Right, and you can't logic your way out of distress.
  </li><li>Well, especially if your distress is
 in that more existential category,
 Like I was thinking about, you know,
 we're doing the boundaries, summer school at the moment,
 talking about boundaries a lot.
 And I was thinking about the simple aspect of boundaries
 is imagine you've got a hula hoop around you.
 Everything inside your hula hoop is yours to manage.
 Everything outside of your hula hoop is not yours to manage.
 At best, maybe you can influence,
 but largely you have no control over it.
 I've been thinking about most of the stuff
 that my tension has been about
 is all outside of my hula hoop.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>And I'm thinking, oh, if I can just strategize order,
 If I could just ask for a harder, if I could research harder,
 and I'm like, oh, none of it's all outside your room.
 You have no control over that.
  </li><li>Right.
 I think that what's tricky is,
 like I think I have moments where it's healthy boundaries.
 Hey, that's outside of my hula hoop.
 I also have moments where I head into apathy.
  </li><li>So glad you said that, yeah.
  </li><li>So it's like, no, I'm actually like,
 you know what, I don't even care.
  </li><li>Let's hold that thought,
  </li><li>Yeah. - The thin line
 of walking between, it's outside of my hula hoop
 and a healthy response is I can't manage it,
 so I have to trust. - Right.
  </li><li>There's a thin line between that and it's just apathy.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Which is unhealthy.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Well, I'm gonna talk
 about that in a second. - Okay, I didn't know that.
 There you go. - The reason I'm excited
 about how to live in tension is I wanna share with you
 something that the Holy Spirit shared with me.
  </li><li>Oh. - I was having one of those,
 so one of the things I've learned that I do
 in the last year, which to be sure
 I've done my whole life, but didn't know I did it.
 That whole thing of, you know, awareness is so important.
 Is I remember it very clearly.
 I'm driving down Highway 65.
 I'm driving south on Highway 65.
 I forget where I was, but I was north
 and I'm heading south back to our house.
 And what I don't realize I'm doing,
 I realize I'm driving, I'm aware that that's what I was doing.
 What I didn't realize I was doing was I had gone
 into a future imaginary scenario
 And I'm basically in core arguing my position.
 And I'm also arguing the positions of all the people
 who are like figureheads of what my tension is about.
 I'm arguing their side, I'm arguing my side.
 And as I'm doing this, unaware I'm doing it
 'cause I'm driving, I hear the Holy Spirit say to me,
 he says, "Alen, the option to not concern yourself
 with things too wonderful for you is always available."
 And just him saying that snapped me out
 of what I was doing.
 Like, what I'm doing is driving where my,
 all my mental capacity is, is in the future scenario
 where I'm, well, I'll say this and then they'll say that.
 And then I'll say this and I'll say, you know,
 just doing my decision tree of if this, then that.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Else, this, if this, then that, you know, just.
  </li><li>This story terrifies me on a number of levels, actually.
  </li><li>Well, talk to me about your fear.
  </li><li>Well, here's my fear.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You don't pay attention when you're driving
 in the best of times.
 And now you're saying you go and have this conversation.
  </li><li>What I'm saying is I walk with your future self in a court,
 whatever, and in addition to that,
 you said you were driving on 65,
 we don't drive on 65 to go to work,
 which means you're driving on 65 coming back
 from like Uncle Julio's or someplace like that,
 which means my children are probably in the car
 while this is happening.
  </li><li>We all do a certain level of dissociation
 while we're driving.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Like we get home and you know.
  </li><li>But you need to be in the game.
 And still you can't remember driving home.
  </li><li>In my defense, I wasn't aware that I was doing the thing
 of the like, you know, my mental capacity was occupied
 with arguing my case.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Until the Holy Spirit said that.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>Well, 'cause driving's an automatic thing.
  </li><li>I'll try and let it go.
 I'll just try and, yeah. - Yeah, I understand.
  </li><li>I'll put that not into apathy,
 but just outside of my, trusting the Lord.
  </li><li>To keep me safe.
  </li><li>And my children.
  </li><li>And to children.
 The children were in the car.
  </li><li>If I remember.
  </li><li>I was pretty sure they were.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Anyway, I have this, you know, this little Holy Spirit thought
 and I instantly recognize that's Psalm 131.
 I've actually copied and pasted it,
 but I didn't copy and paste the reference.
 I wanna read it to you, right?
  </li><li>Okay, yeah.
  </li><li>So I know that it's Psalm 131.
 And so I go home and I read it.
 And this is what it says.
 It's David, David, who's a man who lived
 in a certain amount of tension?
  </li><li>Oh yeah, you could say that, yeah.
  </li><li>He says, "My heart is not proud.
 "Lord, my eyes are not haughty.
 I do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me, but I've
 calmed and quieted myself.
 I'm like a wing child with its mother, like a wing child I am content.
 Israel, put your hope in the Lord both now and forevermore.
 You know those times when you read scripture, eyes up here, babe, I see you checking me out.
 I can't help it.
 You're so cute.
 Yeah.
 Go ahead.
 Sometimes when you read scripture and scripture just teaches you like the words jump off the page, the Holy Spirit just brings jumps into your spirit.
 Oh, it just brings convictions got this kind of like negative spin to it.
 Conviction is beautiful.
 You know, the Holy Spirit convicts you and helps you understand.
 And in that moment, I just get this download from heaven about the way I've been living, the way I've been thinking and an opportunity to think in a different way from heaven.
 And so actually, I need my notes because there's a thought for each verse.
 I'm ready.
 What's your first thought?
 A Derek Prince used to say, when you read the Bible, the Bible reads you.
 Right.
 He'd talk about, you know, the Word of God is alive, sharper than a two-edged sword.
 Yeah.
 That's what happened.
 Because I'm reading that and I'm thinking, Oh, no, my heart is proud.
 Like David's saying, my heart is not proud.
 And I'm like, Oh, no, my heart is totally proud.
 Right.
 Because I'm having a conversation with a group of people who aren't there to speak
 for themselves. So I've got the arrogance, the pride to think that I know what they're
 thinking, what they're feeling, what they're saying, so that I can present my cases against
 them. Which is never good because we actually never know what the other person is thinking.
 No, one of my favorite Bill Johnson's quotes is precisely that we're our dumbest when
 we think we know the motives of another person's heart. And here I am in this future courtroom
 where I'm, you think this and so here and I'm like, in this moment, I'm realizing, oh,
 And that is so prideful, so arrogant.
  </li><li>But also I think, especially with the people
 that are closest to us, we're the fastest to do that.
 Because we are convinced in and of ourselves,
 I know what you're thinking.
 Like our ongoing joke is like, you'll say,
 well, I know you're thinking this,
 or I'll say I know you're thinking that.
 And we miss each other all the time.
  </li><li>And very briefly we're often wrong.
  </li><li>And we're with each other almost every second of the day.
  </li><li>So think about our news reports and our news channels,
 again to just zoom out a little bit.
 Think how much commentary is based on speculation
 that we take as fact.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>That we, our media,
 attaches narrative and presents it as truth.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Anyway, don't wanna go off on that tangent.
 So I'm having this revelation, I am proud.
 It goes on and says, you know, my eyes are not haughty
 and I'm like, oh no, my eyes are absolutely haughty.
 I had to look up haughty to make sure it was what I thought was.
  </li><li>You are hot.
  </li><li>And shockingly, that's not what it means.
  </li><li>Oh, it isn't okay.
  </li><li>Hottie means superior and disdainful.
 I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 'Cause again, I think I'm right.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Which is horribly arrogant.
 Even if I am right, it's still horrible
 because there's this disdainful attitude
 that like, well, if only you'd done this researcher,
 if only you thought this, then you would know,
 hey, let me teach you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 (grunting)
  </li><li>You know, it's so toxic and horrible and awkward.
 I think I know why I'm right.
 bad enough worse. I think I know where everybody else is wrong. I mean in this
 scenario, right where I'm presenting all these cases, well, if they say this, then
 I will say this and you know, I'm playing this mental chess game with
 everybody. Not only that, I realize that my eyes are darting to and for looking
 for evidence to back up my position. Right. This is just from reading the Bible, by
 the way, like all this is all this is coming out. I'm only two, two, I'm not
 even two verses in. I'm just two parts into a verse and already, I know the root cause
 of my problem. It's that I'm arrogant and proud.
 That's lovely.
 Which I didn't know before. I just thought I was right and people were wrong. And the
 Lord shifted the discussion from right and wrong to are you proud and didn't even entertain
 the other people.
 Well, because I feel like God's discussions with us are all about heart motivation more
 than an intellectual understanding. So it really never is going to be about right and
 wrong. It is always going to be about.
 That's so true because you think about when the Lord has spoken to us about each other.
 Like I remember very early on in our marriage, I'd have a fight and I would go talk to the
 Lord about it. Like I can't believe she's this and that and the next thing and how you're
 all. And the Lord would only ever speak to me about my side of the conversation.
 Yeah. And they would say, well, yeah, well, you were quick tempered. Well, I was, but
 but AJ, the woman that you gave me and the Lord is like, yeah, but I don't hold you accountable
 for AJ's behavior. I hold you accountable for your behavior.
 Yeah. And I was like, well, all right, just as long as you're having a conversation with
 her like that, but from the other side, which he never told me if he was or not.
 Occasionally, you know, occasionally we're talking about other things. And I'm just getting
 go ahead. I'm thinking about that. I'm realizing I hate tension so much that I would rather
 sin than live with the tension. Oh, talk about that. Well, I didn't know I was doing that.
 I just want to, you know, my, I have a core value in life
 that I want to be humble and I want to be meek.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Like that is something I deeply desire.
 And the reason I want it so badly
 is this constant evidence that I don't have it.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Right?
 So it's important to me that I wanna be a humble man.
 I want meekness in my life.
 And now I've got this revelation that,
 oh my God, I am a hottie and I am arrogant.
 And I didn't know it.
 Which means I am more comfortable
 Violing some core values and stepping into sin that I am just sitting with my feelings about tension
 So I will say to make it go away
 Humility is at war with wanting to be right
 Humility was left on you know, I was 65 bleeding and battered and I know it was missing
 Don't worry about it. Oh
 But it gets worse so you keep reading and I realize oh my gosh. I am
 Concerning myself
 With things that are with great matters
 I am concerning myself with things that are too wonderful for me because most of the stuff that I've been
 Intention about is like I said all stuff that is way above my pay grade
 The world's health organization is not knocking at my door going Alan
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>Could you give us your opinion?
 Like, no, it's not in my realm or my sphere
 of responsibility whatsoever.
 And to use a, you know, coin English expression,
 my knickers are in a twist about all of this stuff.
 And I'm finding peace by ramping up my anxiety.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I mean, I'm not finding peace.
 I'm getting away from myself by moving into anxiety.
 I can control rather than sitting with the tension I can.
  </li><li>Right, having lived with you during this season,
 you definitely weren't moving into peace.
  </li><li>Hey, simmer down there.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>I concur.
 Side bar on that topic.
 I was slipping through my journal the other night.
 I was just scrolling through my journal,
 just reviewing the year of,
 winching intercession.
 I come across this.
 I don't often read my journal out loud to the public,
 but I thought this was so pertinent
 to the topic we're talking about.
 I'm flipping through my journal,
 and I come to an entry, and I'm complaining to the Lord.
 This is what I said.
 I said to him, I'm complaining to the Lord,
 which I'm not gonna read out,
 all about the tension and various areas of my life.
 And I'm just pouring out my lament.
 I'm really just kind of whinging in recession.
 And I said this to the Lord.
 I said, Lord, I don't know what to do.
 And this is what he said back to me.
 He said, son, you do know what to do.
 I was like shocked.
 So I was like, I do.
 And he was like, sure you do.
 You need to rest.
 And you need to focus on what brings you joy.
 And you need to trust me that I am in this,
 attention at work for your good. Not to be outdone, I said to the Lord. But Lord, rest feels like
 apathy, trust feels like powerlessness and finding joy in a season of calamity, feel selfish. And so
 the Lord said this, then that is where the problem lies, not that you don't know what to do. It's like
 the problem lies with you, you don't agree with me, right? And you're interpreting what I'm saying,
 You know, and I was just like, oh my gosh, that's absolutely true.
 Like I am so much happier to move to things I think I can manage imaginary courtroom scenarios.
 Right.
 You know, I basically I can I'm more comfortable leaving reality to a future where I win
 than being in the present where I'm left with unanswered questions.
 Yeah.
 Back to Sam 131.
 I'm really I'm reading this and I'm really because my heart is proud, because my eyes are haughty.
 And because I'm concerning myself with great matters and because I'm concerned myself with things that are too wonderful for me, I am neither calm and nor am I quieted.
 Like reading this psalm diagnosed my heart condition.
 And I didn't know any of that was happening.
 Wow.
 Which is what happens when you leave yourself.
 Right.
 Like you depart to a more comfortable place either the future or the denial.
 Yeah.
 I think though, I mean, that makes a lot of sense to me because I think a lot of times I'm
 completely unaware that I've left myself, you know, and it, it
 seems at the time the kindest thing to do, then you have to
 find your way back to that's a bit of a whiplash scenario right
 there.
 Yeah, that's beautiful.
 Yeah.
 So then it's figuring out what is the solution?
 Like, how do we answer it?
 Well, I'm glad you asked because with the solution I found.
 Yeah.
 Was you have to keep reading?
 And then I read the Psalm backwards backwards.
 Well, listen to me.
 So if you keep reading, it says, I'm like a wing child with its mother,
 like a wing child I'm content Israel.
 Put your hope in the Lord, both now and forever more.
 That's the end of the song. Right.
 Now, if you read it backwards, it starts with the instruction to put your hope
 in the Lord, both now and forever more. Oh, that's good.
 So if you read the song, it leads you to the steps.
 If you read it backwards, it tells you how to how to get back.
 Yeah.
 How to get them back.
 Oh, that's so good.
 I have I don't know about this from like a.
 You know, biblical integrity model, but I frequently.
 Did you just belch? That was a well contained belch.
 Thank you. I don't have that skill.
 No, you don't. I just let it out.
 You can't contain any gases.
 No.
 Lucky me. Complete sidebar.
 We have an air purifier in our bedroom
 that is set to automatic.
 And it's on Alan's side of the bed.
 And periodically throughout the night while we're sleeping, it will just ramp up to like,
 it goes to like jet plane running in the room.
 I realize that there's a pattern between when that happens.
 Yes.
 And I'm like, OK, that's very clever.
 Back to the Psalms.
 Back to my, I don't know if this is like an approved exegetical model for reading scripture.
 OK, but like reading Psalms backwards.
 Not that point.
 OK.
 But potentially.
 Yeah.
 But personalization.
 OK.
 So before this Psalm was ever my Psalm, before it was ever written to me, it was written to them.
 Yes. Right. David was writing it and it says Israel,
 put your hope in the Lord, both now and forever more.
 Right.
 Often when I'm reading scripture, I personalize it because yes, it was written an encouragement
 to Israel and I'm not Israel. Right.
 But if we can still take the same scripture that was written then, right,
 to a different time, the scripture still went to us.
 Well, I am a person in covenant relationship with the Lord.
 So I personalize it.
 So I read that as, okay, Alan, put your hope in the Lord,
 both now and forevermore.
 So if you start there working backwards, put your name in and say, put your hope
 in the Lord, both now and forevermore.
 Suddenly your hope, Lord, I'm putting my trust and put my faith.
 Not only that, I'm putting my hope because prior my hope to getting out of the
 tension was to be proved right.
 Right.
 The way out with this tension is if I can just prove to everybody else, they are
 wrong and I'm right. So let's go. Let's lawyer up and do this thing.
 Right. And the Lord's like, "Dad, that's folly." Elsewhere I say, "Don't lean on your
 own understanding." Right. But in all your ways acknowledge God.
 I think what I like about that is it's an action to put your hope in the Lord. And so
 by its very definition is different from apathy. It's not rollover, play dead, don't
 care. It will all work out. Trust God, taste the rush.
  </li><li>Wow. - Right.
 But it's actually, actually,
 no, I am going to recognize the tension
 and in the midst of recognizing, choose to put my hope
 in the Lord. - Do something with my energy.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And then you're actually engaging in trust
 as opposed to apathy.
  </li><li>Well, one of your favorite life
 versus Romans 8.28, which is?
  </li><li>For we know that he causes all things to come together
 for those that love God and are called
 according to his purpose.
  </li><li>Right, so we understand that this tension
 is unto my good. - Yes.
 that this very tension that I'm experiencing,
 that I'm living, that feels crushing,
 that feels suffocating is actually,
 there's goodness in it.
 You can't find it yet, but stay with God
 and you'll have the opportunity to look backwards
 and realize in hindsight, oh God, you're a genius.
  </li><li>And I would say even in that,
 like I have, I can look back at 49 years now of that,
 of God showing up and being present
 and turning things around over and over and over again.
 And even though I have all of that life experience,
 I can still, in a moment of tension,
 forget who he is, the kinds of things,
 what he's like, how kind he is, how faithful he is,
 whatever, and have my freak out.
 And then I have that choice again of trust or apathy.
  </li><li>Well, see my problem, everything you said is absolutely right.
 The danger comes that that choice seems like a cognitive choice.
 But if we've left ourselves,
 we're not at the front of our brain to make that choice.
 We're hiding in Netflix or books or alcohol or porn
 or distress or lawyering up in the future, wherever.
 We've gone to an addictive state
 where the seeming choice is lost.
 Like there's no choice, I have to work my way out with it,
 which is why it's so important to put our hope.
 Like if we start there, I'm gonna put my hope in you
 right now, both now and forever.
 We're now in the season of tension
 and I'm gonna make a commitment
 in the future seasons of tension.
 That's where my all that emotional energy, you know, Gary Morgan says that worry is a misuse of imagination.
 I love that.
 It totally is.
 So think about all the energy I've spent in the last year in the future in an imaginary courtroom where I'm right and everybody else is wrong.
 Right.
 Like all that emotional energy could have been put into imagining all the successful outcomes with God in my life, but I chose not to.
 Then out of that place of securely attaching your hope to the Lord, I find contentment.
 I remember coming back and reading that Psalm and just sitting with the Lord.
 Like there was no sense of God's anger, wrath.
 When we talk about conviction, we think of condemnation.
 Conviction is not condemnation.
 No.
 There's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
 Yeah.
 But conviction is beautiful.
 It's more like a, hey, can I show you what's robbing life?
 And as he's doing that, that contentment comes like, oh, Lord, I forgot.
 Like this is who you are. This is what you're like the contentment the safety and security of having a mom
 Who's gonna look after you like a wing child? Yeah, so you've been breastfed you've experienced all that rich nurture
 For a year a year and a half perhaps you're now eating solid food, which is so good
 But you've got that just think about how secure and safe a wing child feels like I've got this attachment the secure attachment to my mom
 She's still cradling me. She's still feeding me, but now I'm still getting like eye-to-eye contact that she's feeding me and
 I'm hearing her soft voice like open wide here comes a chit chit train. There's contentment the security my needs are being met
 That's the contentment that's available to us. I hope it or hope of the Lord
 Which is beautiful
 See that's safety. I wrote down this and I want to read it because I love the way it's written and I can't
 As I'm reading it
 It doesn't make sense to me.
 And I want to read it without looking at my notes,
 but I'm going to look at my notes.
 Realizing that most people who are listening to the podcast
 don't even know I'm reading notes.
  </li><li>I know, they can't see my nails.
 They don't know your reading notes.
  </li><li>All right, become a member for all that goodness.
 Okay, I've written this.
 Out of that place of contentment,
 of security, of having my hope in God,
 I'm like a wing child with my mother.
 The safety, the security,
 the comfort that I have been missing,
 which leads me to all my figuring,
 all that striving, all that arguing,
 All that mental chess in the future vanishes
 because I'm content with God
 and in time content with mystery.
 Knowing that my God will work all this out for my good.
 And when you're in that place,
 the knowledge that he will
 removes the need to know how.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I can be content, God, I know what you're like.
 Like my experience with you is a lifetime of redemption.
 Like there's no limit to your goodness.
 So I don't need to concern myself with things too wonderful
 for me, like how are you going to redeem this?
 Yeah, how are you, I can just trust that you've got,
 like a ween child doesn't worry about
 where their next meal is coming from.
 Now here's the thing, out of that place,
 like the hope and your trust being put in the right place,
 the contentment that's there of just experiencing
 father, that right there, you would think, that's the answer.
 No, that's not the answer.
 That's the foundation for the answer.
 The answer that common quiet, you know, will come is not automatic.
 It's not a guarantee.
 Look at the words that David says.
 He says this, I have calmed and quieted myself.
 Right.
 So out of contentment, you actually get exercise a discipline.
 Yeah.
 But you also get a platform or the tools or the ability to calm and
 quiet yourself to choose something different than what you were choosing before.
 And that process of calming and quieting yourself is a skill that must be learned, cultivated,
 developed and reinforced. It's not a reflex. It comes by practice. It's something that
 we can do. And I've learned like in seasons of my life, clearly abandoned all my tools
 last year as I went to the back of my brain. Didn't we both?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But what I've learned is that that skill,
 I love what Graham Cook says, it's just a discipline.
 It's like learning to use a laundry, a laundry machine.
 It's like, you know, reminding you
 to have to put the bins out, you know, every Wednesday night.
 It's just a discipline.
 It's just something that you can practice doing.
 And I think what I've learned has been really helpful
 about all that feelings work is the most effective way
 for me to bring myself to calmness and to quietness
 is to feel my feelings, give them to God
 and find out what I need.
 Like what I talked about last week in the episode
 where we're talking about vaccinations.
 Like, you know, I need to feel my feeling of sadness
 to reach the gift of acceptance.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I need to feel my fear
 so that I can reach the wisdom and the faith that I need.
 The danger that I've noticed in my life is that
 when I'm not willing to feel my feelings,
 I leave my body, right?
 Either through all the things we've talked about,
 in this case, this particular case is like,
 oh, going to the future where I have won
 and I'm victorious by reasoning my way out
 with my current tension.
 All right, so we put our trust in God.
 We've got a firm foundation.
 We feel contentment.
 We can practice the skills that we've talked about at length.
  </li><li>Choose peace.
  </li><li>Bringing ourselves calm and bringing ourselves to quietness.
 Out of that place then,
 we realize the temptation to concern ourselves
 with things too wonderful for me.
 The temptation to go there is not worth it.
 like the risk is not worth the reward of what I already have of staying here.
 And I, I've realized that since reading Psalm 131,
 there's now this ability, you don't remember that prayer I talk about.
 It's another Psalm which I should really remember because I quote this a lot,
 but never remember the verse about,
 "May the words of my mouth and meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight.
 Oh Lord, my rock and my redeemer." And I remember praying that,
 I remember praying that years ago when I was a school teacher,
 that the Lord has talked to me about let your gentleness be evident to all.
 And I realized I wasn't very gentle with some of my students.
 So I asked the Lord, Holy Spirit, would you put like a little alarm bell, a trip wire?
 Any time I'm thinking something, anytime I'm going to say something that is not pleasing
 in your sight, would you just nudge me?
 Right.
 Well, I've noticed since, you know, this Psalm 131 that when there's a temptation to leave
 or to reason or to argue or to, you know, go to my mind palace and be the king.
 Now, there's this nudge like, Oh, remember, remember that doesn't lead to the content
 when you're looking for.
 Right.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Great.
 I will not, you know, I now feel like the ability
 to not concern myself with things too wonderful.
 Whereas before it was like,
 oh, that's an automatic reflexes from going to do.
 Did that make sense?
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 I think what I love about that is it makes me think about,
 like one of the things that we teach about,
 like on the school is, you know, or we reference,
 like kind of setting an alarm with the Holy Spirit.
 Like, hey, I've now had this revelation
 that in this situation, I respond like this,
 Holy Spirit, would you set an alarm
 that would, you know, nicely nudge me?
  </li><li>Hey, hey, hey, hey, you're about to head
 in that direction again.
 So I just kind of love that 'cause I think God's so faithful
 that even if we forget that that was an alarm that we set,
 that the Lord is so good to be like,
 hey, hey, uh-oh, that wasn't like--
  </li><li>Hey, we learned a new skill, remember?
  </li><li>Yeah, remember that buddy?
  </li><li>Yeah, I love that.
  </li><li>Well then out of that place of doing that,
 of not choosing to go beyond your hula hoop
 in a healthy way, not in an apathetic way,
 is our eyes are not having a dart to and fro,
 to discern danger.
 We're not having that.
  </li><li>'Cause we have safety already.
  </li><li>Oh, we already have safety.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And of course, you know, everything I've just said
 is like, is great 'cause it's the Bible.
 But it's much easier to talk about than to actually do.
 And part of that is 'cause I have,
 the Lord only knows how long a reflex I've had.
 I'm left myself, I've gone in the future,
 a successful state where I've won World Peace
 by arguing everybody into submission.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>That's been a reflex for so long.
 And now it's that be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
 Oh, that doesn't actually produce life.
 Let's practice this new skill.
 So there you go.
 That's my best thinking, it's not even my thinking.
 That's Psalm 131 with an antidote
 or rules of engagement for living intention,
 which is never gonna go away.
 I mean, it's been ramped up in the last year or so.
 But we're always gonna be in tension
 and we're invited to always be in peace.
  </li><li>Yes, so good.
 I love that.
 too. I love it. I hope that was encouraging to you. Yeah. All right. Mrs. Jones. Yes.
 You shared beautifully and vulnerable to episodes ago. Yes.
 We have a listeners question out of your episode 237.
 Okay. And this is an anonymous person. And she says this,
 the episode about are you dying emotionally wrecked me yet gave me such
 revelation? My question is when you realize what's happening and that you
 Unraveling who do you talk to AJ? Who do you recommend for this type of healing and counseling?
 I'm a single mom and don't have money to pay each week
 I need to find some help as this is overwhelming and of course
 I'm trying to not show this to my kids any help would be appreciated
 I think I have a bunch of thoughts about that for one thing and I didn't do this until way way way late
 But I did talk to one or two friends who are completely outside of the circle of all that I was trying to run from
 and and you know just trusted people that I've known for 20 years that are you know
 People that would have tools that I'm I had just thrown out of the pram in my
 scenario stroller stroller, you know just
 So I did talk to one or two of those people and that did help me quite a bit
 But I also reached out to someone who is a professional counselor and said, "Hey, I
 had this, I don't remember if I said this on the podcast, but I had this realization
 that I was sitting at a meeting with a bunch of people and we're all trying to process
 what we're all trying to carry."
 And in that meeting, several of them were like, "Yeah, you know, but it's okay because
 I'm going to see my counselor tomorrow or I'm going to whatever."
 And I literally thought to myself, what am I doing?
 Like why am I trying to navigate this system or this, this season on my own?
 Right.
 And so much of what we try navigate is like confidential information.
 So it's like, you really can't talk to anybody about it.
 So I reached out to a licensed counselor and just said, you know, I prayed about a lot.
 I have some previous wounding with counseling type things.
 And so I'm not naturally.
 I don't naturally want to do that.
 And so I prayed about it and I had a picture of this person
 who I don't actually know.
 I mean, I know him, but I've never had a conversation
 with him.
 You actually know him.
 And so I just said, hey, babe, I think I need to see someone.
 I need to talk.
 I need to get some better tools.
 I need to process stuff.
 And this is who I thought of.
 And you were like, yeah, he's awesome.
 He's an angel.
  </li><li>I still had a conversation with him.
 You were like, babe, I'm thinking,
 do you have any of you recommend?
  </li><li>Oh, that's right, 'cause I wanna see who you would recommend.
  </li><li>I wanted to see who you would recommend, yeah,
 'cause that's who I was thinking about.
 And so I actually just heard it back from him today.
  </li><li>Yeah, curious timing.
  </li><li>Yeah, and you know, it's taken a couple of months to get in,
 but I'm gonna start doing that, so that's exciting.
 But also like, there's places where,
 like I, anonymous, you said,
 I can't really afford counseling.
 There's places depending on where you live.
 But I know there's places in Nashville
 where they base it on--
  </li><li>They have a sliding scale.
  </li><li>The sliding scale.
 And so, they help you get in there,
 regardless of what your finances look like.
 And I'd be pretty surprised if in most big cities
 there isn't some place that would offer something like that.
  </li><li>That's beautiful.
 I hope that's a helpful anonymous.
 I wanna just add two thoughts.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Is one when you were talking about speaking to,
 you know, trusted friends.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>The, I, anonymous obviously I don't know you
 'cause you're anonymous.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I don't know your setup
 and I don't know your friends.
 The beautiful thing about many of the friends that we have,
 it's not that they're licensed or skilled,
 you know, therapists, professionally trained therapists,
 but they have learned the fine art of creating space
 for other people's feelings.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Where they're like literally holding up a bag
 so that you can vomit into.
  </li><li>Yes.
 what a G and why do you think you're sick and how long it's going to be and right?
 Don't you know better?
 And I've been trying to give you advice.
 Nope.
 They're just creating space for you as a human to be present with all of your feelings.
 They are not threatened by your humanity.
 So if you're going to do that, find people who got a good track record of treating their own heart with kindness.
 Yeah.
 That would be my first thought.
 And then the second thought is exactly what you're saying is, yeah,
 a scaled outside perspective is so helpful.
 And a lot of places do sliding scales,
 but also if you're in a church,
 you will have access to pastors
 and they might not be able to provide ongoing,
 consistent care,
 but they might be able to meet with you once.
  </li><li>Right, or second care.
  </li><li>And they may have resources that you don't know about
 and that are gonna be far more effective
 than just, you know, cold googling it.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So that's another thing that I have found helpful
 in this season, and this,
 what I'm going to suggest is an addition to the two things that AJ's suggested, not an alternate,
 is that sometimes getting your feelings outside of yourself into an external form, either that
 being a journaling, like just pouring out your lament to the Lord, and it just helps you sort out
 your thinking, just like, "Well, and you're feeling like this is what I'm feeling." If you know how
 to journal, when I say know how to journal, I'm talking about two-way journaling, then that might
 I'll put a link in a show on it to an episode where we talk about how to hear God's voice in four easy steps.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But also sometimes if you're in distress with another person, sometimes writing them a letter that you're never going to say.
  </li><li>Yeah, the purpose is not to send it.
  </li><li>The purpose is not to send it.
  </li><li>The purpose is not to send it.
 The purpose is to get all this feelings out on paper because sometimes for me, I don't know what I'm feeling until I talk about it.
 And sometimes there's not people I can talk to, so then I write about it.
 So...
  </li><li>Yes.

 And if you would like to watch the video of these podcasts, if you'd like to get discounts
 on all of our books and our training resources, if you'd like to have priority Q&amp;A, you become
 a member of the show. And to learn how to do that, go to allen and AJ.com/join to learn
 about all the benefits and how to become a member. And I think that's it for this week.
 Babe, I wonder if maybe for next week's show, I should do your nails like dip for the members
 to see maybe we could do green or blue or something something.
 I think that's a terrible idea.
 That's why we're going to wrap up this week's episode. Bye-bye.
