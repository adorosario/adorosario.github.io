<p> Good afternoon.<br/>
 I thought it was gonna be good afternoon hot stuff.
 Well, I just can't, you know, do everything you ask. Otherwise, you'll be spoiled.
 Good afternoon to you. How are you?<br/>
 I'm good. How are you?<br/>
 You know something very good.<br/>
 My neck hurts.<br/>
 Why is your neck hurt?<br/>
 Um, because I looked funny this morning in the shower.
 Well, that's how it arrived.<br/>
 Maybe you never looked funny in the shower. He always looked fine.
 I looked in the wrong direction quickly or something and I pinched it.
 Oh, I'm so sorry.<br/>
 And Ron, since out of town.<br/>
 How dare he?<br/>
 That's right.<br/>
 Well, I'm really sorry.<br/>
 I'll pray for your neck.<br/>
 Jesus.<br/>
 You heal as your neck right now.<br/>
 That's that.<br/>
 How's it feel?<br/>
 It's still kind of stuck.<br/>
 Sorry.<br/>
 Well, I'll practice my 19 later.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 Well, last week we had Jeff dollars a stand in.
 Yes.<br/>
 Did you listen to him?<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 I thought it was hysterical.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 It was really good.<br/>
 We got great feedback.<br/>
 Thank you, everybody who, who emailed us sing.
 And you love Jeff Daller.<br/>
 I think he was a little nervous.<br/>
 I think he, he arrived and was super relieved when he found out it was
 microphones only for some odd reason.<br/>
 He thought it was a video podcast.<br/>
 Did he dress differently?<br/>
 He did.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 He was all dressed up ready to go.<br/>
 You're kidding.<br/>
 No, that's so bad.<br/>
 But Jeff Daller, we love you.<br/>
 He's off to Romania tomorrow.<br/>
 Yeah, for a couple of weeks.<br/>
 I'm how was St. Louis it was awesome. We relieved to come home and find that the kids were not in fact tattooed pierced or
 Their hair is cut their hair was kept. I was
 It was so nice to come home and squish them. I had a great time. They're amazing ladies
 What was your highlight? Give me top two highlights?
 well<br/>
 Haha, number one number two been a whole week, you know
 My mind is just probably one of the highlights would be the
 Professing over the ladies like the team that went this year was just
 Amazing and just really apparently very very accurate and stuff. So the ladies were all sort of going oh my gosh
 It was amazing and my second highlight would have to be that there is the best Thai restaurant in
 Columbia<br/>
 What is it Missouri?<br/>
 Missouri. Yeah, Missouri. Really? Or maybe it's Illinois. Was I an Illinois? I was an Illinois.
 Yeah, it's really good Thai food. We went twice.
 Retreat food? No. I'm the kids survived. Yes. They did survive. You did a wonderful job.
 Say that again, but louder. They did survive. You did a wonderful job.
 Why do you sound like Mark DePond right now, you were to... Well, I just thought you needed
 something extra. We had a fun week. We surprised last minute we're teaching at the school because
 our dear friend Steve Long, who was supposed to be speaking on healing ironically was sick.
 We shouldn't laugh because when this happened to us it's the worst. Everyone
 thought, "Why don't you just heal yourself?" And yeah, he was supposed to be flying in on
 Sunday and on Saturday. He just said, "I've only got the flu or something, but generally
 a week and postponed. So we taught in the prophetic school this week.
 It was really good. Yeah. They were super awesome.
 They were on it. They were really, um, yeah,
 I was surprised how fast they picked it up.
 Tell the story of the one kid who quinton. Yeah. What happened?
 He, um, so we were doing the game where everybody faces forward,
 like they're facing towards me and there's a line of 10 people in that line.
 And, um,<br/>
 they're not allowed to see who comes and stands behind them.
 So you get 10 people stand blind behind them.
 And so, and then I said, you know,<br/>
 ask the Lord for a Bible character<br/>
 that this person is most like,<br/>
 and what about that Bible character?
</p><ul>
  <li>Right.
  </li><li>And so, but they never see who's behind them
 until after they're finished prophesying.
 So I come along with a mic.
 And so, Quentin was like,
 "I keep getting Ruth, but then I keep hearing Rachel.
 "But I think it's Ruth, I'm just prophesying over Ruth,
 "but I keep hearing Rachel.
 "So you prophesy that of Ruth,
 And then that was it, you know, but, but
 because he's got to get he's asking a Lord for Bible
 character.
 It's almost like the person standing behind him,
 right?
 Who he can't see.
 Right.
 So he just begins to describe the life of Rachel and say that
 Ruth.
 Oh, sorry, begins to describe the life of Ruth.
 Yeah.
 And applying that to the person standing behind him.
 Yes.
 OK, I'm with you.
 And then so, but they don't get to see who it is.
 And once we've done the whole line, I went over and stood in front of him to tell
 everybody to turn around and I was like, I'm about to blow your mind.
 So he turns around and the girl that he was processing over was named Rachel.
 So it's just kind of funny because it's like he was getting her name.
 I love that.
 I absolutely love it.
 Yeah.
 Our kids are on fall break.
 They are.
 And they're a little bit excited about that.
 That's an interesting challenge to our week.
 Does it?
 Well, we're not on fall break.
 No, we're not.
 So maybe we'll get the kids to come and teach at the school this week.
 Yeah, what could they teach on?
 Legos.
 We ended up going out this morning to gentry farm if you live in Nashville/Franklin.
 Um, all right.
 In the surrounding area.
 If you haven't been to gentry farms, it's a great place to lose your children for a couple hours.
 Go on.
 Go play in the corn maze.
 We'll see when you come out.
 But it's a working form.
 There's cows, there's.
 Stuff.
 And you wander around anyway.
 The kids love that stuff.
 Don't know stuff.
 Yeah.
 Goats.
 You know, it's crazy.
 It's like it's been my photo library for a tidy up.
 such as the thing I do in my day off.
 And I realized that a year ago today, we were out with my parents at
 gentry for yep.
 So we took some pictures today to recreate those floor shoots a year
 later.
 It's funny because now I'm Jake and Stan did not sit.
 Yeah, he wouldn't sit.
 Do you know what was the moment of glory and hallelujah was for me this week?
 What we finished all 30.
 Hallelujah.
 But you told that our podcast listeners that you wanted to keep going for another 30
 two days. Do you want to update them on that?
 I didn't tell them I was going to. I said, the thought passed through my mind. And like
 all thoughts I took at captain to Christ and beat it.
 Really? Well, so here's the thing. We finished a whole 30 for those of you who are not familiar
 with Whole 30. You commit to eating a very restricted diet for 30 days, which basically has no sugar,
 no butter, no dairy, no fun. And the idea is that detox is your body helps.
 anti-inflammatory.
  </li><li>Helps inflammation go out the throat.
 What else is high in nutrients?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And actually, you know, for all the crazy stuff
 we've done, it's not bad at all.
 It's actually remarkably simple.
 He said, "I haven't finished it."
  </li><li>I've come up with some recipes
 that I would keep making that I think are amazing.
  </li><li>Really tasty.
 It's easy to do eating out.
 We finished it and the idea is that you're not allowed
 to weigh yourself, which is fine and never do.
 Not have to weigh yourself for 30 days
 and you take some measurements.
 What did you lose in 30 days?
  </li><li>Just six pounds.
 Well eight pounds well that's this week we stopped them we've finished Tuesday and I've lost another two pounds since Tuesday well but that's because I'm just pretty much still eating that way right.
 Unlike me who finished and was like where's the ball of root beer.
 No I'm kidding I mean I'm drunk any root beer.
 But you thought about having a lot of love a month twelve pounds on it but I don't think the goal is necessarily weight loss is it no it's to feel better is more you feel better.
 I lost an inch and a half everywhere.
 My chest, my hips, my wassiller, my butt.
 I got my tummy.
 That's right.
 I mean, waste.
 Tummy waste.
 Anyway, I lost an inch and a half.
 You know what I ate?
 My big revelation of all is that sugar makes me grumpy.
 I think I knew that before.
 Right.
 But I don't think I realized what a difference it makes.
 So I was, I wouldn't say grumpy on the whole 30.
 I was frustrated I didn't get to eat sugar.
 And there was quite a bit of whining about that.
 Wasn't whining.
 It was considered into session.
 Oh, OK.
 But what I did notice is when I started eating last couple of days, sugar,
 and I haven't gone overboard, maybe like nine or 10 cookies a day.
 But what I've realized is afterwards, I am just irritable and grumpy, which is
 making me think that maybe I need to do a whole 30 again.
 Because I don't think I go over the sugar hump.
 Despite the fact that I have an autism for 30 days.
 You made paleo cookies to celebrate getting over.
 I did, but I'm sad because they're really flat and they don't look like what they look
 like in the, I mean, they still taste good, but they're like, they don't look like they
 do in the.
 They're delicious.
 They really are.
 They are good.
 What was the thing that you made last night that was anything but delicious?
 Well, it was some sort of chocolate mousse recipe.
 But it was neither chocolatey nor moussey.
 Well, it was chocolatey, but it just had, it tasted kind of grainy.
 tastes like sand because there's flaxseed in it.
 Flaxseed, the choice of all the grapes.
 Of course, I mean, I have six of them left in the fridge.
 So any visitors coming over are going to be given that as their dessert.
 You know what else is awesome?
 That has nothing to do with us other than the fact that's awesome.
 And we know her.
 Danielle, how's and she is awesome and her cultivate boldness career in Atlanta this weekend,
 not content with taking a team of women to New York City a couple of months ago.
 Danielle is in Atlanta this weekend.
 If you haven't visited CultivateBoldness.com, I'd really encourage you to do so.
 It's just this incredible initiative of Danielle just to go and spread the goodness of God
 everywhere through prophetic words, encouraging words, acts of service and physical healing.
 So she basically just takes teams of people everywhere.
 She runs our ministry here at Ammonate called "Fryton Out Lights" where basically people
 go out onto the street, they ask God for words of knowledge and then go find the people
 that they had the words for.
 It's amazing.
 I have to test me.
 So I've been thrilled.
 I've been following her Instagram this weekend and just watching what's happened.
 It's absolutely awesome.
 Very cool.
 Um, this week love, I would love to talk about my, I say this every, it's my favorite topic,
 but I'd like to talk about hit to the deal, which is obviously an acronym for.
 That's a pretty clever one.
 Wow.
 It's so catchy.
 It's, I'm sure it's just stuck in everybody's head.
 to you.
 I heard baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.
 Which stands for how to be utterly awesome in everyday life.
 How to be only awesome.
 You are just content to have jingles.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Our friendship Judd, I remember, and he's just this complete dispenser of wisdom.
 But I remember one day he kind of made this off the cuff remark where he was, I forget
 what we were talking about, whether we're talking about bad behavior by Christians or
 I don't remember, but he just said, you know, surely one of the side effects of the
 anointing of God is that we become nicer people. I know what it was. I think I'd given the
 example of this very, very, I don't know why I said that, very important quote unquote
 Christian author and public speaker that our friend was running the green room for and
 this person finished speaking was very inspirational to sat down and it asked somebody in the green
 room for a bottle of ice cold water. And when given a room temperature of water, he took
 a sip of it and threw it across the room and angrily said, "I want an ice cold water!"
 And so we were talking about the dichotomy of how you can go out on stage and then private
 impact the lives of thousands of people and then in public impact the lives of thousands
 of people, but then in private, be an absolute jerk. And I just don't want to be a jerk.
 And so my definition of awesomeness would probably change, but anyway, it's remarkable
 feats of character that display the attributes of Jesus when no one's looking.
 Would be good definition of awesomeness.
 Give me some examples of awesomeness you've witnessed in other people's lives.
 Well, honestly, I think there's simple awesomeness, like awesome parents, parents that just,
 They're available for their kids, they're patient, they're kind, they manage them when
 they're unmanageable, that kind of stuff.
 I think that's awesome.
 Because I think that nobody else is looking then.
 It's just you and your kids, but you can tell kids that they're being loved and parented
 at home and kids that are not.
 Right.
 And it's very difficult to be consistently brilliant with your kids.
 Oh, it's so hard.
 It is.
 It is.
 amazed when I see parents who not only do it, but have done it for a long period of time.
 And then some of them even keep their own houses clean. It's amazing.
 Yeah, that's a sign and a wonder. That is for sure. Yeah.
 There's this great verse in Jeremiah 9, which is long been a favorite verse of mine.
 In Jeremiah 9 verse 23 says this, this is what the Lord says, "Let none of the wise boast of their
 wisdom, or the strong boast of their strength, or the rich boast of the riches, but let the one who
 boasts boast about this. They have the understanding to know me that I am the Lord who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness on earth. For in these I delight declares the Lord. I love that because what the Lord would deem
 Most worthy is not wisdom, which he loves.
 And it's not strength, which isn't
 impressing him or wealth and riches.
 But this understanding that you can know and know God and know what he's like.
 And I would imagine behave accordingly.
 Yeah.
 Most surely that changes you.
 I remember, you know, Lyle Phillips, who we just think is phenomenal from
 Iris Nashville.
 I remember he was speaking at the more conference and he said this.
 He said, this is about what you may think.
 The last thing people notice about you is your great anointing.
 Learn to be nice.
 There's something wonderful about seeing brilliant people behave meekly.
 Yeah, for sure.
 For sure there is.
 And I mean, we know lots of brilliant people that are meek.
 I think that's what makes them brilliant.
 Yeah, or contribute to their brilliance for sure.
 Because they're, you know, we know as people who are wise and strength and are wealthy.
 the ones that are meek are somehow more exceptional. You know, Michael W. Smith, I think it was in the Holy Ghost movie.
 Remember him saying, you know, we've got two prayers. One is to never ever be offended by anyone else again. I think that's an amazing prayer.
 Yeah.
 I'm amazed at how quickly I can be offended about stupid stuff.
 Yeah. It's really easy.
 Yeah. And I think when that happens, you remove or you withdraw from your awesomeness, anointing.
 Talk to me about some of your heroes and tell me why they, why they, your heroes.
 Gosh.
 Well, like John and Carol would be two of my heroes.
 For many reasons.
 For many, many reasons.
 For many, many reasons.
 When you've seen them be awesome.
 I've seen them be awesome at home and on a stage and I think what makes them the most
 awesome is that they're the same people, no matter whether they're with one person
 or in front of 7,000.
 That's just who they are and they just really are that real and love God and you know they're
 just incredible.
 Is that enough of an explanation?
 Was it enough of an explanation?
 I remember one time being in a church with John and Carol when I traveled with him.
 This was a very famous church for its area.
 I remember the senior pastor loved having John and Carol in, and of course the Holy
 Spirit went everywhere.
 The associate pastor did not like having John and Carol come in.
 Whether it was he didn't like John and Carol's teaching or didn't like the theology or didn't
 like the Holy Spirit messing up his church.
 I have no idea why.
 He was furious and he was livid.
 I remember the senior pastor telling John, I remember over here in the conversation,
 he's not happy.
 John's response was brilliant.
 He was like, "Well, maybe I can take him out for lunch and answer some of his questions."
 John's first response wasn't to rebuke the guy or condemn the guy or shame the guy.
 It was, "Oh, there's clearly some misunderstanding.
 Maybe if I just take him out for lunch, we can sort that out."
 That all was stuck with me.
 the way that John would handle his critics and the way that they're just so gracious.
 I remember another time, I remember the other time we were at a big conference with John
 and one of the intercessors came in and they were freaked out and they told John and Carol,
 "We've just found animal sacrifices around the building, there's sateness in the building
 tonight and there's witches and they've come to curse the service and what do we do?"
 And John's response is like, "That's wonderful!"
 And you could see people like, "Wow, why is it wonderful that witches are here in our meetings?"
 And John was like, "Well, maybe they'll get saved tonight.
 How exciting."
 And again, he never met anger with anger.
 He never met, you know, he'd never respond with frustration.
 I was always amazed at the grace that he would respond with.
 Yeah.
 It was just exceptional in that.
 Yeah.
 Even when people said that stuff that wasn't true about Toronto, it was still really gracious.
 I was also thinking about, I think there's more than once where Carol has been stopped
 coming into the building at a conference by one of the new students who didn't know who
 Carol was because she wasn't wearing her name badge.
 She never got upset or said, "Do you know who I am?"
 She'd either go and find her name badge or somebody would bring her in.
 She was never upset.
 She was like, "They're doing what we've asked them to do and it doesn't matter to me that
 they don't know who I am."
 I mean, I've seen people that all of a sudden this hottiness comes on them like, how dare
 you stop me or, you know, right?
 I don't know.
 I just, I think they're amazing.
 You know, Proverbs 1911 says this, a person's wisdom yields patience.
 It is to one's glory to overlook an offense.
 I'm often amazed how offended I get on behalf of a person who's overlooking an
 offense.
 So Jeff Dollar, for example, I've just seen him constantly overlook legitimate offenses,
 you know, where people have done or said things about him that are completely untrue.
 And yet rather than exerting energy to fix that or defend himself, he'll just extend
 grace.
 And I think that's amazing.
 I'm not sure how.
 How good I am at that.
 I don't know.
 I mean, I don't mean I don't know for you.
 I mean, I don't know for either.
  </li><li>But it's amazing.
 It's an amazing gift to not defend yourself.
 I remember reading about Mike Bickle,
 who again is another one of my heroes,
 just in terms of his character,
 in terms of his commitment to the Lord,
 in terms of his commitment to reflect
 and exercise character that is in line with Jesus.
 I remember when the world was writing about him
 the Kansas City Prophets that he didn't defend himself. He said, "Hey, guys, this is free
 research. First of all, let's just check and see if any of their criticisms are true."
 It's like, "What's our person handled that?" And even when accusations were brought against
 him by people who were at fault, he didn't expose their fault. I think that's remarkable.
 Then there's people who've made just tremendous sacrifice.
 I mean, I can think of tons of missionaries that I'm like, "Gosh."
 I mean, I think, I don't know, maybe this is naive, but I think you have to be built
 a certain way to be able to be a missionary.
 You have to have a certain personality type and be a go-getter and probably not be intimidated
 by much and like the outdoors and that sort of thing.
 But I know lots of missionaries that I'm just in awe of, like, wow, you've given up everything
 to go and do whatever and you actually enjoy it.
 You're not complaining about it.
 It's amazing.
 Absolutely.
 I mean, about a lot of the women in our, in Ammonate, they're all just crazy for Jesus.
 Yeah.
 You know, we've got single women missionaries who are all over the world spreading the
 kingdom.
 I just think it's remarkable.
 It is remarkable.
 You got Rebecca and Uganda running a whole orphanage in a school and feeding how many
 children I've had to do.
 I don't know.
 Thousands.
 You've got Shelly over in Cambodia.
 You've got Tetra over in Mozambique.
 And I'm sure I'm forgetting others.
 But just all these young women who just have decided to just get up and follow Jesus and
 I think it's remarkable.
 Absolutely amazing.
 Tell me some things that you, some character attributes you see in people that you think
 incredible. Sorry, I was mid-yawn. It's so hard to stop in the
 middle. It's contagious. Sorry. Sorry, some character attributes that I
 think are what amazing. You've seen lives of people. Boldness.
 Good. Being able to love well. We know several people that are just
 really good at loving other people, even when other people get ugly or loving is inconvenient.
 I think meekness is amazing.
 Like people display meekness and humility.
 I think that's incredible.
 How about faith?
 People that just believe in the face of adversity, believe in the face of whatever it is.
 They're just hanging on to God for all their worth.
 What about teachableness?
 Yeah.
 That's a hard one, isn't it?
 Most people don't value teachableness.
 Right.
 I think somewhere along the line we think that if you're mature, you no longer need
 to learn anything.
 Right, which is hysterical.
 Which is really a struggle, but some of my most favorite people are people who are constantly
 humbling themselves to learn.
 Okay, again, back to John and Carol, not that, you know, but I mean, how many times
 have we done a weekend or a conference with them or whatever where Carol's like, "Oh,
 I wish we could just sit underneath you guys and learn more about this or that or whatever.
 And I'm just like, what?
 I don't drugs.
 But I think it's because they are so teachable.
 They're so pliable to the Holy Spirit and they're so hungry for all things God that they
 don't act like they've arrived anywhere.
 There's something about good manners too.
 I think it was John Sanford that said, "Curtise is the hallmark of the kingdom of heaven,"
 which I thought was really interesting phrase.
 but sincere good manners are amazing. Our friend Rogers, whenever we'd go see him,
 I noticed after a while he would always, whenever I'd be with him, whether a restaurant or his house
 or at go see him in his office, when I would say goodbye, he would always walk me to his
 off the property, he'd always walk me to my car. One day I commented on that and he just smiled
 and he said, "You know, I had a mentor who would always do that and I always realized he did it."
 and I remembered how amazing it made me feel.
 So I thought, I'm going to start doing it for other people.
 Yeah, their whole family, if you're at their house,
 walks you out in waves and like you're the king of something.
 I was going to say the king of Sheba, but that's not how it works.
 No, no, it doesn't.
 John Paul Jackson said this,
 "Rudeness is the weak man's form of strength."
 "Rudeness is the weak man's form of strength."
 That's a defense mechanism, isn't it?
 To quote Lyle again, he said, and he was quoting somebody called to swore Gary.
 I don't know who that is, but anyway, Lyle quoting that person said, "This good
 manners without sincerity are like a beautiful dead lady."
 Oh, God.
 Quite the image there.
 Very nice.
 Bill Johnson.
 Yes.
 I mean, Bill is just awesome.
 Just in terms of his wisdom, in terms of his walk with the Lord, in terms of, you
 You know, all the people I know who know him really well, I've never ever heard anything
 critical about Bill.
 Yeah, me neither.
 I just think that in itself is test-oriented.
 But I love his tweets.
 I mean, he's got some just amazing wisdom.
 I favor it this one.
 He said, "We are our dumbest when we think we know the motives of another."
 Right.
 Oh, my gosh.
 Isn't that so true?
 We're absolutely convinced we know the motives of other people.
 They did this because of that.
 Yeah, and then you're just like, "You don't know that."
 So when you watch people pause and not walk in that, that's awesome, I think.
 Yeah.
 Choose to believe the best about other people.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 That's exhausting.
 We wrote an article a while back where we had a teaching where we noticed four things that
 were consistently present in the lives of awesome people.
 And in order, I mean, no particular order.
 The first one was humility.
 Yeah.
 People who were humble, absolutely contributed to their awesomeness factor.
 People who are patient and in their patients therefore were persistent and not dissuaded
 was amazing.
 People who are hard workers, there's something glorious about hard work.
 There is, you feel like you've accomplished something.
 I love it.
 I absolutely love working hard.
 I really, really derive great satisfaction from that.
 But again, all the people I know who are awesome, they have that.
 Work ethic.
 They have an amazing work ethic and they work hard.
 Yeah.
 You know who two of my most amazing people that I know are is,
 and you know them better than I do, but Kristin, Jason Wendell.
 Yeah, I was thinking about them earlier.
 They're amazing.
 Yeah, they're fantastic.
 People who don't know Kristin, Jason, describe them.
 They're attributes and who they are and what they do.
 Oh, this is tricky.
 Well, Krista is a bottle of life, basically.
 She is very intelligent, very prophetic, very kind, extremely loving.
 Like she's just, Jason got the package deal.
 But she's also in the midst of all of that, she's super healed up.
 She is super healed up.
 Yeah.
 I would say she's probably a first language responder.
 I'm not sure I'd have to check with her.
 But yeah, really healed up.
 But she's this ever-vesant source of joy and encouragement and optimism.
 but because of her healed up and none of those things are a brace of her annoying right so what
 i mean with that is if you're you know let's face facts when we're around super positive people
 sometimes they can be annoying yes right sometimes but her super positivity is not naivety it's
 complete confidence in the goodness of god yeah and so rather than it wearing you down or condemning
 you because you're not as uber positive as this person it lifts you up yeah and then Jason is
 is like probably the smartest person I know.
  </li><li>I would say so.
  </li><li>So incredibly smart, incredibly dedicated,
 but again, in his smartness and his intelligence,
 he again pulls you up, never makes you feel demeaned
 or stupid or he doesn't boast in his accomplishments
 and he has a ton of accomplishments.
  </li><li>Yeah, and on top of that, they're great parents.
  </li><li>On top of that, they're both exceptionally good-
  </li><li>Yes, they are.
  </li><li>Like what the heck is with that?
  </li><li>I know, that's not-
  </li><li>Share the wealth, Jesus.
 It's like just deposit.
 I'll just make you really smart and hard working and likable and tons of
 favor and out to top off and make you super good looking.
 I think even to how they've navigated living in night, Robie and, you know,
 all of the fighting that's been going on, you know, gunshots outside their door
 and all that kind of stuff and they're still choosing to stay where God's put
 them. And, you know, they're just, they really are amazing.
 But dear Lord, we are surrounded by awesome people.
 Yes, we are.
 I mean, literally we could just run down the roll decks of people that we love.
 And you could just point out all the things that are awesome.
 Everybody is awesome.
 I think it's amazing.
 I don't know the words.
 That is never any reason for you to stop trying, darling.
 I'm trying to see if there's anything else I scribbled down that I thought about.
 What about Ben? He's awesome.
 Ben Farley.
 Yes.
 I don't know a person who is more enduring in their pursuit and presence of joy than Ben
 Farley.
 Amazing.
 So we have a dear friend, many of you will know Ben, but he has the, I think this is
 right, the rarest form of cancer in America.
 And I remember the day I met him, I met him at Grace Center on Sunday morning, one Sunday
 morning.
 in the prayer line and he came up and said, "Well, you need prayer for it."
 So he told me I had cancer.
 And then we got an up end for a bunch of years.
 He came and it was a student at the school of supernatural life and then came back as a small group leader and was on staff with us.
 And he was a riot.
 It's a riot.
 It's a whole riot.
 You would never have known he had cancer at all.
 Yeah.
 Ben shows up in a room and the party has arrived.
 That's right.
 It's a party in a package.
 So just even watching Ben persevere with cancer and watching him, even this week when we went
 to see him, the nurses were just like, "One of the nurses said, 'I wish my son had faith like you.'"
 And so Ben grabs the nurses hand and is just like, "Well, let's pray for your son right now."
 And that's what Ben's like. He's just constantly extending love and
 efforting the goodness of God for other people.
 Yeah.
 Ben's amazing.
 Yeah.
 And even being in the hospice, he's managing the keep his, you know,
 he was cracking some jokes when we were there a couple of days ago, whatever.
 We're like, just, I don't know anybody like him.
 No, amazing.
