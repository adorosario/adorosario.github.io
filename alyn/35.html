<p> Hey sexy.<br/>
 Not a good start.<br/>
 It solves a great way to start.<br/>
 Are you kidding me?<br/>
 How are you all stuff?<br/>
 I'm good.<br/>
 Are you good because we've been mad for ten years?
 Ten years.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 That's one of the reasons I'm good.<br/>
 You're an assistant in introducing jingles to our podcast.
 Well, you just want to mix it up a little bit.
 You know there's actually a podcast app I could give you that is like a soundboard for radio
 DJs where you could introduce randomly like sound effects.
 Let's do that.<br/>
 Let's never.<br/>
 No, I'd be so good at that for sure.<br/>
 Okay, before we talk about our 10-year wedding anniversary, let's talk about this week.
 That just happened.<br/>
 It was a wonderful week.<br/>
 It kicked off with the bearded wonder that is Lyle Phillips and his stunningly gorgeous
 pregnant wife, Allison.<br/>
 It's true.<br/>
 If you don't know who Lyle and Allison Phillips are, they are the pastors of Iris Nashville
 here in Nashville.<br/>
 which would be what it's called Irish and not Irish not Phil.
 Not Irish.<br/>
 Irish.<br/>
 I thought Irish.<br/>
 I think I said Irish.<br/>
 Anyway, Lyle and Alice are dear friends of ours and we love them at pieces and Lyle was
 in teaching at school this week on missions and life and changing the world.
 What was the quote that he came up with that I just thought was fantastic.
 There were several of them actually.<br/>
 One of the loud brilliant quotes from the week was, "Anything short of world change
 has compromised."<br/>
 That pretty much sums up Lyle Phillips.
 That's Lyle, yeah.<br/>
 There you go.<br/>
 Saying the bar nice and low for the rest of us.
 That was cool.<br/>
 He spoke at Emmonate Monday night as well, which was fun.
 Back at school Tuesday night.<br/>
 I see my number two tonight, we just came home collapsed.
 I think Tuesday night, I was trash.<br/>
 Well, you stayed up late, which makes sense now that I know what was happening on the
 weekend.<br/>
 but i think i was in bed by like eight thirty i was so tired exhausted yeah
 yep and then wednesday was work as normal day full of meetings yada yada but at night we were
 going with our dear friends mason and amily who we haven't seen in a while which was amazing
 and we went to moto moto moto newish atalian restaurant and god bless mason and amily they didn't
 know it was our wedding anniversary the following day, but they treated it if they didn't know
 that and we had an amazing time with that. What did you end up eating?
 I had the fillet because anytime I can have steak, I'm going to eat it.
 That's right. But I shockingly had Brussels sprouts and liked them.
 So you need to understand that me and Brussels sprouts have had a hate-hate relationship for
 over forty years now you've previously described them as the devil's vegetable.
 Little bitter cabbages horrible little things but Mason ordered them with his food.
 I had no intention of even smelling them, let alone taste in them, but everybody was talking about how good they were.
 I thought, oh, well, I'll try one just to prove that there's no such thing as a good Brussels sprout right and shockingly.
 It was really good. So I actually had more and then I considered two days later trying Brussels sprouts again
 Just based on how good motos Brussels sprouts were. It's like half a new wife
 Well, it's amazing and I remember alson hendrichson saying no if you have them like done really well
 You'd really like them and I was like no I absolutely would not ever like them ever
 Have you heard patterns of that? No, I probably need to I probably need to texture and say I repent
 you were right about Brussels sprouts and then Thursday was a fun day for me because
 as far as you were aware Thursday was our actual 10 year wedding anniversary that's right 10 years
 people 10 years which while we don't want to make too big a deal of that because there's plenty
 of people listening to this would be mad way longer than that it's actually a big deal yeah i can't
 think i've been doing also been doing for 10 years um like takes about the same uh it takes
 What eight years for PhD?<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 So we have we're way past the PhD in marriage.
 We have PhDs in marriage.<br/>
 Doctor marriage.<br/>
 What did I work out?<br/>
 The marriage doctor.<br/>
 Who is it the rule that book that said you need 10,000 hours of
 practice and something to be considered an expert?
 I worked out that give or take a couple of hours because of times
 on differences.<br/>
 We've been married for 87,720 hours.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 So we're eight times an expert.<br/>
 We're reasonably good at it.<br/>
 Yeah. Well, some of the reasons we go to marriage, we have been married for 10 years and still like each other, love each other and enjoy being married.
 I'm not sure we get to count the hours where we're sleeping. So we probably need to drop a third.
 Is that smart? Okay. Well, still, you know, we're still well over the 10,000 hours.
 Yes, it's true. Yeah. Although I don't know, sleeping together. Never mind.
 I meant actually sleeping. Oh, dear. I thought we could veer into that self-ecomensation, but apparently when we're first,
 We're coming out of that coldest act on budget.
 Well, Thursday was a fun day for me because we do Dave Ramsey.
 So we live by a very strict budget.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 AJ is well aware of.<br/>
 And so she's seen our finances, seen our budget.
 So I think the best you were hoping for, we've been given that's what it was in the natural for real.
 We've been given a gift certificate to go eat a Ruth Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.
 The story that I was feeding you was, well, you know,
 we have made it through Christmas and you know January we're tightening our
 budget wise and so well at least we get to go a Ruth Chris Steakhouse and that's
 time to look forward to and I'm feeding you that line because I'm trying to
 surprise you which is very difficult to do because A) you're very pathetic and B)
 you've been married to me for 10 years so you can tell when I'm up to
 something and as I listened to the podcast realized that last week you said
 It kind of feels like you're doing something as a smoke stream and I was like, "Dang it,
 Lord, please, blind her.<br/>
 You're a drinker."<br/>
 Well, I did know, obviously, we're trying to get that free before we do anything crazy.
 So in the back of my head, I'm like, we're not going to get to go away anywhere and I
 just need to be happy with, we'll get some time together and have a nice dinner.
 And one day, we'll get to do those fun things.
 And then, I'm going to announce to you, I had, behind the scenes of range to take Thursday
 off to go off on an adventure, which we'll talk about in a second.
 And so the actual, the only two, the only five people who knew what we were up to was
 Jeff and McLaurin.<br/>
 So Jeff being my boss and our senior pastor at the Grace Center, McLaurin, who's our HR
 person, had declared getting the days off there.
 And they were in on it too, because on our Thursdays, we usually have a meeting, the
 four of us always meet together and we were scheduled to meet that Thursday.
 I said, guys, can you just keep up the charade that we're actually meeting?
 So I course them to lie.<br/>
 Gosh, I didn't repent.<br/>
 Wow.<br/>
 And the other people who knew were our fabulous babysitters, who without them,
 we could don't hear this weekend.<br/>
 So Cindy and Sarah and Ryan and Katie all knew about it.
 That's six people.<br/>
 OK, depends how you count, though.<br/>
 So who didn't count?<br/>
 And I didn't care.<br/>
 Oh, they're one.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I'm more of a reminded the new world.<br/>
 Oh, I understand.<br/>
 It's King of math.<br/>
 So I didn't even and it's not that I decided not to tell me for colleagues.
 It's just I didn't want the stress.<br/>
 I was under so much stress trying to pull this thing off anyway.
 I didn't want the stress of who I had told and who I hadn't told.
 And then I wouldn't be in control of who I had told and who they had told.
 So I just decided to tell nobody.<br/>
 But as far as you were concerned, when you woke up on Thursday, was we were having a normal day.
 Well, on Wednesday at the senior team meeting, we had covered off stuff that we would have
 covered off at the school senior team meeting.
 So I was sort of like, yay, since we got that covered off, maybe because Cindy was already
 coming over at 11, we could go to Pinewood Social for the day.
 And we could actually have almost a whole day together, which to me was like, that's amazing.
 We've done that once before.<br/>
 Because your love languages are quality time and gifts, which are my last two.
 Yes. So my anxiety is planning something for you that I'm not good at speaking and hoping it works out well.
 Well, and you did an amazing job of course, but... But I didn't know that at the time.
 Right. So talk about Thursday, we got the kids on the bus, it's a normal day. I turned to you and say, "Do you have a card for me?"
 That's right. Yeah, you turned to me and say, "Do you have a card for me?" Which, funnily enough, I had bought a card the week before for Holly's birthday and then misplaced it.
 So I did have one somewhere.<br/>
 So I said yes.<br/>
 So you bought time.<br/>
 But I bought another one.<br/>
 Yeah, so you turned to me and say to a card for me and I say yes I do, but I'm giving
 it to you later because I needed to find it.
 And but I didn't say that part.<br/>
 And then you said, well, I have two cards for you and you held up two cards and you
 said now and it said on each of the cards, one of them said something and the other one
 said everything.<br/>
 Now I want to know if you want to know something about what's happening today or everything about what's happening today
 So it was like well, duh. I'm a 90 something percent shaper. I want to know everything. So I opened it
 And there was very nice words about how you love me and then ps I knew you would pick this one
 Then I opened up the paper and it was like
 We're going away for three days. You're gonna need walking shoes. You're gonna need
 fancy clothes for this, you're going to need casual clothes, you'll need your bathing suit,
 whatever. I just burst into tears. I couldn't read anymore. I was just, I was an absolute shock.
 And of course, I'm like, "These are good tears?" Because the thing is, like, I had been thinking
 since the fall, I just want to get away for a few days. We've never, ever done it. Since we've had
 We've never gotten away just the two of us and chilled out.
 Not even for a whole day.<br/>
 I mean, my memory is not the best, so I trust you.
 We haven't.<br/>
 Oh, I'm not arguing that.<br/>
 I'm just skeptical of that's true.<br/>
 Is that the same as arguing?<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 I'm telling you, it's absolutely true.
 Okay, I will retire my case.<br/>
 Overall.<br/>
 I would know because I'm the quality time person.
 So I was just, you know, I was hoping for that in the fall,
 but then just realizing that's not what it's going to look like for us right now.
 So I had sort of killed that in my heart, even knowing that, okay, we're,
 we're staying here and we're going to, we're at least going to go get coffee
 and get most of it a together and go to Ruth, Chris, and I'm going to be happy
 with that and I'm thrilled.<br/>
 So when I opened that, it was like God said, I'll see you're thrilled and I'll raise
 you exactly what you wanted to do.<br/>
 which is really funny for me because of my inability to gauge what counts as quality that like a reminder pants and i'm watching dv why join me voila.
 What do you do i want to play mariacar quality time hey we work together we drive to work on the way there and on the way back when you mean you want quality that because of my inability to gauge what quality time actually counts.
 How so nervous about doing something and because at the moment most of our net worth or most of our net worth walls.
 Do you have a network with tight up in air miles yes so.
 We are on a seat for me i got through christmas and survived christmas mentally i mean and then i realize our 10 year wedding anniversary in like 12 13 days.
 So I called my friend Mike who is a bit of a genius when it comes to logistics and I just
 called him and said, "Mike, I need some help. I have about 100,000 air miles." And that's it.
 In terms of spending money, I just don't... We have budget, and it doesn't exist. So I've got
 to use air miles. What can we do? And so he's just a genius. He's like, "Well, do you want to fly
 someone?" I'm like, "No." We don't have enough time. He said, "So you're going to drive. Do you
 Do you want to drive less than five hours or over five hours?
 I'm like less than five hours.<br/>
 So he just like a machine is like, if you go five hours north, it's here.
 If you go five hours east, well, you've got this five hours south.
 Of course you could go here five hours west.
 So I'm trying to think, what is AJ like?
 What is AJ like?<br/>
 AJ likes, she likes outdoors and she likes history.
 So I'm thinking, what is, what is her history?
 Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.<br/>
 And I remember this place called, what is the place I was getting confused with
 the Gettysburg Address?<br/>
 Gatlinburg Gatlinburg, the Gatlinburg address, and the Gatlinburg address.
 I always get confused.<br/>
 I knew there was something near Gatlinburg that was of historical significance.
 Well done, darling.<br/>
 Then I realized that where we actually went is nowhere near Gatlinburg.
 Well, it's kind of nearer than here.<br/>
 This is the way my brain works.<br/>
 But was built more a house?<br/>
 house the bill more state the bill more state and i was just there yesterday i
 still can remember<br/>
 so we can look at that and thought all age would love this an old house that
 you spend the whole day walking around
 i mean i'm gonna hate it but she's gonna love it and so we can't all about
 minutes from to her so let's book it so we booked it and honestly i didn't
 know if you would like it i just thought
 i love anything like that touring old castles i mean that's like
 Sandy that was my childhood though so i think because my mother and father dragged me all around you looking old Roman burial grounds and amphitheaters and castles and
 you know just something i grew to hate and loath where i should have probably been a little more appreciative for the culture they're trying to still meet i'm so sorry completely wasted on me.
 And so i think i might be one old house you've seen all the old houses.
 And I forget that you actually like that.
 I think I find it hard to understand why somebody would like that.
 So then I did find it hard because truth be told I had an amazing time this weekend,
 but I digress.<br/>
 So anyway, I'm all anxious.<br/>
 I'm seeing you crying and I'm thinking, okay, these are good tears.
 The other problem was I gave you an hour and a half notice to pack for three days.
 Yes, which caused some problems later on because I was, I was in so much shock.
 I couldn't think straight and you had planned out all the babysitters, all the meals.
 You've done a different schedule for each day when each meal was, when each bottle was,
 what food was available, all that kind of stuff.
 And so you're like, just read this over, make sure it's okay.
 I remember reading it.<br/>
 I didn't change anything on it.<br/>
 I'm hoping it was okay because I don't remember anything.
 I was just totally in shock.<br/>
 And then I was like, oh, I've got a pack.
 And I was so befuddled that I packed pants that haven't fit me in like five years that
 I'm keeping because I want to wear them again when they do fit.
 Nice.<br/>
 And i forgot to and you had said anything you know close for two nice dinners i didn't remember to bring any nice shirts blouses like it's amazing i mean i basically showed up with underwear and pajamas.
 What should be fine.<br/>
 But i should work like well because we got a hotel you ran out and bought three new shirts i did well that we were the hotel was in like a.
 mall kind of thing and so there was a lot and then there was this other store camera what it's called but looks a lot like anthropology but it's a Christian owned store.
 And they had 60% off of sale items so i got to six dollar shirts and one twelve dollar shirt.
 And it was perfect just busting right open the bank you should be like the gas is an all time low price because i can wear gas but.
 I know it's like $35 to fill the van, wasn't it?
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah, it was crazy.
  </li><li>So anyway, we went away, we had a great time.
 We went to build more, I knew nothing about the built more state,
 but basically it's this massive house
 that was built by George Vanderbilt.
 And I spent a lot of the time,
 almost in tears wandering around his house.
  </li><li>Well, talk about even driving onto the property.
 I mean, you drive onto the property
 And before you're driving for like 10 minutes before you get to the house.
 Yeah.
 I mean, it's miles and like square miles, I can't, you know, I can't even fathom how much of a.
 And he built this house primarily for retreats to, to basically for his, for his friends and for his family to come away and retreat and get away from the business of life.
 And just when you think about this man's intentionality and this man's in.
 Ingenuity.
 Ingenuity.
 That was the word.
 When you think of those two things, it was just staggering.
 At a time when, for example, electricity wasn't common,
 that standard hadn't been settled on AC or DC.
 So he just wired his house with both.
 And to begin with, before Asheville had actual electricity,
 he ran a gas generator to power his own electricity
 in this massive house for several years
 until Asheville provided AC power.
 But he had wired it DC or something, right?
 Well, he'd write it both, but he preferred DC.
 He preferred DC, so he just built a converter.
 Because he was friends with Edison and Edison
 for DC or something.
 I mean, you just learn all this wild stuff
 where you're like, wow.
 So anyway, it was a weekend away of just,
 it's amazing what happens when you're not with your kids.
 The mental energy that's required
 to field questions repeatedly.
 Yes, it was peaceful inside of my own brain.
 Because we'd been doing that for seven years,
 you forget what it's like to not have to do that.
 Yeah.
 Or plan their lunches or have a bag packed with everything for every eventuality.
 Oh my gosh.
 Amazing.
 We just got dressed and left in the morning.
 Yeah.
 It's radical.
 It's just wild.
 And that would not be impossible without our dear friends Sarah and Cindy and Ryan and
 Katie.
 Thank you so much for doing that.
 Thank you.
 You guys were just amazing.
 So yeah, I just love that.
 So anyway, we went away for three days.
 We Instagrammed.
 We probably blew up everyone's Instagram feeds with stuff they didn't care about food.
 Mm hmm.
 Sky, old stuff, buildings.
 We stopped and have been been bad on the way.
 B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B
 Bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim bim b
 That's always a good sign.
 There was liberal use of duct tape as a replacement for proper plumbing.
 I mean, it was just horrendous, but the food was amazing.
 It was amazing.
 But bim bibabap or however you pronounce it is basically rice vegetables and some Korean meat.
 Meat and eggs served in us.
 And then egg on top and you just come.
 Heated stone ball.
 And you mix it all up and add sriracha.
 And so AJ posted a picture and we love it.
 We haven't had a good Korean Bim Bim for a while.
 However, you pronounce it.
 So I posted online and my mother was like, this is what Alan bought you for your
 wedding. This is your 10th wedding anniversary, you were like, no, no, don't panic.
 No, you raised me better than that.
 I did not take it to this two bit Korean restaurant.
 They wouldn't likely fail every health inspection.
 Look, baby, it's under $5.
 OK, you can have this and a starter and then we're done.
 But yeah, so anyway, we were sitting down for dinner and I, I, we were trying not to work, but it was a natural part of our conversation.
 And we thought about our 10 year high points would be married for 10 years. What were some of the high points of what have been some of the high points of being married for 10 years, go.
 Wow. Well, some of the high points, lots of travel was definitely a high point.
 Well, the first one you said I hadn't even thought of, but having kids was a high point.
 Yeah. AbbT and MJ.
 Yeah, of course.
 Those are my three highest points.
 Maybe not the actual moment that I pushed them out because those were sort of mixed with
 it.
 Ow!
 But like having them, great.
 Yes, the fact that they're alive is great and healthy.
 Of course, high point.
 Different times where gods paid off debts have been high points.
 Yeah, watching God come through a few miraculous ways is amazing.
 Go back to travel.
 I still couldn't believe our life that our life literally was an airport.
 It felt like at least every week we were in a different airport.
 Yeah, different countries.
 And around the world, different countries.
 That was remarkable.
 It really was amazing.
 And meeting so many amazing people that, like when you think about it,
 the opportunity we had to meet people that we're going to spend eternity with was quite wild.
 You published a book.
 That's a major achievement.
 I did publish a book, yes.
 Getting a green card was a high point for me.
 Yeah, my love of this nation.
 Amazing.
 Yeah.
 Uh, buying a house.
 Oh my gosh.
 That was our first house.
 That was a miracle.
 Yeah.
 That was not only a high point, but
 miraculous.
 Well, most of these things really are quite
 miraculous.
 You know, one of the high points, which I
 don't think I've ever talked about in the
 podcast was Alberto and Kimberly Rivera.
 Hopefully, you know who they are.
 If you don't stop what you're doing, just stop
 listening, just go straight to iTunes.
 Right now.
 Just right now.
 Doesn't matter which one they're all going to.
 amazing soaking prophetic music people. And when we lived in Toronto, that's, you know,
 Laura Woodley and Alberta and Kimberly Rivera was pretty much all I listened to soaking wise.
 And I had no clue they lived in Franklin much less that they went to Grey Center.
 And so I remember one night they were leading worship. And in the middle of leading worship,
 they called me up and they gave me a prophetic word. And I, that would easily be on the horizon
 of one of my highest points in the last 10 years because here's people who, unknowing to them,
 have been essential to my walk with the Lord for the previous X number of years.
 My most intimate times in soaking with Jesus and being with the Lord, they're the conduit for
 the anointing, their songs, their music, their voice. And so it was as impactful, receiving the
 the prophetic word from them from them in the way they do it, which was singing over you as the
 prophetic word that they gave me. Yeah. And I just remember thinking, God, you're just
 outrageously kind like that. This is absurd. And so anyway, that was a personal high point for me.
 Um, launching a school of ministry. Gosh, amazing. And now launching year two. Come on.
 So much fun. You know, one of our favorite things the last 10 years that we were talking about was
 watching other people succeed, watching the success of our friends, watching our friends have kids,
 you know, especially when you're a few years down the road and having kids and you can really
 appreciate the joy of what you know, what they're stepping into. Yeah. Never having a lie in for 18
 years. I rebuke that. Yeah, that's a damn, but I'll cut that out. Being called out as a profit for
 for me was probably a real high point.
  </li><li>You think?
  </li><li>You think?
 Both a high point and like a scary high point
 if that makes sense.
 Yeah, for sure.
  </li><li>So we did the weekend.
 We talked all about this.
 We got to reminisce, oh, we didn't talk about our bath.
 In our hotel room, we had an infinity bathtub,
 which I'd never heard of such a thing.
  </li><li>Very true.
  </li><li>But it was what, seven feet long?
  </li><li>At least, yeah.
  </li><li>Comfortably fit.
 two of us.
 And the idea was you fill it up and overflowing.
 So it sits, it's a bathtub inside another bathtub basically.
 And so the idea is you fill the bath up as high as you can go.
 And as the bath spills over into the second bathtub, there's pumps that pump it back
 in.
 So you continually have an overflowing.
 Yeah.
 And it's super deep.
 So you can have water up to your chin and actually be like, you know, covered over as
 as opposed to like water to the middle of your rib cage
 because the little stupid drain thing keeps stealing
 on your water.
  </li><li>You know, in that Korean restaurant,
 I bet you if you called their friends,
 they'd just duct tape that stupid little thing.
  </li><li>That's a good thought, baby.
 We'll try that tonight.
  </li><li>You think so?
 Yeah, that was awesome.
 I feel like we jumped round a little bit there.
 I'm sorry.
 Okay, so love languages.
 I'm so nervous about your trip,
 that you're not liking your trip.
 Oh my gosh.
 But I also know that you have another passion in life,
 which is cooking, obviously.
 It is cooking.
 And so we had enough air miles left over
 for me to buy you a La Cruze pot.
 Yes.
 Which your cousin Holly was, is there, you got that.
 She left on Facebook.
 She's like, you are all excited.
 Like, look what Alan got from my anniversary.
 She said, nothing says I love you quite like a pot.
 (laughing)
 It's an amazing pot, Holly.
 Yeah, well, I felt that there's something
 that doesn't do French cooking.
 who does not know what the crazy part is, but I thought that was very, very funny.
 Most people do.
 Yeah.
 You have to have them over for something cooked in the look.
 They are a Caribbean cruise.
 You got your wife apart, but
 I didn't I didn't bank on how much that would touch your heart.
 Yeah, that was amazing.
 I mean, I I just spent the whole weekend, I think, shocked because I don't think
 really until we got to Ashville and checked in
 that I felt like this is real.
 We're actually got away for two and a half days.
 It's just us.
 And we're going someplace that I want to go and see.
 Do we even talk about the Butler's tour and stuff?
 No, go talk about the Butler's tour.
 There's a regular tour that you can do that's part of your admission and it's free.
 And Alan cleverly told us to bring headphones so we didn't have to hold up anything to
 our faces in flu season and germs get on us.
 So we brought headphones and so we just plugged it in and could listen through our own headphones
 as we went through the house and learned the different bits of history and stuff.
 Much to the end we have everybody else's.
 I know most people.
 And the devices to their face.
 Most Philip saw us were like, "Oh, I wish I thought of that."
 So we did that but then we also went and did the Butler's tour which takes you behind
 the scenes so you see like where the head house mistress would have lived and we went
 through the Butler's pantry, which was amazing.
 And saw two old elevators that have been operating
 for over 100 years, paid by Otis.
 Just amazing stuff.
 We saw where the ladies' maids would have stayed.
 And just really, really cool stuff,
 all the kind of stuff that you don't get to see on the normal
 tour.
 So it was fun.
 And then we ate in the stables, because it's
 been converted into a restaurant.
  </li><li>So the hay was more delicious on the thought.
  </li><li>Oh, yummy hay.
  </li><li>Drinking from a trough, it's not that bad.
  </li><li>Stunning.
 But yeah, the food was lovely and the coffee was lovely
 and all that.
 And we didn't do much outside 'cause it was quite bitter,
 you know, in terms of the wind.
 But yeah, it was great.
 And then on the second day, we went back
 and we got to go and see the village that was part of it
 the winery and which is used to be the dairy, the Vanderbilt dairy has been switched into
 a winery and stuff.
 So we just went and did all these really cool tours and learned a whole bunch of stuff.
 And yeah, it was amazing.
 It just filled your history, love tank, nerd tank full, didn't it?
 It did.
 And I also got to test my deer theory.
 You see?
 I'm amazed one has a theory about deer.
 Well, see, we see have so much deer around Franklin, don't we?
 You see them all the time.
  </li><li>You see them.
 I'm always oblivious to them.
  </li><li>Well, I don't know what you're doing.
 I don't know why you can't see them
 'cause I'm like, "Oh, it was practically on the car."
 Anyway, we're driving in onto the estate
 and somebody had told me once,
 "If you see deer, you want a honk
 'cause they'll run from the sound."
 But I thought, "Gosh, if they don't run from the sound,
 "they're gonna run right into your car.
 "So I'd wanna make sure that they run away from the source
 "rather than towards it, if that makes sense."
 So we're driving up and there was a deer
 that was like two meters from the car.
 And I thought, I'm driving slow enough
 that I can absolutely stop.
 So I honked the horn and that thing took off
 away from us as fast as possible.
 It could so.
  </li><li>There you go guys.
  </li><li>There you go.
  </li><li>Dear science available on our pod today.
  </li><li>Don't say we never teach you anything.
  </li><li>Tested so you don't have to.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Last week we were working through questions.
  </li><li>We were.
 Remember and you made me stop because you wanted to sleep. It's very true
 We have I'm gonna do one question not a reader's questions. Okay listeners question. Why do I keep on readers questions?
 I don't know
 Perhaps I know because you're reading them. Oh, yeah, okay. I'm gonna do one more listeners question. Okay. This is from Philippe
 Who says how do you not let other people circumstances steal your joy?
 Hmm
 For several months, I found myself full of joy and very happy in life, but these last few days have been full of sadness.
 Since my sister told me her marriage is in shambles and she doesn't know what to do.
 She's very lonely and sad and I'm looking for practical steps to take so that I don't take on other people's sadness.
 Here's practical step. Just don't.
 Yeah, you, unfortunately, Philippe cannot be responsible for your sister's happiness.
 Right. That's that whole thing of false burden bearing, where you want to fix their problem for them so that you can go back to being happy.
 But it might be good to recognize that your happiness is not dependent on the fruitfulness of their marriage.
 Otherwise, your emotional state will be entirely contingent on their marital state, one which you have no power over.
 I mean, so basically, so you can be there for them and you can mourn with those who mourn,
 but you're a separate person with a separate life. So, I mean, the best thing you can do is
 obviously pray and being as encouraging as you can, but you can't want their healing more than they
 do and you can't fix it for them. So, one of the challenges of being a pastor is this is the kind
 and the stuff that we carry all the time,
 where we're constantly having to give people back
 to the Lord and say, you know,
 I can do my part in terms of I can pray for them
 and I can love them well and try and give them
 sound biblical advice.
 But after that, Lord, I know that this is your suffix
 and not mine to fix and you have to let them have them.
  </li><li>Right, otherwise we'd be coming home.
 And so coming home to a happy house with happy children
 who'd be coming home depressed and, you know,
 unhappy that God has been fixing all these people's lives,
 all these people's lives are in ruins.
 And then our kids, our lives would suck.
 And then our kids lives would suck.
 And so I just manage what's in your hula hoop.
 And as difficult as that sounds, don't manage
 or try to manage what's in other people's hula hoops.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And if that makes no sense, go listen to our boundaries,
 teach you.
 (laughing)
 We had some interesting on the website this week.
  </li><li>We did?
  </li><li>This is only for our UK listeners.
 We've had a bunch of tweets and Facebook
 email request from people who live in the UK who want to get a copy of your book, Finding Father.
 And they come to our website and they order it and they realize that the shipping from America
 to the UK costs more than the book itself.
 Wow.
 So they're like, is there any UK distributors?
 So we're speaking to our publisher to try and get and just see because they have all the retail
 channels in the UK. But in the meantime, we thought, I wonder if there's something clever we can do.
 And so we did a little bit of poking around and we realized that if we ship over a box of eight,
 The price of shipping when you divide all this up drops about $10 a book instead of $30 a book.
 So I wrote a little blog post. If you live in the United Kingdom and you have always wanted a
 copy of AJ's book and you haven't been able to get a hold of it, go to our website and I'll put
 this in the show notes and just fill in a form saying yeah I'd be interested in that. We'll work
 out it works out that I think that the book would cost you including all the shipping to your house
 would cost you about twenty five pounds that's a rough estimate exchange rate of a couple days ago
 the idea is we'd call everybody who wants copy of the book in batches of eight ship them over to a
 friend of ours in the u_k_ who would then ship the individual book from within the u_k_ to somewhere
 else within the u_k_ thus saving you a ton of money on shipping of course you can get the book on
 kindle on the i-book store for your iphone or for your ipad but if you were one of those people
 who loves a paper bag copy and you want to write them.
 I'm one of those people.
 Yeah.
 I like to write and highlight them.
 Those people who like to do that, but you absolutely can.
 As we close, two other things I want to mention.
 This morning at Grace Center, we announced that we have new worship pastors.
 We do.
 In fact, not only new worship pastors, but we have new worship and creative
 arts pastors.
 It's so exciting.
 And they're two of our dear friends, Josh and Sarah Parsons,
 and we wanted to offer congratulations to them.
 We should ask them to come on the podcast at some point and get them to share their story.
 Yeah, they're great.
 Because I love their story.
 And they're hysterical.
 Yeah, they are.
 And that's a reminder.
 If you've been thinking about doing a school of ministry, or if you'd want to go deeper with God,
 or go deeper in your understanding of the supernatural, our school, the school of supernatural life,
 which runs a grace in its starting in September.
 If you would like to apply, applications are now open, go to graceinter.us/school to find out
 all about the school to watch a video testimonies and to apply online, we'd love to have you come
 join us for eight months and learn all about how to hear the voice of God, learn all about the
 father's love, get your heart healed up and learn how to move in the practical gift of the Holy Spirit.
 It would be our privilege and our pleasure to spend eight months training you how to do those
 thing. So anyway, hope you guys have an amazing week. Thank you for joining us and we will see you
 next week. Next week. Next week. Next week. Next week. Next week. Next week. Next week. Next week.
