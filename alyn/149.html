<p> I'm good how are you?<br/>
 I am good.<br/>
 You sound amazing tonight.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 You look amazing.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 I have a full heart.<br/>
 Why so full?<br/>
 Because I'm getting to build stuff.<br/>
 Okay, yes.<br/>
 Why don't we just start right there?<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 The DIY project.<br/>
 I'm DIYing.<br/>
 in blood. What? The paint looks like alien blood. Okay. Well, there's been a mishap with the paint.
 We, uh, the paint that I picked on the actual paint chip looked much lighter and less like
 alien blood than it does on the wall. Well, alien blood's probably it's just a very bright turquoise.
 Is turquoise? Apparently. I thought it was teal. Well, they're in the same family.
 Okay, well, other way it looks like a bunch of aliens got in a fight in our bathroom and their neon remains have splattered the wall.
 It looks a little bit like that, but I'm going to fix it. It's going to be fine. And then I will post it to Instagram.
 Here's the thing. I have great confidence in you to make it brilliant.
 Thank you.<br/>
 In the same way that you have this unfathomable confidence that I will solve technology problems,
 even when I know that it's outside the realms of my capabilities.
 Yes.<br/>
 your belief in me empowers me to do see and vice versa. So you're just happy because you're building.
 I'm building. I'm using power tools. I'm using power tools. I'm using my nail gun and my mitre saw and
 measuring things and cutting wood. Yeah. All right. Well, that's great. But something else happened
 this week that was amazing too. It's true. Even more amazing. We graduated our school.
 Congratulations to all of our graduating students from first and second year. We're so proud of you.
 You've done an amazing job. We had a great night at graduation. I loved it.
 It was really, really good. The hall was full. There was lots of smiling family members and friends.
 Everybody looked so nice. They dressed up real sharp. Nobody fell off the stage. It all went off
 without a hitch. Have we ever had anybody fall off the stage? No, but that's because me and Matt
 help people up and down off the stage because we're gentlemen like that. So thank you to everybody
 who made that year of success. Our staff at the school, Jeff and Becky, it was just a great time.
 I loved it completely. So we had a high of graduation. You had a high of building stuff.
 Yes. You don't know what my personal high was. What was your personal high, darling?
 Getting to go on a date with little Tia. Oh, she was so excited.
 Our slightly for both seven year old had made it known to us that you were...
 Slightly for both. She's very earnest. But she was saying,
 I haven't had enough time with you and you've taken my money on a date and you haven't taken
 me on a date. So she came up with, "I would like to go on a date with you to see Boss Baby at the
 movie theater." And then also we could go for dinner and then also we'd also have popcorn and candy.
 And so I made all our dreams come true and it was amazing. MJ did mention on Friday night
 when you were gone. He was like, "Where did they go, Mummy?" And I said, "They went on a date." And
 And he said, "Do they get to go see Boss Baby?"
 And I said, "I think she's seeing Boss Baby.
 I want Daddy to take me to see Boss Baby."
</p><ul>
  <li>It was very cute.
 I loved it.
 My favorite part was we ended up eating at Panda Express
 for no other reason than it was one of two restaurants
 right next to the movie theater
 and she didn't want to go Panera Bread.
 In fact, we walked into Panera Bread and she said,
 "This is not the restaurant I was thinking of."
 (laughs)
 Turn around left.
  </li><li>The child knows what she wants.
  </li><li>So we went to Panda Express,
 which for those of you who know what Panda Express is,
 it's not the world's greatest Chinese food restaurant ever.
 It's like a chain.
  </li><li>No, yes.
  </li><li>Well, she was thrilled with it.
 She sat there with cheeks full of fried rice
 and she said, "Daddy, let's make this our special restaurant
 that nobody needs to know about."
 And I thought, "I don't think the world's gonna be angry
 about that, babe."
 (laughs)
 So anyway, yeah, my daddy heart was full
 just being with her this weekend.
  </li><li>And I took Abby to a girls thing on Thursday, didn't I?
  </li><li>So really the only child with left out is MJ.
 MJ, he's owed a date.
 No, well, that's not true because I bought him a $2 toy at the bargain store.
 And he just thought it was the best thing ever.
 This unsolicited gift, we were just wondering around the store.
 Yes, but he's the cuddliest child you've ever met.
 So he's going to want the quality diamond.
 And it was a ninja turtle.
 I don't know.
 It's a stupid like paddle with a ball attached to it.
 I don't know what it's supposed to do with it.
 Bong, bong, bong, something like that.
 I don't know. Take out your eye.
 Anyway, he loved it.
 He just, daddy, did you just buy me that?
 I said, yeah, he said, why?
 I said, because I love you.
 You're the best daddy ever.
 So my family love tank is full.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Speaking about families and babies and where they come from.
  </li><li>Huh?
  </li><li>Well, and I'm trying to say,
 we're going to talk about marriage
 and introduce our guest tonight.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I was like, were we speaking of babies
 and where they came from?
  </li><li>We have babies.
  </li><li>And are these guys gonna talk about babies
 and where they came from?
 I don't think so.
  </li><li>Well, tell us why we're so excited.
  </li><li>We are so excited because we have Mike and Phyllis
 best with us this evening.
 We do.
 Mike and Phyllis, welcome to the podcast.
 Thank you.
 Thanks.
 You guys are best known in our community as a married couple who have a heart to help
 strengthen marriages.
 That's something that we really enjoy and appreciate because we prayed about that and
 we want that to be true.
 We've had other people in the RTF community that say we don't want to be known for certain
 things.
 We had a conversation about eight years ago and I said,
 we do want to be known for that.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So.
  </li><li>I want it to be known and I hope you're okay
 with this being known that while you guys have,
 it seems like specialized in marriages,
 you still absolutely minister to single people,
 people who are getting married, divorced people.
 I mean, you minister to all sorts of people, correct?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But your heart and it just seems the thing
 that comes out with you, the fruit that's from your lives
 is you love helping people in married life.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>And all the marriages I know that you have touched
 have flourished because of that.
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
  </li><li>Let me start with some basic questions.
 How long have you guys been married?
  </li><li>39 years in May.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>Wow, congratulations.
 That's amazing.
 And how long have you been ministering to people before?
  </li><li>In the 80s, our church asked us to do life groups.
 So we started with the life group on marriage
 because it was what we knew something about
 because we'd been doing it for probably five years.
 were experts by then. Yes. But for some reason, we've talked about the several times. We don't
 even know why we got so intense and excited and attracted to marriages and helping couples.
 And we've always had a patient for married couples ever since we were in our 30s, 30 years
 ago. And it's just a big joy to us. We do it together. Our hearts are for it. It's easy
 for us. We say we think with a marriage filter, we just see life that way.
 So, Phyllis, for people listening that may not be aware of what it is that you guys do,
 could you explain a little bit about how do you minister to people?
 The basic thing that we do is restoring the foundations, which is just a basic foundational
 clearing out the junk ministry.
 And we feel like everybody needs that.
 If they're alive and breathing,
 we all have stuff that we carry.
 And so we do that,
 but we also incorporate some other things to help couples.
 Life languages being one of them.
  </li><li>Oh, cool.
  </li><li>Yes, we love the life languages.
  </li><li>We've benefited from both those things.
 In fact, I wanted to talk about how we first met you.
 And so I'm going to go to story time.
 A long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, our pastors from Canada met our
 pastors who are in Nashville.
 So this is John and Carol, meet Jeff and Becky.
 And John and Carol had been through what we call RTF or restoring the foundations,
 which I think we've talked about a bit on the podcast.
 And John and Carol were saying, Jeff and Becky, you need to go do RTF.
 It's amazing.
 And one of the funny things about RTF is it's very hard to describe what it is that's so
 amazing without going through it.
 I mean, you can for sure break it down what it is, but it's the value you receive from
 going through it.
 It's one of those weird things.
 So Jeff and Becky, I think, I don't want to put words in their mouth, but maybe reluctantly
 went, you know, I think they went because John and Carol said go.
 And so they went out to the restoring foundations base in North Carolina, went through this,
 we call a healing week, which is five days in a married couple.
 I think it's three days if you're, I mean, you guys are the experts.
 Yes. You guys are nodding.
 And so, you know, Jeff and Becky went through these five days.
 They would tell you this as they've shared publicly many times.
 And they were like, this is life changing.
 Like this is life changing.
 And they promptly came home and thought, we need to send all of our
 pastors and staff through this and quickly realized that logistically
 sending everybody out to North Carolina,
 would be good for the life of our church,
 would be just prohibitive for a number of reasons.
 And so they asked you guys to kind of come down to Nashville
 on extended trips and just all of our,
 almost all of our passes and staff at the time
 went through this restoring the foundation's healing week.
 My memory's certainly correct.
  </li><li>That's correct.
  </li><li>And is that how you ended up at Grace Center?
 Just tell us that story of how you ended up at Grace Center
 because later on it seemed like you guys moved here
 and now you're permanently part of our church.
 We love that.
 (laughing)
 Talk to us about your introduction to Grace Center,
 how you, your side of that story.
  </li><li>Well, we did start coming.
 The ministry said, "Hey, would you guys be willing
 "to go to Nashville and do some ministry to church there
 "and they want their staff to go through?"
 And we said, "Sure, that'd be great.
 "We love adventure, we like travel,
 "we like being on the road."
 And we went to Grace Center.
 And it was back in the days when Chris McCarny
 doing worship. That very first Sunday, it's like, wow, this is an amazing church. This is just
 fantastic. We loved it so much, cried about halfway through the service. And we came back
 over a four-year period. We made 17 trips. Good night. Stave with six different families,
 and we added up the weeks, and over four years, we were in Nashville about one of those years
 when you edited it all up. Wow. That's amazing. I know you were here a lot. I didn't realize
 it was that much. So obviously you had to move here. I mean, you know.
 We did. We loved it here. And everybody was so welcoming and just really embraced ministry
 and us. And it was just a, we just felt like the Lord eventually said, it's time to quit making
 the trips every month or so and just move. Our community is so much a better community because
 because you guys are here.
 All the people, all our friends, our family,
 the people that you've ministered to over the years,
 we've just benefited from you guys being here.
 You've ministered at the church,
 you've done marriage teaching on our Wednesday nights.
 And again, your full-time jobs are ministering to people.
  </li><li>Correct.
  </li><li>What did you guys do before you were in ministry?
  </li><li>I was a nurse and Mike is an engineer.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was an automotive engineer.
 Engineers are problem solvers.
 Nurses have big hearts to help people.
 And so the combination seemed to work pretty good.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'd say so. (laughs)
  </li><li>We literally could spend hours picking your brain
 on the full spectrum of healing.
 Questions about demons and deliverance
 and past hurts and soul spirit hurts and this,
 that we could just, we could spend all the evening
 talk about that. But one of the reasons we invited you on was to talk about marriage,
 to just come and share some of your wisdom about marriage. And we've got a bunch of questions
 we'd love to ask experts on marriage, which is you guys. I know you just look to each other
 like, wait, who are they talking about? So babe, what question would you love to ask?
 What are some of the main things that you see in marriages that start to cause breakdown?
 Are there any things that you're like, you know, when we start to see a combination of
 these two or these three things that you start to go, "Oh, you probably want to deal with
 those because those are eventually going to erode your marriage."
 I feel like every couple is so different.
 I don't know that I could say that there are specific things.
 I mean, there's basic things like learning how to forgive and those kinds of things.
 But every couple seems to bring their own unique, what they brought into the marriage,
 how they grew up, what they learned from their family of origin.
 And they always just respond differently.
 And so I feel like most couples are fairly unique.
 Wow.
 I did not expect that answer.
 That's fascinating.
 I would agree with Phyllis, but I would say the things that we commonly see, though
 they're different. We started seeing this almost from the start when we were doing ministry,
 we would see a couple and we go, "That's a gift problem." Like the wife would be prophetic
 and the husband would be real gentle and tenderhearted. And she would think that he was weak
 and wasn't direct enough. And he would think that she was harsh and critical. And everybody
 He was kind of acting a little bit out of being unhealed, but we would look at it and
 go, that's a gift problem.
 That's how they are.
 And the one common thing we see with almost every couple is each mate judges the other
 mate based on who they are.
 If you're a leader, you look at your wife and go, you're not a very good leader.
 If the wife is real merciful, she looks at the husband and says, you don't care about
 me, you are harsh, you are, and the things are usually true, but it's really gift mix
 issues that seem to be the biggest problem in marriage.
 Whoa. I'm just thinking about how freeing that would be, where suddenly you're validated
 rather than criticized for the way you are. And then also learning, okay, even though your
 out is that do you realize that you're looking at your wife and judging her through your filter
 of the way you see things? Yes. That must be so freeing for people to hear and see.
 It is. And it's just fascinating that we don't even realize that we all have individual ways
 that God created us and that were gifted and those filters really direct incoming and outgoing
 communication. Right. Let's just stop there, maybe in a moment to forgive one another.
 You know, really, we've pitched this as a podcast, but we just want to like free marriage.
 Free counseling.
 On here. So this is perfect. We can just lead us in a prayer.
 It's fantastic though. If he can show a spouse how to communicate with the other,
 and it's almost always the one that's a tenderhearted one, you know, if you just
 demonstrate that you wait he just pointed to himself he thinks he's
 a tender hearted one.
 I didn't mean it. My tender heart's being crushed by that.
 But it's just it's fabulous. I had you know we can't really talk about specifics but had a
 guy a couple years ago that I saw in church and he goes you know the first you know several
 decades of our marriage were really bad. And then when I learned how to treat my wife as a
 responder and show her that I cared, he goes, it was simple, but it was amazingly beneficial.
 And she doesn't remember what you did for her. All she remembers is what you did for me, but I
 don't care how she interprets it. All I know is our marriage is great now.
  </li><li>That's awesome.
  </li><li>Those kinds of stories, they're simple. The gift stuff is not complicated.
 Most people don't know how they're gifted and they don't know how they communicate.
 It's not hard. It's usually a lot of benefit for a little bit of effort for a couple.
 So I find it really interesting and amazing that you guys have combined RTF with life languages.
 Because obviously we went through RTF. We didn't do life languages at the same time. We did life
 languages at a different time. It was very helpful. But when I heard that you guys were doing that,
 I thought, "Oh my gosh, that's brilliant," because you not only get to deal with your stuff,
 but then you get to work out how to communicate with one another afterwards,
 which is a perfect way to sort of launch back into, "Let's do this a different way now."
 So where did you get that idea from?
 Actually, it came from, we were just observing. We'd go, "See the couples?" We go,
 That's a gift problem.
 We didn't have a tool for that.
 And then someone in the RTF community named David Linda Rader, we're doing life
 languages.
 The whole RTF staff went through it and I go, this tool is the tool.
 They trained us in it.
 We started taking couples through about five years ago.
 We got this is descriptive of what's going on.
 It gives a good distribution of what the gifts and communication patterns are.
 And it's just valuable.
 We don't know of any other tool available.
 It does what Life Languages does.
 But it was the tool we go,
 these people have already done the work.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>All the couple has to do is go out, take the profile,
 and then the information is there to solve the problem.
  </li><li>Yeah, so cool.
  </li><li>And for those of you who are maybe newer to the podcast
 and you're unfamiliar with this term Life Languages,
 we interviewed one of our friends
 who's a Life Language trainer, Alison Hendrickson.
 If you go to <a href="mailto:ellen@naj.com">ellen@naj.com</a>/76 or <a href="mailto:ellen@naj.com">ellen@naj.com</a>/77,
 you can hear Alison share in depth about life languages
 and the importance of it.
 But in summary, it's a communication tool
 that helps people understand
 how they are predominantly wired for communication
 and how to learn to communicate in styles
 that they may not be as fluent in.
 And it is life-changing.
 has helped our community hugely both our church staff and grace in or at large.
 Similar to the question that AJ asked you, what are some of the most common things
 husbands don't understand about their wives?
 That's an interesting question because we don't really see a hall at a men, women.
 Almost everything we see is more from a what your wounds and how to those impact now.
 what is your gifting? How does that work now? We don't see a whole lot of men, women kind of
 things. We're looking to solve things at the root cause. And so we don't really do as much,
 okay, you're a man, so you should think this way. You're a woman, so you should be this way.
 I just don't think that way as much.
 Although, Levin Respect talks about that a lot because, you know, our brains are wired
 a little differently.
 But some of the things that we see more commonly are not being able to see our own stuff.
 And it doesn't matter if you're the husband or wife.
 Most of the time when people come in, they want us to look at their spouse.
 Right.
 If you just fix my spouse, my marriage would be better.
 Yes.
  </li><li>Yes, and so communication, and I guess it just goes back
 to back in the garden with the finger pointing.
 You know, it's, if you'll just, it was just Adam
 and that woman that you gave me.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So that's just our tendency.
 It seems like to look at them rather than our own lives.
 And I just know from my own life,
 I think God uses marriage more than any other relationship
 on the earth to make us look at maybe what's going on in our own lives.
 And our tendency, as I said, is just to look at what they need to fix. But I know in my own life,
 if I look at me rather than continuing to look at what he needs to do, it seems like I don't have
 have to go around that mountain again. So we love a marriage in that it can be one of
 the most damaging relationships on the earth, but it can also be one of the most amazing
 relationships on earth as you learn to grow together.
 That's fascinating to me because I've listened to both your answers and I was thinking like
 In our experience, we often show up, but we're being incredibly serious that you've probably heard us say early on in our marriage, we had to figure out when AJ was upset.
 Men have this lovely tendency where they just want to fix the problem, so they stop hearing about the problem.
 Whereas women often just want to be heard and comforted.
 They're bringing a problem to be heard, not to be fixed, which is alien to the male mind.
 So I'm thinking, wait, why don't you guys mention that one? Like, isn't that obvious to you?
 And then I realized you're not you're not dealing with the problems that are up here.
 And for those of you who can't see me, I'm motioning up high. The ministry is called
 restoring the foundations because that just tends to be a fruit thing if you can minister
 down here. So I hadn't even considered the that you're going to have to far deeper,
 more significant issues. Is that a correct? Now I'm unsure about everything, but
 we'll go back to school with these guys. Yeah, you know, a while ago, you said, well, you know,
 we can talk about the foreign ministry areas and we almost never get into that conversation with
 people because it's not very persuasive and it's not very motivating to people. You just tell them
 that. But when you say, okay, here's, here's the thing. RTF will help you to solve the key issues
 in your life, the deepest issues at the root cause using Christian principles.
 We tell them that.
 That makes sense to people more than we're going to do these four ministry areas and
 usually say that their eyes glaze over and you know that you didn't connect with their
 heart.
 So either RTF is going to help you solve your issues at the root cause or we give them testimonies
 and people go, "This is what happened in our life."
 They go, "Oh."
 So it's that kind of thing.
 This will actually get to the root of what's happening in our life.
 That's really the key idea is we're not telling people, "Here's your bad behavior.
 Do this better."
 Those are pretty easy to figure out, but it doesn't help anybody because our behavior,
 when we get under stress, we're going to do it again.
 In our mind, we know that it's wrong until we get the root thing healed that causes to
 react poorly.
 We're going to keep doing that when we're under stress.
 Yeah.
 Makes sense.
 Well, okay.
 How about this question?
 What are some of the best preventative steps that folks can do while they're single to
 prepare for married life?
 I would say get as much healing as you can.
 Yeah.
 Before you even go into marriage because then you're not working with two cycles, your own
 and theirs, because we all bring so much stuff into our marriages.
 We often joke that our marriage problems start when we are five years old.
 But we learn things from our families of origin.
 We learn how to handle conflict or not.
 We learn how to deal with feelings or even the feelings are okay to have.
 We learn how to forgive or not.
 I mean, there's so many things that we learn just from growing up that we don't even think
 about that we bring into the marriage that we just think everybody else is that way.
 Right.
 And so just recognizing any wounds, because we've all been hurt in life, it may be families
 of origin or it may just be from living life.
 And we develop beliefs and different ways of interacting out of that.
 And so just looking at those kinds of things and getting as much taken care of as you can
 before you get married, you start off in a way better place.
 Right. Sounds good.
 And you tend to attract a different level of health. I've noticed that the more,
 here's one of the most perplexing things that I've seen, is incredible women who end up in
 relationships with some questionable characters. And as pastors, when we've sat down with
 with them when that relationship inevitably crashes and burns because there's a huge mismatch,
 not just in personality, but also in maturity, perhaps maturity socially, maturity with the Lord.
 We're thinking, how is this incredibly godly, beautiful, incredibly,
 appearingly confident woman attracted to this severely insecure, somewhat broken individual,
 and you realize that person is actually a reflection of how this person sees himself.
 We notice that the more healing you get, you tend to radiate and attract different out me.
 Calibernal. We radiate confidence. We attract a different type of person. We radiate rejection.
 We attract a different kind of person. More confident out going, people go, "Oh, they must beThey 
 must have some health. Yeah, when we get our self healed and start looking at our identity,
 the way God sees us and start radiating that and start expecting more. We don't we won't settle for
 something different. God has something great for me. We're looking for something good. We're looking
 for a good mate. We're not looking to settle. We're looking for what God has for us.
 So it changes the whole ball game. One of the things that we saw in Nashville that we hadn't seen
 before, because we were in a retirement community in North Carolina. But with the young people,
 with several young people come for ministry, and the problem was they were 30ish, 35ish,
 and wanted to be married and couldn't figure out what the roadblock was. They dated several times,
 but it usually ended not well, and just didn't know what was going on. So we were able to talk
 through some of those things.
 And actually we saw several people that came for RTF get married.
 It's a result of their history time.
 Come on.
 So yeah, that was thoroughly.
 I mean, we had no idea that that was going to happen.
 And it was really exciting.
 That's awesome.
 So you say that and me and probably every single person who's listening is like,
 tell us the answer.
 What were some of the roadblocks?
 And I'd imagine it would vary from person to person.
 But are there any general things you can share?
 I think there's a commonality in it.
 I don't deserve at some level.
 People didn't feel like they deserved somebody good.
 And there was a fear of rejection sometimes of,
 I've got to reject people before they reject me.
 Sometimes that's a common thing that people do.
 And I think it's underestimating
 what they really deserve and what God really wants.
 And so radiating it, I don't deserve to be loved kind of a thing.
 And even a desperation when you don't think you deserve to be loved,
 then sometimes you can be desperate and settle.
 Wow.
 And that's not attractive.
 Right.
 When you feel like you deserve to be married and God wants you to be married
 and you are beautiful and you are kind and you are thoughtful.
 And the things that God says about your identity, you project something
 different and you attract something different.
 Yeah.
 You know, here's an amazing business opportunity for you guys
 is to create like some sort of downloadable identity statement
 for for dating, you know, kind of like the is smart eyes, kind
 eyes, wonderful thing.
 I'm sure people would love it.
 I think that's a fantastic idea.
 But here's the beauty of what makes identity work is it's not,
 there's not a I am smart.
 I am beautiful.
 What's what is what is powerful about the identity thing is when
 you figure out who God says you are.
 Yeah.
 And that's what makes it unique.
 Because if you just said, you know, I'm smart, I'm attractive, I'm kind, these kinds of things, you'd become, what kind of already knew that?
 But when God says something about you and he just says it directly to you, that identity has life and it's infinitely more life than anything with kind of a generic approach.
 It's the life that's coming from inside out,
 rather than trying to talk it into you
 with some of the generic identity statements.
 Is that what you're saying?
 Yes.
 And it's who you are.
 And usually when people figure out who their identity is
 and it comes from God,
 it's something they probably haven't heard before.
 When God says something to you,
 it's a level of truth that it impacts your heart
 in a really deep and profound way.
 It's funny that even in saying,
 And of course, I'm not picking on you, Alan,
 'cause I think most people would love to just have
 a statement that we could say.
 But it's funny how we as human beings,
 just in general, like to have a method
 as opposed to having to really go back
 for a relationship.
 Do you know what I mean?
 So like what you are saying is,
 hey, out of relationship with a father,
 let him speak truth to you and believe that,
 where we would love to just have four-line prayers
 for everything.
  </li><li>We just don't love them, right?
  </li><li>Right, that we could just download a memorized,
 But that's really no different in a lot of ways
 than just memorizing scripture verses
 and trying to beat yourself up with them.
 If it's truth from the Father,
 it's just a different strength of revelation.
  </li><li>Is it a whole different level in your book,
 finding Father changed our identity.
 The same way we went through that book.
 I could remember some of the things God said.
 That was identity inducing,
 and even at our age,
 where God's still shifting identity around it,
 made a profound during that time period.
 It was four or five years ago.
 There was nothing that made more impact in our life and changed than that book.
 That's true.
 Wow.
 That's awesome.
 Thanks.
 Hugely impactful to us for the people who can't see age's face.
 There's some weird moisture growing in your eyes.
 Yeah.
 It was a bug.
 A bug flew my eye.
 That's what it was.
 You know, what God says it to you, it's absolutely the truth and infinitely impactful.
 and nothing else anybody else could say can do that like God can.
 Yeah.
 One of the other things that is really impactful along those same lines are,
 you know, how our church has been doing declarations and you talked about that one time,
 just making declarations over your marriage.
 What does God say about your specific marriage and doing that together and then just declaring
 his truth over your life.
 Amazing impact.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Let's start doing that.
  </li><li>My mind went somewhere that I can't say on my best behavior.
  </li><li>They didn't say declarations over your sex life.
 They said declaration over your marriage.
  </li><li>I'm sure that's included.
  </li><li>But I know what you were thinking.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Of course you knew why I was thinking.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>But a declaration might be something like,
 We're forever people.
 We're gonna have a forever marriage.
 And when you approach marriage with that perspective,
 it's like, there's certain things we're not gonna do.
 'Cause we're gonna go forever.
 We're going all the way to the end.
 We're gonna get old together.
 We're gonna get wrinkles together.
 We're gonna finish well together.
 And there's just certain things you just don't do.
 There's certain conversations you don't have.
 There's certain ways you just don't act.
 And because you're in it for the long haul,
 it's not a if this doesn't work out, I'm going to change partners is no, we have to make this thing
 work. Right. So there's not a plan B, there's no other option. There's no plan B. So you're on your
 best behavior, kind of like when you're dating, you always putting your best foot forward, we'll
 keep doing it in marriage because if you're going for the gold, there's a certain things you don't do.
 You guys are so prophetic. You're actually answering the next question I had, which is
 what are some of the best prevented to steps folks can take to create and protect a healthy
 marriage. So you've already talked about making declarations already talked about making a commitment,
 having a longer term view than just, I remember Danny silks saying, most people only plan their
 wedding, they never plan their marriage. And so having a longer view than just the wedding day
 is important. What other things do you know, practical things can people do, obviously come
 and get a healing week, come and do some ministry.
 What are some other practical things you encourage couples to do in their marriage?
 One thing that's really important, I feel like, is just learning how to forgive well.
 And often.
 Yes.
 Daily.
 Easy.
 Easy.
 And we have a three-part thing that we like to teach couples because most of the time
 And we just say, "I'm sorry."
 But we feel like when you say it,
 "I'm sorry for what you did."
 And that was wrong because acknowledging the pain
 that you caused your spouse,
 and then will you forgive me?
 So it would sound like,
 "I'm sorry for walking away from you
 "when you were trying to talk with me."
 That was wrong because it was very disrespectful to you.
 I was only thinking in myself, would you forgive me?
  </li><li>Yes, I forgive you,
 but I would also like to ask you to forgive me
 for the tone that I was using and even the attitude
 I had as we were talking,
 'cause that wasn't very respectful and that was wrong.
 Would you please forgive me for that?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>These are not paid actors, that's a real--
  </li><li>That's a real conversation.
  </li><li>Mike and Phyllis,
 (laughing)
 event.
  </li><li>I have no idea what you're talking about.
  </li><li>Yeah, never happens.
  </li><li>We didn't have one of those.
 Just at dinner today.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>It's so powerful.
 I'm sorry I was wrong, please forgive me.
 I was wrong as a really important thing.
 Leave out the butt, 'cause everything I'm there's a butt.
 I'm sorry that I talked butt,
 if you wouldn't have, just totally leave it out.
 It's always there, but if you bring it up,
 it wrecks your apology.
 Mm hmm.
 Yep.
 So good.
 That's amazing.
 Any other little nuggets you can throw our way?
 There's one.
 I'm going to steal this one from Billy Graham, but a long time ago, Billy Graham said he's
 never alone with another woman that's not his wife.
 And even when he travels, he's on the road.
 He says, okay, if somebody comes up and picks me at the airport, I want it to be a man.
 Do not send a woman to pick me up.
 Yeah.
 That's fascinating.
 He goes, I've never had a problem with adultery because I've never been alone with another woman
 other than my wife. So I was saying to the boundaries early, saying to them firm and that
 may sound really old school, but that's a good way to a fair proof your marriage is
 just set the boundaries firm, set them early and stick to them.
 That's one of the things that they encourage us to do when we were itinerating in Toronto.
 Like I started itinerating, you know, just as a single female for about five years before
 Alan and I got married and started deteriorating.
 And that was one of the things, actually, that Jack Frost as well used to do.
 And so that was one of the things that I was part of my rider.
 Like, if you send a man to pick me up, I won't get in the car.
 It's, you know, no offense or anything.
 But hey, I'm going to play this thing safe, you know, kind of thing.
 And I wasn't even married then.
 I was just like, you just don't need any kind of question available.
 You know, so I love that.
 That's really good.
 Another thing that I might add is if you're struggling in your marriage,
 hang out with a healthy couple.
 Wow.
 Statistics show that hanging out or being around or having relationship with a healthy couple
 is just as effective as being with a licensed counselor.
 Are you serious?
 Yes, isn't that amazing?
 But you catch so much about relationship, about interacting,
 in those kinds of things. And so that's just a tip that we like to also.
 You know, it's so good.
 So funny you say that because A.G. and I often point to when we first got married,
 we lived with John and Carol and we knew that there was value added to our marriage by that.
 But they didn't quote unquote "do anything." Like we just did life with them.
 Yes.
 We were traveling. They were traveling. But when we'd be home, we'd often eat a meal together.
 the advantage of them living upstairs from us is if we had a fight, you know, they heard it.
 They heard it and they would be like, they'd wait about half an hour. They'd be like,
 "You guys okay? You can come and talk?" Or if we needed help, we'd just put popcorn on
 because Carol, it's like catnip. Carol would smell the popcorn and she'd come down.
 But the value of having an amazing, and they, you know, John and Carol would tell stories about
 themselves or tell on themselves about, you know, one time Carol was so mad that she didn't talk to
 John for X number of days.
 You know, all these sorts of things
 and it humanizes these people who look like
 they have this perfect marriage.
 And, you know, it's, so that's amazing.
 That must be the thing that we experienced.
  </li><li>It was.
  </li><li>We would send the money from professional licensed
 counseling fees.
  </li><li>I think that makes me sort of even more excited
 'cause Alan and I have a vision to be able to do that here,
 you know, to have a young couple that lives with us
 that we can, you know, and that sort of makes it make more sense why it, why, you don't
 even why it worked. Like we just sort of know that it did work.
 We want to pass it off.
 Yeah, and we want to pass it off.
 Yeah, for sure. And you don't even have to live with somebody. You know, you can just
 go to dinner with somebody or spend time or go to the park or to the movie, you know,
 whatever, but just spending time and you just pick up things from them that is not
 taught.
 Right.
 That makes sense.
 I think one of the things that is also just really important is just choose kindness.
 It sounds so simple, but when push comes to shove, if you can make a choice to choose
 kindness, it's huge in a marriage or in any relationship.
 Did you hear that, Ajay?
  </li><li>I got it, thanks.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I'm gonna have to edit that.
 We got, that was supposed to be funny, but it didn't work.
  </li><li>It's kind of funny.
  </li><li>I heard somebody say it recently,
 I don't have to be right, I just have to be nice.
 And I'm thinking, well, that's pretty a profound, you know?
 I don't have to always have the last word.
  </li><li>Always have the answer.
 always have the answer, but if you can choose to just be kind to the other person.
 And sometimes it's just a simple, you look out, okay, what would be more kind,
 what would be less kind? Okay, I'm choosing the more kind option here.
 And just tend to do that every chance you get really helps things out a lot.
 Jeff said something to you, didn't he?
 When we first moved here, I think we'd been here like a year or two,
 year or two and Alan and I had had this huge fight.
 Huge fight.
 Huge fight.
 And I had told him to get out of the house.
 I was so mad.
 And I was more than ab to get out of the house
 until I got in the car and I stormed off.
 And I'm like, you know what, Lord, I'm gonna,
 I'm gonna teach her.
 And the Lord's like, oh, what's your plan?
 I'm like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna stay all night
 and she's not gonna know where I am.
 I'm gonna turn off my phone.
 And the Lord's like, oh great.
 Where are you gonna stay?
 And I'm like, I'm just gonna get a hotel
 and the Lord's like, with what money?
 (laughing)
 We had like no money.
 That's not going to work.
 So I'm like, well, I'm just going to go Starbucks and.
 And salt.
 I'm like, OK, what's the shelf life on the sulking thing?
 So I call Jeff and just Jeff, a teenager, said this huge fight.
 And Jeff said, well, Alan, I guess you're going to have to decide whether you'd
 rather be right or have relationship.
 And he said, Alan, I've learned that he who apologizes first wins.
 I was not in the mood to do any of the things that you're talking about.
 But again, I just realized what is the end.
 I didn't realize the Holy Spirit showed me like, what?
 Okay.
 So you're sulking.
 I get that.
 You're really angry.
 You're really hurt.
 Totally get that.
 How long is that going to last?
 Cause the sun is going down and you don't want to go down your anger and the sun's
 coming up and you have to go to your job.
 And by the way, you work with her.
 How long, you know, at some point, you know, you're
 And you know you're not getting divorced.
 At some point you have to return.
 Why not return with humility?
 I'm like, "Oh, wow."
 That's true.
 So we're choosing kindness, folks.
 Yeah.
 So you guys are not just trained in RTF, but like we mentioned earlier, you're also trained
 as life language people.
 And so one of the things that's very, very helpful in the world of life language is this
 whole thing of cross talks where you take a profile, say from a husband and a profile
 from a wife and using some, you know, magic formula, you work out the cross talks at areas
 of conflict. And it just so happens that we haven't to have our life language profiles
 here. And we're wondering whether you could just do like an on air cross talk and identify
 some of our areas.
 Sure.
 This will be fine.
 This could be entertaining.
 I would write that.
 This could be entertaining.
 Yeah, we're, we love the lifelike widgets.
 Yeah, this is good.
 So you guys, life languages are really similar in the top.
 Yeah, they are.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 So while these guys are looking over our profiles, let me explain what's going on.
 For those of you who don't know about life languages, you basically go to a website,
 you fill out a series of questions which produces a profile that gives you some results of your
 most fluent ways of communicating the seven life languages. They all have a name each language
 has a filter the way you see things in life the way you approach things they have they
 have strengths and weaknesses with each one of them but after you fill out the profile
 you're given a chart that tells you your strength or your fluency in each of these languages
 and what these guys are doing right now is they're looking at AJ's profile they're looking
 at my profile and they're using their training and their experience to say, "Hey, it would
 not surprise us if some of the areas of communication conflict would appear here or here or here."
 So right now I need to find some music to be playing while I'm looking at this stuff.
 Exactly.
 Okay.
 Do you want to start, baby?
 You want me to?
 Well, the amazing thing about you too is that your giftings are so similar in so many areas,
 the top ones.
 Many times conflict comes more when our giftings are so different, but you guys are similarly
 gifted in a lot of areas with both of you being shaper as your top gifting, which is
 leadership.
 And so the thing that I would wonder is, who's going to be the leader?
 Do you ever have conflict with who's in charge?
 We used to.
 We used to have a lot more than we do now.
 But when we first got married, we would both wake up and literally our eyes were open and
 we would form a plan.
 But we wouldn't communicate our plan to one another, but we both believe that each of
 our plans was the best plan.
 And so our conflict would arise from him having an idea that was outside of my plan or me
 having an idea that was outside of his.
 And now we've got to a place where we realize, I mean, you can see from ages results, she's
 an off the charts shaper.
 What is she?
 You can come down though, I used to be 97.
 So I feel like I've mellowed at 93.
 She's 93.
 So we're first, so the shaper again for people who are not familiar with this terminology,
 shapers love to plan.
 They love to lead.
 I think after all these years of marriage, we've realized all there's areas that AJ can
 out plan me. The stuff I just don't care about that's more passionate to her. And so
 I, as I say, I let you lead. That sounds ridiculous. But we both benefit when you lead
 and conversely there's there is now there are times when our plans overlap. But I think
 we've done a good job. I'm just trying to think like we even had a conversation today
 on the way to one of our meetings in the car where we're, you know, there's a little bit of
 miscommunication about what each of us was saying. But I mean, think we were well, didn't you say
 it wasn't conflict. It was just like, yep, I get it. But yes, early on, huge problem. But and we
 realized either we hadn't communicated the plan or our plan was being threatened.
 And now we're much better at real life.
 Both of us, because we're high shapers, realize that when there's a change to the plan,
 either because of weather or timing or other people, we realize, oh, we get in distress,
 but we've learned those signals and we talk each other down, which is good.
 We have looked at with every couple of you seen probably for the last five years,
 we've gone over life languages with them. And I have never seen a couple as similar.
 Your top three languages being the same and in the same order. And even probably at least it's
 important that your bottom life language is the same responder, which is the mercy gift.
 And so that you're so the same. Like Phyllis said, Phyllis and I are both leaders.
 And sometimes what we have to do is this is a conversation.
 We go to cook together and it's okay, who's going to be the chef?
 Who's going to be the sous chef?
 Or if we're going to hang a mirror together, who's going to be the one that's calling the shots?
 And who's going to be the helper because we both want to lead.
 Right.
 And that's important.
 But so I would think that would be part of it.
 But the fact that both of your responders are low.
 Um, is kind of interesting.
 And I would wonder if as a couple, sometimes you might feel like you don't care, even
 though neither one of you is a high responder.
 So it's not like here looking for that.
 But I wonder if there might be times where you're going, I just don't feel like you
 care about me.
 And just because it's responders, just not a high.
 Yeah.
 You guys are all about business.
 I mean, you're, you're probably both very smart and very action-oriented, very much get things done.
 Yeah.
 Our earliest profile is 2004.
 We've kept all our profiles throughout the years.
 So we've got maybe four profiles, you know, every five years or every three years we've done it.
 And we can see the stage of life we were in.
 Because when we met, our profiles were very different to that.
 My influencer was very, very high.
 My shaper was quite high, but then early on in marriage, my shaper just dropped because I realized
 there's no need for it. There's a 97% shaper. And as you know, shapers are happy to lead,
 but they're also happy to be led if there's a competent leader. And so mine just dropped.
 And my doer came way up, especially when we moved to Gray Center, our dynamic would be
 Ajay would plan. I would do. Yeah, I was sort of shaped by the thing. Here you go. This is what
 emanate's going to look at. And he would just take the checklist and make it all happen.
 and build the website, do the blah blah,
 and then I'd move on to, okay,
 this is what encounter we can's gonna look like,
 and he'd do the manual, do the, you know,
 so it was, yeah, I mean, that's what we--
  </li><li>That worked well, but--
  </li><li>So we did everything.
  </li><li>Your comment about the responder,
 I'd never even thought about in those terms
 that yes, both of our responders are low,
 mine is notoriously low,
 but because I work with all responders,
 I've learned to speak it.
 Fairly fluently when I'm deliberate,
 often catastrophically terrible when I think I'm getting away with speaking it fluently.
 If I'm intentional and turn it on, I'm good. If I think I can coast with it, a train wreck
 happens inevitably. But I'd never thought about it in the terms of everybody has a
 responder. Mine happens to be low. Is it low out of wounding, perhaps? Is it low because it's
 being suppressed? But when you said, I wonder if both of you at times feel like you don't care,
 That would be a thing where I'm like, "Babe, I feel uncomfortable with the language,
 of course, with it being so low." But I'm like, "Babe, I feel like you don't care about this."
 And vice versa, that's fascinating.
 So that's bang on. That's probably one of the more common type of conversations that we would have.
 What are you guys doing next week?
 It needs to get sorted out.
 Can we hang out with you?
 My responder used to be third.
 Right.
 It's just sort of steadily moved its way down to the bottom.
 It's interesting how different things shift in different seasons of life,
 depending on what you need at that particular season of life.
 We speak responder to our kids because they're very, very high responders.
 T is a very high conan player.
 Our responder sometimes comes out to play, but MJ and Abby, I would imagine,
 our first language responders.
 I mean, MJ, every night when he goes to bed, says, "Mommy, I need to know what the plan is for tomorrow."
 What's the plan for the morning?
 And he did. If the babysitter doesn't tell him the plan, when I'll go in and kiss him at night,
 he'll be like, "What, the plan for tomorrow?" He just needs the plan.
 So I think he might have a shaper in there somewhere, but they're certainly...
 Yes, Abby too. Abby likes to plan.
 And they don't do great if the plan has changed. Do great. They don't do that well.
 But again, with two high, high shapers leading the pack, it's no one that they think that
 of biosmosis.
 Yeah, yes.
 But the good thing about that is, is I hear that they know there's a plan.
 If you're in a family where there's not a plan, that's dangerous.
 That doesn't feel good as a person.
 When the leaders lead, it feels comfortable and safe for the people that are in their
 organization or in a family, you know, mom's leading, dad's leading, somebody's leading,
 Somebody's got a good plan.
 Well, there's comfort and their safety.
 And there's the people that are in charge have a plan.
 Right.
 There's a shaper.
 I know that.
 Cause when you're in an organization where it feels like
 leadership is weak, that feels insecure.
 Yes.
 I've been in that situation as well.
 Where you're just like, what am I following?
 You're bringing security to your family
 by making a good plan.
 So they always go, they know there's going to be a good plan.
 when they go to bed at diet. I love that. There's a shaper. I love that.
 Any other conflict points that your professional eye is catching?
 No, you guys probably have very low cross talks. Based on this, you're probably somewhere in the
 teens or lower. We don't see your numbers, but the fact that you're top three of the same and
 your bottom one is the same, you've got a very low up. It's easy for you all to speak the same
 language. You're speaking about what's the plan. You're thinking about, "Am I interested? Are you
 doing your share?" Are you doing your share? Fairness is our biggest conflict point.
 Absolutely. It was the thing that came up in our healing week with the kill stress, our biggest
 thing was fairness. Yeah, okay. Absolutely.
 Well, the funny thing with the fairness thing was when I was when we went away and did our healing week
 Chester and Betsy our ministry people who were doing the ministry they would give me homework and I just thought that was normal
 Okay, I'd go home work side come home and I'd be like
 Did you get homework and they just like no they just told me I need to sleep more and of course
 My fair thing is like they told you what?
 all week and I was trying to get homework because I was aware this wasn't going to be a good scenario.
 And so I would say to them, like, "But Alan's doing homework. Do you want me to do homework?"
 I mean, he's reading this shame-fear control cycle. Do you want me to read that again?"
 You know, whatever. And they're like, "No, we just feel like the Lord just wants you to have a
 season with just having some rest." And you know, whatever. I'm like, "Okay." And I'm thinking,
 "This isn't going to be good." That was historically our thing.
 when we'd go for marriage counseling or we'd go for ministry,
 it would always be like, are you doing your share in ministry?
 Like how much of your heart are you bearing?
 Because I'm bearing my heart.
 So yeah, fairness is a thing.
 It's significantly better now than it was then, but it's still,
 you know, it's still appears.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 I think to worry about it.
 What are some resources that I see that you brought some books with you? What are some resources that would help people?
 I mean, obviously I'm going to say this with whole-heartedness and not just because you're on the show.
 You know, we have a track record, I think, if you listen to our podcast, we are all about people getting healing.
 But I also know because we have had friends, we have helped connect people from all over the world who've flown to Franklin, Tennessee
 to receive ministry from you guys.
 So I know that you minister to people all of the time.
 And I will say that the guys, no matter what state your marriage is in or no matter
 what state your life is in, you certainly don't need to be married to receive
 ministry from RTF.
 And also it's worth saying you don't need to fly to Franklin, Tennessee.
 There's RTF trained ministers all over the world.
 However, if you want the best, they're called Mike and Phyllis best for a reason.
 But you know, so yes, of course, book an appointment, come and get
 some ministry from these guys, it would be well worth the investment in your life and
 your marriage.
 Aside from that, we'll talk about how people can get in contact with you in a second.
 What are some resources that you would really recommend people would sink their teeth into?
 One of them is speaking of love, which is the book on life languages by Fred and Anna
 Kendall that we've been talking about so much.
 That book really goes in depth.
 When you take the profile, you get a lot of information already, but the book talks about
 just every aspect of the life language, even how they decorate their room, what they like
 to do on vacation, how they like sex.
 I mean, they go into every area.
 Another one is the Seven Love Agreements by Douglas Weiss.
 It's just basic tools that you can use to strengthen your marriage.
 And so every week or so you'll take one principle like patience and work on that and there's
 some specific exercises.
 So that's a real practical book that you can order.
 And the other one that we really love is 10 Lessons to Transform Your Marriage and it's
 by John Gottman.
 The Gottman's are premier marriage researchers and they just have practical tools for communication,
 for dealing with when you think that you're in a no-win situation and there absolutely
 is no answer to whatever situation you're in.
 And so it's just a really good, another really good book just for practical information.
 That's at sex and output links to all those resources in the show notes.
 The question that we want to leave you is, how do people get a hold of you?
 How do people want ministry from you?
 What is the best way for people to get hold of you?
 Probably the best way to get a hold of this is through email.
 We have two email addresses, maybe three, but our two top ones for ministry are <a href="mailto:Mike@bestmarriage.us">Mike@bestmarriage.us</a>
 Phyllis, P-H-L-L-I-S at bestmarriage.us.
 The third is RTF Nashville at gmail.com.
 I will put links to all of those in the show notes.
 What do people do?
 They just email you and say, "Hey, I heard you in the podcast.
 We'd love to talk to you about getting some ministering.
 They just pick up a conversation from there.
 Is that the best way?"
 Yeah, that would be fantastic.
 Say yes, we're interested in ministry.
 a phone number so we can give you a call and we can contact you and set something up.
 I'm not exaggerating when I've said that we've had people from outside the US from far away places
 come to receive ministry. It's really by word of mouth, isn't it, that people come,
 they have their marriage transformed, their life transformed, they go home and people are like,
 "What happened to you?" They're like, "Well, I met this couple in Franklin, Tennessee."
 and they're like, "Where?" Franklin, Tennessee. And of course, we've got great donuts. So you come,
 you get ministered to this tremendous coffee, great restaurant.
 Let's not forget the coffee donuts and acai bowls that are available here.
 That's worth the trip right there.
 Right there. Well, Mike and Phyllis, thank you so much for coming and being on the podcast and
 dropping your bombs of wisdom about marriage and all things interhealing. We really, really,
 They really appreciate it.
 Thanks for the impromptu cross talks.
 It's, you know, we'll work on those responder issues.
  </li><li>Thank you so much for having us.
 It's been a joy.
  </li><li>A wonderful evening.
  </li><li>If you want the show notes for this week's episode,
 you can get them at <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/149.
  </li><li>We'd also like to invite you to the more conference

 Speaking of events that are at Grace Center
 that are of the life-changing nature,
 our School of Supernatural Life,
 the school that we just graduated this week,
 we are now accepting applications
 and we would love you to come applications
 for the school this year, close June 15th.
 And we would love to spend the next eight months
 with you diving deeper into the word of God
 and watching the Holy Spirit transform your life.
  </li><li>I also wanna remind you, if you have done this school
 and you're thinking about year two
 that we'd also love to have you on that.
  </li><li>Oh, that would be great.
  </li><li>It would be very good.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
  </li><li>We love year two, it's very fun.
  </li><li>The book that Mike and Phyllis talked about
 saying had the most impact on them in recent years
 was Finding Father, written by the very good looking
 and wonderfully beautiful,
 AJ Jones sitting at the other end of this table for me.
  </li><li>Oh, thanks babe.
  </li><li>AJ's book is called Finding Father,
 it's a 12 week study guide.
 It is purposely written to lead you into greater intimacy with God.
 You can pick up your own copy too and have your own life changing identity statements
 by going to Allen and AJ.com.
 Scroll to the bottom.
 You'll see Finding Father There.
 Thanks once again to Mike and Phyllis and thank you dear listener for tuning in.
 We'll see you next week.
