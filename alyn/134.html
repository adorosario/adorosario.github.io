<p> I'm not sure i look tanned but you're cute.
 It's a very dim room.<br/>
 You look darker than normal.<br/>
 I should stand in dark rooms a lot.
</p><ul>
  <li>Well, I look refreshed probably because we're in Florida.
  </li><li>Greetings from sunny Florida,
 everybody where we spent the last four days?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Babe, I've just seen a wound on your leg.
 Is that from falling over while riding your bicycle today?
  </li><li>I was attacked by an alligator.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Had nothing to do with the fact that I lost my bounce
 and fell over on a bike.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Okay, it does, now that you mentioned it
 look like an alligator wound.
  </li><li>You should see the alligator.
 Wow.
 Right on the snout.
 That's what you're supposed to do.
 Alligators and sharks.
 Yep.
 It's the first thing that comes to mind when I see one coming towards me is I need to
 get closer and punch it on the snout.
 Okay, sorry.
 Thanks to the generosity, kindness, and help of many of our friends.
 Yes.
 We've managed to get away for four days.
 We did.
 Actually, it'll be five by the time we get home.
 Yeah.
 All without kids.
 It's so strange.
 Listen.
 Do you hear that? That's nothing. It's nobody saying, Mommy. It's nobody saying, Daddy.
 It all actually began with Jamie Galloway. He gave us a word, but you were there to hear
 it because I was at homesick. What? Where he basically said, God's about to give you
 some time away, just you two without the kids. And when our community heard that a bunch
 of our leaders and students on the school took up an offering for us to let us know
 and paid for us to go away. And organized babysitting while we were away.
 Amazing. Which is astonishing. So thank you everybody who made this happen.
 Yes, it's very, very kind of you. I can't remember the last time I felt this
 refreshed. Yeah, it's funny because, you know, we of course take the kids on vacation every year.
 we go somewhere by the closer.
 Well, apparently it's law that you need to,
 you can't just leave your kids at home.
 Yes, I heard that.
 Well, although, you know, I think as long as you leave them,
 like some water and some carrots, it should be fine.
 Box and matches.
 (laughs)
 But, we've never, or we haven't really gotten away,
 just the two of us.
 Well, we went to Iceland last year.
 But that was a ministry trip.
 It wasn't like to just hang out and enjoy each other.
 Oh, we enjoyed each other.
 Keep a PG, mister.
 Doing my best.
 OK.
 Before we talk about a PG version of what we've done,
 while we've been down here, we kept the week.
 You started the week, which feels like a long, long time ago
 in a galaxy far, far away, teaching on year two.
 You're teaching verse by verse through Romans.
 Yes.
 How did I go?
 I don't want really well, I think.
 Yeah, I mean, I love doing any of those weeks
 where we get to go verse by verse through
 and sort of talk about what does that mean, you know?
  </li><li>You really do.
  </li><li>How does that affect us, yeah?
  </li><li>That's one of your favorite things to do
 is a verse by verse Bible study.
  </li><li>Yeah, I love them.
  </li><li>Where did you learn that?
 I mean, where did you get your passion for doing that from?
  </li><li>I don't know.
 I mean, I remember doing the first one I ever did
 was with a group of young adults in Toronto.
 It was just a group of the leaders and stuff and friends,
 you know, I just said, "Hey, meet me at a coffee store."
 And if you want to study Ephesians with me,
 and there was, I don't know, 15 or 18 of them
 that showed up at a Williams Coffee store.
 And we sat there and we,
 for over a couple of weeks, studied Ephesians together.
 We looked into all the history and everything
 so that we could understand what was going on
 as we read through Ephesians.
  </li><li>Very good.
  </li><li>Yeah, and I just loved it, I don't know.
  </li><li>My father would be very proud of you.
  </li><li>Thank you.
 And you spoke, of course,
 a lemonade on Monday night.
 Yeah, so for someone who's spoken, feels like forever.
 Yeah, it's been quite a while.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, and you spoke on blessings, didn't you?
 I did.
 I've been thinking about this whole topic of blessing only
 because every time I come to be with a Lord,
 all he speaks to me about is blessing.
 Yeah.
 And I realized I had a whole lot of internal structures,
 like pre-existing negative thoughts regarding blessing.
 Right.
 And so we basically explored some of that.
 I'm going to do some more teaching on it in a few days.
 I'm really excited about that.
 I know pushed a bunch of people's buttons from post that I saw on social media where people were saying,
 "Hey, this pushed my button." But then God said this, you know, kind of thing. So it's quite fun.
 It's funny because it pushed all my buttons.
 So I feel like as a speaker, whenever God's pushing my buttons, I like to share the pain.
 Well, that's so kind of you.
 Well, you know what? I love to give.
 So that was Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, we jumped on the corn drove here.
 Yeah.
 Tell me your top three favorite things about being here.
 Riding bikes with you.
 Yes, riding bikes has featured a lot.
 Yes.
 Welcome to that in a second.
 Seafood?
 Yes.
 A great place to get good seafood is right next to the ocean.
 I've eaten an enormous amount of seafood.
 And I think just getting to explore, because we've been down this way a couple times,
 but always with the kids.
 And the kids really don't want to walk in and out of little stores or little art shops or
 see where the street goes or any of that kind of stuff.
 So I've really enjoyed the walking around and finding things.
 I found a cute little chapel and stuff like that.
 So that's it has fed me.
 Yeah.
 What about your three?
 The bikes.
 We got some bikes for Christmas last year, didn't we?
 Yes.
 We haven't used them much, really.
 We haven't used them as much as we'd like to.
 Right.
 And so you said, let's bring our bikes.
 And we dumped them in the back of the car.
 And I'm glad we brought them because in the first day,
 we realized our minivan had a flat tire.
 And so we couldn't go anywhere.
 And so our bikes came in hand days.
 we cycle 20 miles to pick a wrench to get the old tire off and put anyone long story we won't go into.
 But I have actively found tremendous joy being in the outdoors.
 I know it's a shock. Jesus is returning. Somebody may need to give oxygen to anybody that really
 knows Alan that's listening to the podcast right now. Look around you, take a deep breath. You're okay.
 But here's the thing, I realized, Florida in January is completely different than Florida in July.
 Wow, babe, that's very astute of you.
 Like this climate, for me, is the perfect climate.
 It's like 72 degrees.
 There's about 70% humidity, which is totally fine, which means it's absolutely warm enough to go out short T-shirts.
 And you just don't die, whereas in July, you're just like, oh my gosh.
 I'd like to meet halfway in the middle.
 I'd like a little warmer than it is, but I'd like it 10 or 15 degrees warmer.
 Right.
 You can have that, but you didn't get it.
 I know.
 So being out in that beautiful climate and then being out in a bike, and here's
 what I like about a bike is, yes, it's inherently analog, but I like partnering
 mechanically, like very little effort produces tremendous reward.
 Like you can cycle way faster than you can walk.
 And for me, it feels like less effort than walking.
 Yes.
 Like if we'd walked 10 miles, I would be more
 uncomfortable than cycling 10 miles.
 Well, yes, of course.
 Yes.
 And you can go those 10 miles much faster with much less effort.
 Yes.
 And I, you know, without sounding too ridiculous, I have absolutely
 loved being outdoors.
 I have loved it.
 It helps that they have a big cycle path.
 There's a big 20 mile cycle path that you can do from one end of a third
 which is the main road down here to the other.
 And it is absolutely gorgeous.
  </li><li>It really is beautiful, yeah.
  </li><li>In the shade most of the time.
 So there's forests on either side.
 And then there's little breaks where you get to see
 the ocean and then there's sand.
 And I mean, it is absolutely gorgeous,
 blue skies, we would get up early, ish.
 And we would go for a bike ride to go get breakfast.
  </li><li>We didn't get up early, ish, we got up early.
 We're away and we don't have any children and we're still getting up just before seven.
 I know, but we normally get up at five thirty, so it feels like a lion for me.
 No, a lion has got to be at least eight or nine.
 Nevertheless, it has been very nice getting up, getting on our bikes, cycling for breakfast,
 cycling somewhere else, having lunch, cycling somewhere else.
 Exploring.
 I've absolutely loved it.
 I've loved me and you being together, cycling, getting some exercise.
 Apparently these things called endorphins that are released after you exercise.
 Yes.
 And I may have found an exercise I actually like.
 What a thought.
 Now we just have to find bike paths in Franklin for you.
 Well, here's the other thing.
 It's totally flat here.
 There's no incline or decline.
 That's true.
 It's very easy to bike.
 So you can cycle 20 miles and it's pretty much flat the whole time.
 Yes.
 Anyway, number one, biking absolutely loved it.
 Number two, of course, the food.
 We've eaten like kings love it.
 Yes.
 And then I've really enjoyed that I have sort of staying in and just the peace and the quiet and the stillness.
 Yeah, it's really lovely.
 Did you like me beating you at Monopoly deal at lunch?
 I don't remember you beating me.
 Yes, you do.
 I absolutely trounced you.
 I have picture proof.
 I could post it to Instagram if you like.
 Oh, I remember that was the game before I absolutely trounced you.
 Yes, that's right.
 You barely trounced me.
 You don't even know how you trounced me because I was so far ahead.
 you just fluke picked up two cards and that was it.
 Maybe I fluke picked them up or maybe God was good and thought that you needed humbling.
 That can't be right.
 We've had more time than we'd imagine on our hands, so we went to the movie theater.
 We did. We went twice.
 What movie were you super excited to see?
 Well, I was super excited to see La La Land.
 And what was my thoughts about La La Land before we went to see it?
 You weren't thrilled with the idea.
 No, we bordered quite considerably.
 Yes.
 You get me to go and see there.
 Yes.
 And then what was your take on the movie?
 I'm sad to say I didn't like it.
 Which is odd because you love musicals.
 And really musicals are like my favorite kind of movie.
 Are they really?
 I love musicals.
 You're a strange individual.
 Well, thank you.
 I did not know that.
 Yeah, I really love them.
 Really?
 Yeah.
 And I don't, I just didn't drink the Kool-Aid with La La Land.
 I don't, I don't, I don't get it.
 I left.
 I got so bored.
 Well, there was a fair amount of distraction while we were watching it as well.
 Well, that's the unique part about going to a movie theater in an afternoon, Matt, and
 a in Florida.
 It tends to be filled with really old people.
 Like everybody had white hair in the whole theater.
 And who talk all the way through it.
 Yes.
 And the Holy Spirit said to me, "I'd really like you to honor your elders."
 So I didn't do my normal thing, which is what I normally do.
 If I'm in a movie theater and you're talking, I will confront you because it's just rude.
 true. But I didn't. I fell out of the hoist person. No, do you just honor your elders?
 But there was one lady off to your left that was basically explaining everything to her husband
 as it was happening. And when she wasn't talking, she was having great difficulty unwrapping
 words, you know, originals. She's so loud too. I'm not sure if maybe her husband couldn't hear.
 Well, he asked enough questions. He did. I left and just watched YouTube until you were done.
 And I actually considered leaving when you left, which for me is very strange, but I did to the end and then I was just aggravated.
 Yeah, I would love it genuinely because lots of our friends have really loved a movie.
 I would love you to explain to me what you loved about it.
 I'd really love, honestly, I'd love to hear your perspectives on it.
 Yeah, I don't get it.
 But I did not enjoy the movie.
 But then we also went and saw hidden treasures.
 Nope.
 No hidden people.
 -I didn't. -Figors.
 -Figors. -Yes.
 -Which was amazing. Love that movie.
 -So good. -I just realized,
 Kevin Cossner is one of my favorite actors.
 -I really like him too. He did a great job in that movie.
 -But he was kind of a supporting role. -Kind of.
 -The main actresses, they stole the story.
 -Yes. I love it. -I mean, it was such a great movie. Go see it.
 -Did you cry? -I did.
 -So did I. -Yes.
 -All right. Well, so the reason that we're in Florida is,
 tomorrow we celebrate our 12-year wedding anniversary.
  </li><li>12 years, baby.
  </li><li>I know we've talked about marriage
 and relationships before in the podcast,
 but let's face facts.
 We've pretty much talked about everything we know
 about on the podcast, so now we're repeating ourselves.
 (laughing)
 I'm fine with.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So we're gonna talk about marriage.
 We, by no means, are experts.
 We've only been married 12 years.
 There's lots of people who listen to this podcast
 who've been married way longer than that.
  </li><li>They do.
  </li><li>And there's lots of people who are
 maybe tempted to skip this episode because you're like, well, you know, I'm not married.
 So why do I care about this?
 But I will tell you, it won't be very long because we're still on our vacation.
 So we're going to go watch a movie.
 Oh, you mean the podcast?
 What would we? Yeah.
 So if you're thinking they won't be single for very long, no, no, I mean,
 if you're thinking of skipping the podcast, because we just said marriage,
 you know, we're not going to talk for like another half an hour on marriage or anything like that.
 I thought you were giving like the boldest prophetic.
 If you're single, it won't be long.
 [laughter]
 Take that.
 Take it.
 There it is.
 There it is.
 So let's talk about our marriage.
 Let's talk about marriage in general.
 Let's talk about our marriage.
 Okay.
 Tell me some surprising things about being married to me.
 What were some things after 12 years have surprised you?
 It surprised me that you liked bike riding as much as you did this trip.
 Honestly, I'm like, I haven't been able to get you to go outside.
 I didn't 12 years.
 And all of a sudden you're like, "Let's go for a bike ride.
 Let's go for another bike ride."
 bike ride. I want a bike ride back from over here. Babe, that's 10 miles. That's fine. I'll see you
 at home. I'm like, who are you? We did go for a bike ride through a national park, which was a
 bit of a mistake. It was a mistake because our bikes are not really like mountain bikes. No. So
 every tree stump, which there was tons of was like jarring. This is a trail through a forest.
 Yeah, it's not good, which was not friendly. No. So we didn't make that that long. We tried. We
 We went half a mile in before we hit like a massive patch of sand and I almost wiped
 out and I said, I'm done.
 You did.
 Turn around.
 You were not happy.
 I was not happy.
 No.
 No.
 So you were surprised about me going to the set.
 I suppose I am surprised because I've known you, what, 13 years in marriage for 12.
 I'm still surprised at your long suffering nature.
 It hasn't felt like, and all the years I've known you,
 and I know there's things I must do that drive you nuts.
 Wait, wait.
 No, seriously, there must be stuff that drives you nuts.
 And it doesn't feel like your grace has lifted for that.
 Well, I just think that you're incredibly patient with me,
 and I really appreciate that.
 Thanks.
 So not being funny, but what's the other option?
 Am I just gonna spend my life grumpy or snapping at you?
 Or like, what's the alternative?
 I've seen lots of people in marriages who haven't chosen your choice.
 So I've seen lots of people who do grumble or do complain or do criticize or do
 nag, right?
 But you are very, very patient and very, very kind.
 And you don't even do the thing that I do.
 I, I try to find an equivalent.
 So if there's something that's bothering me, I'm quite verbose in explaining to
 it.
 Major, here's why your behavior is bothering me.
 And in those moments, you don't like, Oh, is that so?
 Well, let me point out all the things you don't, you don't do that.
 you're like, "Well babe, thanks for sharing that with me."
 And I feel like one of the traits
 that you've always done in our marriage is
 you tend to know what's gonna happen
 a little sooner than I do, right?
 Maybe it's your prophetic nature.
  </li><li>Oh, you mean like stuff like moving
 or all that kind of stuff?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>The point I'm making is in the same way
 that you are patient and non-manipulative,
 in the same way that you are not frustrated
 that you're on a different time scale than I am.
 So for example, the Lord may have already told you
 that X is gonna happen and you don't get frustrated
 with me that I haven't yet realized that X is gonna happen.
 You don't try and push X as an agenda.
 You just say to the Lord, well, Lord, if X is gonna happen,
 I trust you to tell Alan and typically I come to you maybe
 about six to 12 months later and go,
 "Hmm, I think X is gonna happen.
 "You don't rub it in my face.
 "You don't go, are you kidding?
 "Maybe I'm waiting for that forever."
 You're just like, okay.
 So in the same way that you're gracious in that prophetic sense,
 I also feel like you're gracious with me
 with the things that may frustrate you
 about my character or my behavior.
 You are not demanding that I get fixed
 or changed on your timetable.
 You're quite willing for God to work on me to get there.
 And then when I do go,
 "Hey babe, I've just realized this is an issue in my life."
 You're not like, "Are you kidding me?
 I've been telling you that for years."
 You're very great.
 And I love that.
 It creates a very, very safe environment for me to not be scared to bring my heart to you
 with stuff that I'm struggling with.
 Oh, that's awesome.
 I mean, I don't think you can strictly say that that's completely true 100% of the time.
 I mean, I sound like I should be covered in gold leaf or something because I know that
 there's definitely been times where you read something in a book where it says, "Hey,
 babe, women don't like this."
 And I'm like, "Yes, I've been telling you that for 12 years."
 You know kind of thing.
 I mean, I like the accolades.
 I'd like to even be better at that.
 I think.
 But I just mean, as a general rule of thumb,
 like you've got so many of those going in your favorite.
 Sure, there's a few times when you're highly unreasonable
 and not as patient as frankly, I think you should be.
 Right.
 But they're very, very few.
 Thanks, babe.
 That's very sweet.
 And I love that.
 I see that in your mothering as well with the kids,
 where you're, you know, you're quite good at talking me down, going, babe.
 to four year old. This is what they're like. And I'm like, oh, yeah, that's right. So yeah, I've
 loved that. What has been one of your favorite things about being married to me? I've done
 surprising doing favorite.
 I think really, like I know everybody says, Oh, I married my best friend. But I think that's
 really been my favorite thing is that I think because we view life quite similarly and not
 everything. But, you know, we have similar values, similar goals, similar outlook on what
 different things mean. Do you know what I mean? So, I think just that MIF is very easy
 with you. Like, it's just, it's literally like hanging out with your best friend.
 Right. But in the same pushback that you did, like, I mean, I think about last week, last
 week was not very easy with me. Last week we had a huge, it doesn't seem huge now in
 retrospect, but at the moment it was super huge. Yeah. A huge disconnect. Yeah. We'll talk
 about that in a second. But that's so rare, babe. Right. It is rare. But I'm... So I can't,
 I mean, the last time that that happened, what? Several years before? I mean, it's so rare
 that we have, I mean, that was a couple of days, but so rare that we have that. Right.
 true. Anyway, I'm not going to argue out of you thinking I'm brilliant. So yes, okay.
 So your favorite thing is me being brilliant. Yes, I agree.
 What about you, babe? Sex. Okay. What was what we were answering your favorite thing.
 Okay. Well, that's brilliant. Thanks for your honesty.
 And he says, you know, when talking about love languages, he's the same love languages.
 Me physical touch and words of affirmation. So he quips basically, I want my wife to lie on
 top of me and tell me I'm amazing. I would agree.
 We can do that later.
 Yes. What's been some of the challenging things about being married to me?
 Challenging things about being married to you. What's been some of the challenging things
 about being married to me?
 Challenging things. I would say one of the challenging things about being married to
 you is that we're both quite, well, we're both leaders. So this happens rarely, but there
 are times when we both have a direction and it might be different from the other person.
 Yeah. As in, I might feel like the Lord has said, we're going to go do this and you might
 not agree with that or vice versa. Right.
 And I think the way that we've dealt with that, I really like that unless there's unity
 between the two of us, we don't go. And so I like that. Everyone loves to say, "Scripture
 says why I submit to your husbands." So I could play the card of, "Babe, it says in
 the Bible, you're supposed to submit to me. I think we should be going this way." And
 they're, but we've never led like that because Scripture says submit yourselves therefore
 one to another. And wisdom is always spoken about in the feminine form.
 So I can't think of a time where it has not helped us to wait until both of us have heard from the Lord about something.
 Yeah, I totally agree.
 But in the moment while you're waiting is for strength.
 Yes, it can be.
 It can be.
 But again, in hindsight, I've realized it has been quite beneficial.
 So that was what I've found challenging.
 What have you found challenging?
  </li><li>Well, no, I would agree with that.
 I mean, I can't really think of much
 that's been that challenging, babe.
  </li><li>How about having all this eye candy
 constantly in front of you?
  </li><li>It's so hard, you're right.
 But somehow I managed to do it.
 Pasty white, it's got our skin, it's just--
  </li><li>All right.
 One of the greatest blessings we ever had in being married
 was we lived with John and Carol.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So for those of us who don't know,
 maybe we should start us in the podcast.
 When we got married, we lived with our spiritual parents.
 They had a large enough house
 that they had a downstairs apartment
 that was completely separate from their house.
 But it was hugely beneficial to live
 with an older married couple
 who basically left us to our own devices.
 But it's very hard to argue in a house
 that you're sharing with somebody else.
 So whenever that would happen,
 they would always be like, "You need to talk?"
 Or just being able to have a safe mom and dad
 to come upstairs and say, "Hey, we're having this trouble
 "or that trouble."
  </li><li>Can you help us sort it out?
  </li><li>And that was incredibly helpful.
 We are now in a stage of life
 where we've been married for over 10 years
 and a lot of the people that we lead
 or have either just got married or about to get married,
 what are some of the things that you would encourage people
 who have just got married or are
 in the early stages of their marriage?
 Think back to what John and Carol taught us,
 what did we find helpful?
 What would be some things that you would wanna share?
  </li><li>I think it would be good to learn to extend grace.
 And I think it's too easy,
 especially if you're getting married sort of later in life,
 like late 20s or 30s where you're kind of established in a sense of how you view life
 and all that kind of stuff.
 I think it would be good to really remember that the way you view life isn't the only
 way to view it and to extend grace.
 That's a shocking revelation, isn't it?
 Well, yeah.
 I'm just thinking like often we can think and I remember this happened a lot more when
 when we were first married,
 where because of how I view the world
 for you to be doing what you are doing
 must be that you're just an ignorant jerk,
 where you're like, no, I'm doing it this way
 because this is the right way to do it
 and there's no maliciousness in it.
 This is how I do X, you know.
  </li><li>Right, basically you're saying
 you would watch behavior in me.
 Let's use an example.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I might get up in the morning,
 I might go make myself some cornflakes, eat a bowl of cereal,
 put the bowl down beside my chair, get on to do some work,
 and then maybe leave for the day, come back,
 not be aware that the breakfast cereal bowl is there,
 and you will come home and you're thinking,
 for me to leave that breakfast bowl there,
 I would have to go through this thought process.
 I could pick up my breakfast bowl,
 but screw it, Alan can do it later when he gets home.
  </li><li>Right.
 it would never occur to you to be that untidy.
  </li><li>Right, so then you assign in your mind
 a maliciousness that isn't there,
 a motive that isn't there.
 And it doesn't just, it doesn't have to be,
 you realize you can be doing it
 in little ways all the way throughout the day.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And then, but actually what you're doing
 is forming tiny little judgments about the person
 that you're trying to fall in love with.
 And that's counterintuitive, right?
 Yeah.
 You know, it's just--
 It's counterproductive.
 So your definition then of extending grace
 would be practice believing the best,
 rather than having confidence in your estimation
 of what's actually going on with their motives.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 That's hard.
 I would say the-- and we've said this before.
 We did a whole podcast episode and I'll put a link
 on the show notes that your connection
 is the most important thing in all your relationships.
 If we wanna come to marriage, your connection,
 your rich, real, vibrant heart-to-heart connection
 is the most important thing in your marriage.
 And when you leave that connection to suffer,
 the quality of everything else you're trying to do suffers.
 As in when your connection is really, really good,
 everything else becomes easier.
 It's easier to extend grace.
 It's easier to have patients.
 It's easier to be bearing with one another.
 But when your connection begins to deteriorate, everything suffers.
 Totally agree.
 And that's what happened to us last week.
 We had a...
 We had...
 I forget what the events were leading up to last week.
 But...
 I just started with a discussion where I totally missed you and you totally missed me.
 Yes, but what I'm saying is on any other given day, we have plenty of discussions like
 that.
 And if we miss each other, no big deal.
 We will say...
  </li><li>I'm just kind of around.
  </li><li>But I think because the previous weeks
 have been quite busy,
 we, our love languages,
 our love tanks were fairly empty.
 Our connection was beginning to suffer.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So we have this conversation where I totally
 mishear what you're saying, my heart gets hurt.
 I then, and it's so funny 'cause I was teaching
 in the school on the very thing I needed to practice,
 stuck at the back of my brain, unable to practice
 anything I absolutely know.
 And because of the pain I feel I disconnect from you.
  </li><li>Right, right.
  </li><li>Which, as you could imagine, doesn't help
 strengthen the connection when one party is retreating.
  </li><li>Correct.
  </li><li>But I would say if our love tanks were fuller,
 that wouldn't be a disconnect.
 That would be a, hey babe, earlier at breakfast
 when you said that thing, should my heart got really hurt?
  </li><li>Right, which is how it normally gets resolved.
  </li><li>How it normally goes.
  </li><li>Yeah, what about Chip Judd's thing about make your marriage
 about who can out serve one another?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I thought that piece of advice when I heard him give it
 was like, oh, that's a game changer.
 Like if you can actually do that.
  </li><li>But see that, that piece of advice only works well
 if you already have a fairly robust connection.
 If our connection is deteriorating,
 then I have got no motivation or little motivation
 to out serve you because I'm already feeling
 you're stealing from me.
 And then we go into preservation of self
 rather than sacrifice of self.
  </li><li>Right, or it becomes,
 oh, I'll stink and serve you, all right?
 (laughs)
  </li><li>You will be loved.
  </li><li>You will be loved.
  </li><li>And now I'm mentally keeping a scorecard
 of all the reasons you should love them
 because I'm serving you and you haven't even noticed.
 And then we go into martyrdom
 and that just severs the connection.
  </li><li>And we'll have fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.
  </li><li>We will have fun at all.
 When we were taught by connection,
 connection is strengthened by speaking love
 to one another and this whole topic of love languages
 comes up.
 What are your love languages?
  </li><li>Well, we did the test about a year ago
 and they are gifts and acts of service are my top
 and then quality time and then like way low
 is physical touch and words of affirmation.
  </li><li>All right, coincidentally enough,
 my top two as previously have been mentioned
 or what's of affirmation and quality touch.
  </li><li>Physical touch.
  </li><li>Physical touch.
 (laughing)
 Right.
 (laughing)
 So you could see if we don't put any effort
 into communicating love to one another,
 our connection is gonna degrade pretty quickly.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Because I'm saying, "Hey babe, you're amazing,
 "you're amazing, you're amazing."
 But you're like, "Screw that, serve me, buy me a gift."
 And I'm like, "Oh my gosh, what's wrong with you?
 "Look, I'm loving you."
  </li><li>Yes.
 I'm giving you. I don't want to be touched. Take the garbage out. We had to navigate that
 little puppy. That's an ongoing choosing intentionally to speak the languages that are your lowest.
 That requires tremendous bravery. One of the things I think that you do really well
 is you display tremendous courage when you revisit the emotional places that you were hurt.
 Let me give you an example. Okay, because I don't know what you're talking about.
 So we'll have a conversation. I'll misread something that you've just said, and I'll get hurt.
 And ordinarily, on any given day, the environment that you just got hurt in is me perhaps snapping
 you because I felt hurt or misunderstood. So I'll snap at you, and you will take a step back,
 because nobody likes being snapped at. What is normal for you? What is most like you is you will
 go away and you will think, "Ha, that isn't the Allen's behavior there. Isn't like the
 behavior I know that Allen is normally like." And so you will revisit the place, you will come back
 and you will try and reconnect. "Hey, babe, I realized there was something just missed. I realized
 that your heart got really hurt and I just wanted to revisit. Can you tell me what you were thinking
 when I said X. And because of your bravery of coming back where most people would run
 away because I just snapped at you. Why would you want to go back to the place you were
 just snapped up? You'll come back and say, Hey, I feel like you might have misunderstood.
 Can you tell me what's going on? Your bravery causes me to go. Okay, I'm going to trust
 you. I'm going to trust that you're not here to trap me. Here's what my heart felt. And
 then you will be like, babe, no, no, I didn't mean that at all. I'm so sorry. And because
 your bravery, it gets rewarded with a reconnection. I think you're amazing at that. I think you do
 a great job of that. Thanks, babe. I think, though, too, the reason that I can do that is because
 you are easy to come and talk to and you display humility in that I can sit down and have that
 kind of conversation with you, and it's safe for me to revisit it. It's pretty rare that you do this
 snapping thing. And if it does happen, it's pretty easy to sit down and go, "Hey, this
 isn't like you because it isn't like you. And so I know that I've hurt you. And can we
 talk about that?"
 Right. But I think both your courage and my humility, which seems weird to say, but both
 those things go hand-in-hand, the courage and humility go hand-in-hand. And when we've
 been doing marriage counseling with people, either the courage is there and the humility
 isn't, so the person who's exercising bravery and coming back quickly learns this is not
 worth it. Or the courage isn't there, and so both parties just go away and sulk and
 feel disconnected. Which, to be honest, is what happened to us last week. We both got
 our hearts hurt and realized, but then the good thing is pain is there to push you back
 towards each other. Like we felt the pain of disconnection and we're like, "Can we
  </li><li>Right, well neither one of us wants to live like that.
  </li><li>No, not at all.
  </li><li>I think too, staying in that place,
 then you just start to harbor bitterness
 and you start to build a case against the person
 that you're supposed to be in love with.
  </li><li>And when you're doing that,
 that is a sure sign that your connection has degraded.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And now your relationship is suffering.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And honestly, the whole thing of preferring one another
 goes out the window at that point.
 now it's just fight for what you can get.
 Yeah. Or you just shut down. Just go numb.
 Oh, horrible.
 Right.
 Well, that was a cheery thing to talk about on our anniversary.
 Yeah.
 The thing is, it's not the way any of us want to live, is it?
 No, Anne, but well, here's the cheater part.
 We hardly ever lived like that.
 Right.
 But we were modeled that from John and Carol.
 Yeah.
 They taught us that.
 They would consistently call us back to who God saw us as like, "Okay, Alan, you
 behaving like that?
 Has that produced a fruit that you want in your relationship?"
 No, it hasn't.
 Well, would you consider?
 I think the other thing that God did early on for us is he would never take our side.
 That's true.
 Like when we'd have an argument...
 Well, you know, I didn't want to tell you this, but sometimes he did take my side.
 Never.
 But we would have a fight.
 Yeah.
 I'd go away.
 I'd complain about you.
 speak to be about me. And he wouldn't say, yeah, you're right.
 She's like, God, why are we talking about me? And he's like,
 because I don't hold you accountable for her behavior. I hold you accountable for yours.
 Yeah. And so he'd only ever taught me about my side of stuff.
 So yeah, he's good like that. Before we end. Yes. Misconceptions about marriage.
 Misconceptions about marriage. I don't know. I don't know, babe. I don't know if I had any
 misconceptions about marriage. What are you thinking? Well, I can think of two.
 Okay. I can think of one misconception is when you're not married and you're
 imagining what married life is going to be like, it never takes into consideration
 other people's version of marriage. So when I was thinking about what was going
 to be like married to you, they're doing the fact or anything that you might have
 opinions. Awesome. Okay. Well obviously we're going to get married and we're
 going to have sex all day. That's what married life looks like. That's what
 every female dreams of as well.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>But you know, I just,
 I throw that as one example.
  </li><li>Right, where I gotcha, I gotcha.
  </li><li>Or anything, like obviously when we're married,
 we'll just adopt the roles that my parents had.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And you're not even conscious that you're doing that.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>But your future version doesn't take into consideration
 other people's version of your future.
  </li><li>Right, and you have a different set of normals,
 and the person you're marrying has a different set of normals,
 which will have largely contributed
 to what you think marriage is about and what it's going to look like.
 Right. And so that's a fun one to navigate.
 The second misconception, which we did, was it Patricia King who told us this? Somebody told us this,
 but you know how everybody says, "Oh, the first year marriage is the hardest."
 You know, that's a thing that people say. Yeah, that's definitely a thing.
 For me, that's the misconception that we never bought into.
 No, we didn't buy into it at all. And I forget who told us that, that it doesn't have to be.
 Well, I mean, Patricia, the day before, uh, the day before the wedding, because she couldn't
 stay for the wedding, she said, you know, she
 as only Patricia can she was like, well, I saw the wedding tomorrow and the presence of God is
 going to be there. And she said, you need to know that the Lord is just going to bless your
 marriage. And it's not going to be, you know, the first year is the hardest or any of those
 things is just the Lord is going to show up on your behalf.
 And you know, and it's interesting because I think we'd had that discussion with John
 and Carol as well, like not to partner with negative expectations.
 And we'd done a lot of trying to deal with anything that had already come to the surface
 in terms of relationship stuff so that it wasn't as rocky a road.
 But yeah, that was not our experience.
 The first year wasn't difficult.
 And the second year wasn't difficult.
 The third year, you know, it wasn't right.
 It's just it's not been difficult.
 It's work.
 Of course it is.
 It's intention.
 Right.
 Because right.
 Exactly being intentional with another person is work, but it's not hard work.
 Well, it's like this.
 You know, on your Saturday and you're exhausted from the week and all you want to do
 is stay in your pajamas and have a nap.
 Be cereal, watch Netflix and have a nap.
 Yes.
 That's not hard work.
 That's getting to do what you want without any other people.
 Right.
 But that's not work. Going to work Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, that takes effort you get up,
 you put on clothes, you go out. That's kind of what marriage is like. It requires intentional
 effort. But I love it. Yeah. It's good. Good. Good. Thank you for being married to me for 12
 years. Oh, you're so welcome. I love you very much. I love you very much. I love you too.
 All right. Let's wrap this thing up. All right.
 You got a new book in the mail this week. Do you want to talk about it? I did. Yeah, I
 I contributed to a book that Patricia King put together on family.
 And what was your chapter about?
 My chapter was about normals.
 Yeah.
 The whole thing of you all go up with your own normals.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Have fun when you get married.
 That kind of thing.
 So a lot of what we were talking about just now.
 So that's, um, I am chapter one actually in her book, which is quite funny.
 All right.
 Very good.
 If people want to get a copy of that, we're going to get it from.
 Uh, they can get it from our bookstore.
 Oh, our bookstore, Alan, aj.
 Dot com.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Well, hold on.
 Cause we haven't actually uploaded that to our website.
 Okay.
 Well, sometime in the next couple of weeks, we'll be there.
 At some point, we'll upload it and you can get it, but you can probably get it at Amazon or
 Patricia's website and we'll let you know once we've got uploaded.
 We've got two events coming up next weekend, next Saturday, January 21st.
 I am going to be ministering with my good friend, Lyle Phillips, his parents' church,
 Legacy, Owensboro.
 We're doing a one-day event.
 I'm going to be teaching on boundaries.
 Lyle is going to be teaching on something amazing.
 And then Hunter Thompson from Bethel is going to be leaving worship.
 It's going to be a great day.
 Wow.
 That sounds great.
 And so, yeah, it's going to be a boundaries intensive.
 So if you're near Owensboro, Kentucky, I'll put link in the show notes for you to find
 more information about that event.
 And then you're doing something in February.
 Where are you?
 I am in Maricopa, Arizona.
 I think that's just outside of Phoenix.
 Right.
 Again, with Patricia King doing a father heart conference, I think they've called it "experiencing
 the father."
 And it's 12 sessions on the father heart of God.
 So it'll be really fun.
 All right, very good.
 Well, thank you for joining us.
 We record this from a makeshift podcast studio in the house that we're staying.
 We're surrounded by cushions to try and make it sound acoustically good.
 Mm-hmm.
 Hopefully it worked.
 We'll hear how it turns out once we edit this bad boy.
 So thank you for joining us.
 We pray blessing on your marriage if you're married.
 And if you're not, we pray very soon you will be.
 Amen.
