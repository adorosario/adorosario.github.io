<p> Hey sexy lady.<br/>
 No, we're not singing on this podcast anymore.
 I'm pretty sure that only applies to Canadians.
 No, you've been strictly banned. I'm sorry about that.
 How are you doing?<br/>
 I'm good.<br/>
 We've had, I was going to say we've had better weeks, but we've actually had quite good week.
 Mard only by the tail end of this week.
 Yeah, yesterday wasn't awesome for the last two days, but.
 Yeah, your back went out.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 I got sick.<br/>
 Yes. And we had a snow day so the kids were home.
 Yes. But the good thing about me being sick is my voice sounds awesome right now.
 Let's get. I could lower it.<br/>
 But this I actually can't.<br/>
 Don't do it. As it goes.<br/>
 It's my mark to bond impersonation.<br/>
 Very nice. There's glory. There it is.
 You know, he probably knows I just said that.
 Probably. Yeah.<br/>
 Let's talk about happy things of this week.
 Okay, paleo donuts.<br/>
 Paleo donuts.<br/>
 And like all great inventions, it was derived from great need.
 It was.<br/>
 See, Stephanie and Isaac Meek went on vacation.
 How dare they?<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 And left Nashville.<br/>
 Donutless.<br/>
 Well, what actually happened was Cindy was craving donuts.
 The thing I love about Cindy is there's many things I love about Cindy.
 But one is her absolute passion and excitement about whatever food that you are thinking
 of creating. I think she's passionate and excited about just about everything. Yeah, she is the
 swing vote for everything in life. Yes, it's true. It's true. So she went looking for donuts,
 couldn't find donuts because of course the mix is around vacation. And she texted me her dilemma
 at which point I said, if you find a donut pan, I will make you donuts. Just like that.
 I said it. And then I realized I'd never made donuts before. Well, that's why I was thinking.
 but what's on our way from Amazon right now donut fans but she found mini donut pants so i made
 mini donuts from the against all green good book and so there's no flour in them none and there's
 no dairy no and so what is it i'm eating when i put those delicious morsels in my mouth um
 almond flour, coconut flour, eggs,<br/>
 pureed pumpkin, honey,<br/>
 honey, you ate a whole bunch of them.<br/>
 So you can't say bleh.<br/>
 No, no, no, what I'm saying is the individual ingredients, no one says dangers,
 you know what I can do with this, a bowl of almond flour.
 Nobody thinks that they turned out great.
 No, no, no, no, no.<br/>
 You keep interacting the point of trying to make the point is, yes, they're
 absolutely delightful.<br/>
 my birth faces. How does a mixture of the turn into something awesome? That was my point.
 Skills. It scales to pay the bills. Well, you don't actually, we should start selling them.
 No. Let's start a paleo donut turf war with the meeks.
 No, I like their donuts much better than what I created.
 Yeah, that's true. But mine will pass until they get back.
 Yeah. You know what else I've got addicted to?
 But you know how everybody's like, man, I need my coffee, I need my coffee, and not being a
 coffee drinker, I've never had that problem. But you took me to Franklin juice a couple of days ago
 and introduced me to acai bowls. Now, I'm not even sure I'm saying acai right.
 I don't know. But it's that berry from Brazil. Yeah. And so it's basically goodness. Yeah, it's
 just frozen acai berries blended with stuff with whatever you wanted. And so I have the
 the julio named after julio, which has got I don't know bananas and apparently it's
 the most traditional Brazilian acai bowl. My point is you introduced me to it on whatever
 day the week it was. And that's all I was craving this week. I know. So I'm now scheduling
 all my meetings at Franklin's. I know. I totally I'm totally with you on that.
 So yes, that was a great start the week and end of the week we had a acai bowl yesterday.
 We did.<br/>
 I don't want to press you, but I want to briefly mention Champions Road.
 Who?<br/>
 The, we level have been playing.<br/>
 That's what it's called.<br/>
 Champions Road.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Hold it this day for a second.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 I just wanted, I didn't know there was a name for my torture.
 It's called Champions Road.<br/>
 You're spilling valuable airtime.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Shh.<br/>
 I got on a torch you but I do want to briefly mention champions road why.
 Because it is my mission at the moment.
 Well that's very sad.<br/>
 Do you want to tell the people what champions road is?
 No.<br/>
 Oh come on I want them to hear it in your words of honor.
 It is the most obnoxious game ever that never ends.
 It's the never ending Mario 3D World game.
 No.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 So what happens is when you finish Mario,
 Super Mario 3D World, which was the mission.
 I just got to finish this paper.<br/>
 I'm going to have the whole game finished.
 As soon as you do, it opens up a whole new game.
</p><ul>
  <li>No, no, no.
  </li><li>And then it does it again.
 And it's like, oh, I had no idea this would happen.
 I knew it would happen.
  </li><li>Okay, it's not driving a wedge in our marriage at all.
 But you're right, you finish the game
 and it rewards you with a whole new world.
 That's fairly complex.
 You finish that, you reward with it.
 Yeah, another world, which strange enough isn't as complex, but a lot of fun.
 And then it opens up to Third World, which is just fiendishly hard.
 It is impossibly difficult.
 There's only three...
 That's how they advertise it.
 There's only three...
 Fiendishly hard.
 Sir.
 There's only three levels in this world.
 And all of them are just ridiculously taxing.
 And I've beaten two of them.
 And the last one I've got to beat is called Champions Road.
 And your average game lasts, what?
 Seven seconds.
 If that.
 And so I'm an artist that I spent playing yesterday.
 Five.
 And you were so gracious.
 You didn't complain.
 You were.
 I was plotting the wheeze to my eyes.
 I was like, I wonder if I threw it out of my window, if it would survive.
 Or if I'd have to take it someplace higher.
 The trouble is it just suits my personality tight perfectly.
 It does.
 Well, because it's wonderfully executed.
 I mean, there's just excellence all over it.
 And it's inherently addictive, which I think is the reason I don't drink coffee.
 I thought it was because you don't like the taste.
 But anyway, I'm trying to ask what to finish this game so you can be put over your misery.
 Does that mean I can throw it out after you finished it?
 No, no, because then the girls will want to finish it.
 It's never ending.
 Speaking of the girls.
 Today.

 (laughing)
  </li><li>You're so welcome.
  </li><li>You're so welcome.
 You did an awesome job.
 Well done.
 So we have Paleo Donuts.
 We have Champions Road.
 So all in all, I don't know, it's good and the bad
 kind of equaled themselves out when we had an okay week.
 Yeah, we did. Yeah. I finished down to Nabi. Well, that's what happens when you have a back injury.
 Yes, that's correct. You get stuck lying dead for an evening and you finish the TV you haven't watched.
 All right, our topic for this week. I actually wanted to talk about our salvation story of how we
 got saved. Okay. Talk to me about how you got saved. I got saved, I think, because my cousin didn't
 stopped praying for me every, every single night for years and years and years. But basically,
 what happened was I was about 15 and my evangelist Baptist cousin invited me to a youth retreat.
 And so I headed off to the youth retreat and I wasn't really going for the right reasons.
 But I was told that there would be cute boys there and, you know, fun to be had with snow and
 such, which is the essential components of a testament.
 Yes, of course, cute boys and snow.
 Yeah.
 And so anyway, I went to this youth retreat and I think everyone else there was saved
 except for me.
 I think it was the only heathen present because they all knew the songs and such.
 And so anyway, went the first night and the guy got up and spoke.
 And he was one of these really sort of demonstrative, obnoxious youth speakers.
 And I remember him saying, "What am I?
 I have four legs.
 I stay in families.
 I have a soft back.
 I'm a cherished possession."
 He said a few other things I still can't remember.
 And I remember thinking, "Dude, you're totally a dog.
 Like you're a dog.
 And we're not kids here.
 Let's move on."
 sort of kind of aggravated. I knew Snacks came right after the service and then we get to go out
 in the snow and so I wasn't, you know, I wasn't very happy with him and his rhetoric. And anyway,
 so he was saying such things and then he put up this overhead of a chair. Now, do you know what
 an overhead is? An overhead is the cost of doing business?
 Yes, but in this case, an overhead was a thin piece of plastic that we used to be able to draw
 things on or print onto that we would shine up onto the side of the wall.
 It's like an analog version of keynote.
 A very analog version of keynote.
 Okay.
 And so he put up this chair and I remember thinking, "You're a chair?
 I don't understand." And he went on to explain that you can know everything about something and
 and still miss what it is, you know,
 'cause he could use the same descriptives of a chair
 as he could of a dog.
 And I remember thinking like, what it did for me was,
 I always kind of grew up thinking I was a Christian.
 I don't know why.
 Other than I grew up in Canada
 and I wasn't a Muslim and her Hindu,
 so therefore it was a Christian, if that makes sense.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And we celebrated Christmas and Easter
 by having Easter eggs and giving presents a Christmas.
 Do you know what I mean?
 So I was like, oh no, I'm a Christian.
 And I had no idea it was a butter relationship with God or anything.
 Anyway, he, so when he said that, it sort of got my attention because I was like,
 what is he talking about?
 And he spent the rest of the time that he was speaking, talking about the love of God.
 And I remember for the first time
 that I can remember when I was 15 thinking
 if what he's saying is true, then somebody loves me.
 I mean, not my brother, sister, more and not, you know,
 But somebody actually just loves me.
 And if that's true, it changes everything.
 So I got anxious that he was talking too long because I I wanted to sign on the dotted line as a word.
 Like I was like, okay, dude, like they all knew the songs.
 They all get it.
 You know, they all came from their shiny, happy Baptist churches.
 And I need to do this now.
 And he kept talking and talking.
 And so eventually I just pushed past all these little people in the row and ran up to the front and
 I now don't deserve crying and I gave my life to the Lord
 Like he had to stop speaking to lead me to the Lord because I was kind of loud
 He relies aside from the awesomeness of your life being given to Christ
 You probably made that young man's weekend. Oh, oh, yeah, I would think so. Yeah, I mean
 It's every preacher's dream to be interrupted why you're preaching because people want to respond to the message
 you've not yet finished.
 Right.
 Yeah, it was really cool.
 I remember though at the end, I was marching back and forth across the back of the room.
 I have no idea why I was doing that, but I'm pretty sure that wasn't the Baptist thing
 to do at the time.
 You're probably all scared at this point.
 Yeah, they're probably like, "Wow, I think she's had a psychotic break."
 I love when you tell that story.
 I mean, I love it for so many reasons.
 Like one, it's an absolute brilliant presentation of why you need the gospel.
 especially for like you say, you know, somebody who grew up thinking they were Christian because
 they grew up in a Christian nation. Like it's such a powerful picture. But two, I love how you
 tell it because it's how you found the love of God. And three, I just love it because it's how you
 got saved. But your out your salvation experience sounds fuller than my understanding of my salvation
 experience. Like I got saved when I was seven. I think I don't even remember what I was. I have
 this nominal age of seven. But I think I'm an actor who up in the church, I grew up in an
 evangelical home. I knew all about God. And I think it was just like the obvious thing to do.
 Like well, duh, two plus two equals four, of course. But it's hard to tell what you were saved from.
 Right. That's a very good point. It was really hard for me to tell what I was saved from. And my
 pre-Christian, my pre-salvation life and my post-salvation life looked identical. Now, of course,
 my eternal destination change but my day to day life.
 I don't remember anything changing.
 But what all changed for me was I met the Holy Spirit in my 20s.
 And I've told the story many times if it gave me if you heard it before, but it's such a great
 story is worth telling because the Holy Spirit changed my life.
 Was I got dragged really well, I got invited, but I kind of went out of spite really.
 a friend of mine who is it.
 I was in university with she went to a completely different church, a church.
 I would never set foot in a church.
 Probably quite like Grey Center, you know, I'd never been in a church where people
 danced or raised their hands in worship.
 And I hate it.
 I hate everything about it.
 Like the people had flags and banners.
 I was like, what the heck is this?
 Like show and tell.
 And what's worse is they were waving their flags and banners in front of the
 screen where all the words were to the songs I didn't know.
 And what was worse is they sang the songs over and over and over again.
 And I was just so furious.
 I just thought this thing was ridiculous.
 And everyone looked so happy.
 And of course, I was so cynical in those days
 I was like, look at these people, blah, blah, blah, blah,
 you know, so I'm just super angry.
 And I think we're just in the most ridiculous place ever.
 But, you know, I don't have a car,
 so I'm waiting for the service to be over
 from my friends to drive me home.
 And I think God, I don't even know if what I'm in is real.
 I don't even know if these people believe in Jesus, right?
 I mean, clearly they did, but it was so sad, my comfort zone.
 I was just super nervous.
 And I said, God, I bet you they're going to want to pray for me, but I don't want
 prayer for them, but I'll make you this deal.
 If you have them call me out for prayer, I'll go forward for prayer.
 And so the singing and the dancing is over and the, you know, the guy gets up to
 preach and he's, uh, he's preaching and he says, Hey, does that only need to be
 baptized in the Holy Spirit?
 And so my friends start nudging like, have you been baptized in the Holy
 And I'm thinking, well, I've been baptized and I have the Holy Spirit.
 So yes, and they're like, no, I've been baptized in the Holy Spirit.
 I'm like, yes, I've been baptized and I have the Holy Spirit.
 And so this went around a couple of times and they were like, Oh, just go for prayer.
 So reluctantly, I went out for prayer.
 And the guy goes to pray for me, but I don't know any of the protocol.
 Like I have my hands in my pocket.
 So he just smiles really kind of chuckles.
 He says, take your hands like your pocket, like you're going to receive a gift.
 And I'm like, whatever floats your bow, you know,
 so I'm standing there, hard, hard, super cynical,
 thinking these guys were all deceived.
 And then he prays for me in the name of Jesus
 for the Holy Spirit to come and fill me up.
 And I remember feeling like I was wobbly.
 I thought there's a floor on the even in here.
 And then I felt like he was pushing me,
 so I opened my eyes, but he wasn't pushing me.
 And then the next thing I know,
 I'd fallen down on the ground and I thought,
 that's the weirdest thing ever.
 And then I thought it didn't work because I had always thought that when people
 fell to the ground, they were not done conscious.
 And I was okay.
 Right.
 And I was completely conscious.
 I was just like, wow, what's playing these circles?
 Like how long do I stay down for?
 Right.
 So I just thought, well, I'll just command a crawl back to my seat.
 So I rolled out my front command to crawl back to my seat and thought nothing
 of it.
 And the guy keeps preaching and then, you know, he stops maybe five, 10 minutes
 later and points at me and says, "You sir, you really need prayer."
 And I remembered why it said to the Lord, "So you called me out and you prayed for me."
 And I thought, "You got me once.
 You're not going to get me again.
 I'm going to make sure I don't fall over."
 And before I could work out, I was on the ground.
 And this time it worked because I was just sobbing uncontrollably, just sobbing, sobbing,
 sobbing.
 Now, I didn't go home at that point.
 Speaking of times, seeing angels, you know, I don't think I could appoint anything that
 changed.
 But when I looked at my life subsequent to that, I can trace back everything changing
 to that point.
 So I got saved when I was seven.
 I think I understood what salvation was when I was in my twenties.
 Well, salvation feels like a journey, doesn't it?
 It's...
 Yeah, it's a good way of putting it.
 Comes in stages.
 Because I would say, you know, for me as well, like I knew my eternal destination changed,
 but I certainly wouldn't have the understanding that I have now or the relationship or the
 understanding the Holy Spirit or anything like that.
 Right.
 So it's where you start from.
 Because this is the amazing thing about salvation is it's a journey home.
 You know, I love Jesus said, I am the way, the truth and the life.
 And you know, you and others have taught us that, you know, for Jesus to be the
 way there must be a destination.
 The destination, of course, is the Father.
 No one comes to the Father but by me.
 And so, you know, starting that process of salvation and then the journey into understanding what
 salvation is and what it's done for you is incredible.
 Yeah. And it, I don't, I don't think it ever looks the same for any two people.
 You know, it's just God is so individual and specific and he knows our needs.
 And we each have our own story of that romance and how it goes down.
 We have a friend who was killed in a terrorist attack on her church.
 She was blown up by a bomb that was planted, one of four bombs on her church.
 And she died and then came back to life again.
 Yeah.
 And the amazing thing about her is when you're around her,
 almost the first question she'll ask you when she means you is,
 tell me how you made Jesus.
 Yeah, it's her favorite thing to know.
 And she just loves hearing the story.
 And I think, you know, I listened to your testimony of how you got saved.
 And I think, I don't have a very good testimony.
 You know that stupid thought that goes through the church,
 I don't have a good testimony.
 Like you were wishing you had more trauma in your life
 than Jesus rescued you from, rather than appreciating.
 You know, but me telling my testimony to her was amazing.
 She just wept all the way through it
 because she never had a Christian home to grew up in.
 So she was listening to this like,
 "Oh, but I love people's salvation stories
 'cause you can trace the kindness of God
 all through their lives."
  </li><li>Regardless of what the story is,
 you can trace the kindness of God.
 like what you're saying about, you know,
 oh, I don't have the same testimony or whatever.
 Like, I know so many people that their testimony is,
 they got saved when they were really young
 and they never went off the rails
 and they still love Jesus
 and they're in their 30s or 40s or whatever.
 To me, I mean, that's an awesome testimony.
 That's the testimony I want my kids to have.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know, that God kept you.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>That the kindness of God kept you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You know, so, I mean, I think no matter what your story is,
 powerful and your testimony unlocks things for other people if you'll share it.
 James Galvus was speaking at Grace in her last Sunday and he said something that really
 struck me and he was talking about the Jesus movement in the 60s or 70s, sorry, 70s big
 apart and he was talking about how the motto was just one way and he said, "You know it's
 amazing how Christianity today has gotten so, we've equipped the church so well but in
 In the midst of that, there's a danger that we lose sight of the one thing that's important,
 which is Jesus Christ.
 We can focus on angels and prophecy and dreams and all this sort of stuff.
 But Jesus is...
 And I was like, "Yes, that's absolutely amazing."
 And I thought on our website for all the training and equipping stuff that we have in our website,
 we don't actually have anything on our website about how we get saved.
 So I was just thinking, "Oh my gosh."
 And part of that is because I think a large portion of our call is reaching Christians
 for Christ. But actually, you know, I don't want somebody to end up on a website and not
 find out a way to give their life to Jesus. So here's the thing, if you haven't listened
 to this podcast and you maybe have been given this episode by a friend who's like, Oh, you
 know what, they were just asking me, maybe I'll send them this podcast list for tell.
 Here's what you need to know about salvation, about the free gift of God is that God is
 the kindest person you'll ever meet in your entire life. And he's crazy about you. And
 It says in the Bible that he planned all your days before you even lived one of them.
 It says elsewhere that his plans for you are to prosper you, to give you hope in the future.
 And in short, God is crazy in love with you.
 He's mad about you.
 He wants to do life with you.
 He wants to live with you.
 He wants to unfold this never-ending story of kindness in your life.
 That's absolutely his intent and his heart towards you.
 Unfortunately, the thing that's got in the way between that being a reality for him.
 is sin in the world and sin is simply described as anything, everything that's wrong with
 the world is sin. So the Bible has a lot to say about sin but you know there's the 10
 commandments to start there. So stealing and killing and adultery and cheating and lying
 and you know, coveting things and you know, just this massive stuff. And so wrong thoughts,
 wrong words, wrong actions. Anything that doesn't line up with God's glorious standard
 is sin. And the problem with sin is there's nothing we can do to remove sin. No man is
 self-help, no man of effort, no man of earnest deeds, no man of promises, no man of striving
 efforts, religious behavior, charitable work, nothing can remove sin from our lives. And
 So we're cursed with this sin that, you know, Paul writes about it.
 Like even when I want to do good things, I end up doing bad things.
 Like, you know, that's the problem with the human race.
 And God looking at that and realizing we were helpless was so
 desperate for relationship with us that he decides to do something about himself.
 And he decided to come and sacrifice himself to take away the curse that is
 sin. Now that sounds just crazy, but we could go into that a little bit more
 detail. Basically, the Bible says that the fruit, the penalty, the results, the wages
 of sin is death. And so someone has to pay for all the wrong that's been done. And so
 Jesus came and he died on a cross. He died a horrible, vicious death, was tortured and
 murdered so that he could break the power of sin over our lives. And here's the gospel
 in a very, very succinct manner.
 That if you believe that Jesus Christ is God and he came to rescue us from sin,
 and that he died on a cross and he rose again, if you believe that message and you believe that
 by believing in him, that you can have eternal life with him and that your sins will be forgiven,
 that's it. It's purely faith-based. So people point and they want evidence and they want reason.
 At the end of the day, it's a decision that in your heart, you realize, you know what?
 I'm a sinner in need of a savior.
 I have done wrong things.
 And I know I cannot change.
 I can modify my behavior, but it actually doesn't change the desires of my heart.
 Then you're, you've taken the first step, you've realized you need a savior.
 The second step is to just realize that Christ died for you.
 And the, you know, if you were the only person in need of a savior, he would have died for you.
 And so if you've ever been in debt, you know, crippled by debt,
 then imagine somebody coming and not only wiping out your debt,
 but actually giving you an inheritance as well of millions and millions of dollars.
 That's affected what Jesus did in the spare realm.
 Not only did he pay for all your sin,
 returning you to a zero balance, he gave you an inheritance.
 And it's incredible. You get to start this journey with God.
 And so the second stage is just saying, "Yeah, Jesus, I believe you did that."
 And the third stage is doing something about your belief.
 And the Bible says, if you confess with your mouth and believe with your heart,
 that Jesus is the Christ, that he is the Savior of the world and you will be saved.
 And what's amazing and what's unique about the Christian faith
 is all other faiths are an attempt for you to do things to reach God.
 The Christian faith is a document of what he did to reach you.
 Right.
 And you just need to RSVP.
 You just need to say, Jesus, I believe that you died on a cross for me.
 Would you forgive me my sins?
 And would you come and transform my life by the power of your Holy Spirit?
 And just like that, if you prayed that prayer like that, your life can be transformed.
 Now, here's what we'd love to do.
 Whether you're a Christian or not a Christian, we would love to pray for you
 right now and bless you and pray that the Holy Spirit would come and fill your life.
 So Jesus, we ask that you would touch the hearts of everyone who's listening to this.
 Yeah. Whether they know you or whether they don't, Lord, that you would begin to move on their heart.
 You would begin to we read them with your kindness, Lord. You begin to be so kind to them
 that you wear them down. Thank you. Until they can just say,
 "I'm a sinful man and I need you." Like Peter's Revelation, the abundance that you want to bring
 in our lives, Lord, would you come and bring revelation? Would you open eyes, Lord? Would you
 open our hearts to receive the truth that you are the Messiah, that you are the rescuer
 of people, you are rescuer of nations. Lord, for those of us who have given our heart to
 you, for those of us who are Christians, Lord, for those of us who have taken on the name
 of Jesus, Lord, would you come and fill us afresh with your wonderful Holy Spirit?
 Just wherever you are right now in your car, in a coffee shop, at home, Holy Spirit, would
 you begin to move, Lord, just through the speakers, through the headphones and just begin to touch
 people's hearts. Would you begin to baptize people right now with your wonderful Holy Spirit?
 Lord, would you have people forward on this message to people? Would there be a chain reaction of
 salvation and filling up the Holy Spirit? Lord, we just thank you for what you've done.
 Thank you for the people that are listening to this right now. They may they be changed forever
 and ever. Amen. Amen. I had a funny thought while you were praying the Holy Spirit part.
 Was it me in a clown hat with a big squeaky nose? You know it wasn't. It wasn't
  </li><li>It's changing.
  </li><li>Okay, well, absolutely.
  </li><li>It was that, you know, I've talked to several people
 who listened to our podcast while they're working out,
 and my thought was if they got hit by the Holy Spirit
 on like a treadmill or an elliptical machine,
 it could be--
  </li><li>Father, for those people,
 it could make a great video.
  </li><li>Would you just fill them right in the hat?
 Would you fill in with your wonderful Holy Spirit?
 Would you just say, "Fire in the name of Jesus."
 (laughs)
  </li><li>All of a sudden, there's reports of like runners
 found in ditches and (laughs)
 sorry.
 Oh babe, we had a listeners question.
 It was a great question.
  </li><li>We also need to tell them about the conference.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, we'll do that as our closing thing.
 How about that? - Okay.
  </li><li>Okay, so we had a listeners question.
 This is a brilliant question.
 This is from Danielle.
 She said, "Hey, AJ, hey, Alan.
 "I lived in Tennessee a few years ago
 "and went to Grayson or an Amine.
 "While there, I went on an encounter weekend
 "and felt so impacted by the healing weekend.
 "Thank you for that.
 "You're welcome.
 "Actually, we have an encounter weekend just finishing today."
  </li><li>Yes, we do.
  </li><li>So a great time.
 Since then, I feel that I may be in need
 of another encounter weekend,
 but I no longer live in the area.
 How do you recommend I go about such a thorough experience
 on my own since I'm not aware of anything similar
 being offered by a local church?
  </li><li>Well, there's several outside ministries
 that do things similar to the encounter weekend.
 So like restoring the foundations,
 which their website is restoringyourlife.org
 or heart sink is another one that specializes in inner healing.
 So if you're just wanting to sort of go after your stuff
 and say, Lord, I invite you into the midst
 of whatever is still causing owies,
 to deal with that stuff.
 You could go to either one of those places.
 I think, are we gonna release a box set soon of the--
  </li><li>We're working on a inner healing resource teaching,
 but it's very, very hard.
 I realized while I was editing the teaching,
 to put the teaching in a remote context.
 So you ask a brilliant question,
 is there any way I can go through this stuff on my own?
 And here's the difficulty is God has deliberately designed
 the local church to be the context for his outworking.
 And while I'm not saying this is your heart at all,
 I'm just flagging this as an interesting dynamic
 in people's lives today.
 It's amazing how many people want to live
 Christian life free of the church or on their own. And the difficulty is God made us to need
 one another. So the very thing we need is found in someone else. So, you know, part of our
 problem is how do you make an inner healing resource that's designed to be listened to
 in a culture and a community, something that you can listen to on your own? Because I do think
 it's necessary and do think it's needed, but we don't have that available yet because I haven't
 thought about a good way of doing that. But yeah, look at those resources and I'm sure
 there's ministers who are in your area who'd love to be able to minister to you and we can't
 recommend highly enough the journey of inner healing is absolutely incredible.
 AJ Jones talked us about the more conferences happening this May 15th to 16th.
 We are so stinking excited. Stinking excited I tell you.
 stinking excited. We have both the Hellsers. Jonathan David and Melissa Hells.
 Yeah, coming into lead worship, which if you haven't heard them, you've probably heard their
 songs whether you realize it or not. Just amazing, anointed songwriters and worship leaders.
 So super excited about them coming. And then we also have Graham Cook, who's coming to speak.
 So it's going to be a fantastic packed two days. And if those names don't mean anything to you,
 Here's the deal. They're probably like Jonathan David and Melissa are some of the most incredible
 songwriters. And as Edgy said, you're probably singing their songs in their church right now.
 You might not know that they're songs. They wrote some of the amazing songs in the new
 Bethel album. They're just going to sign a Bethel worship. And so they're just going to be an absolute
 treat for sure. We'll put some links in the show notes so you can go watch some of your YouTube
 videos and catch a feel for who they are. Oh, that's a great idea. And Graham's one of the pre-eminent
 charismatic speakers, teachers, prophets in the kingdom today. He's got longevity in the spirit.
 He's been in prophetic ministry since the 70s. He's originally from England, so he has a wonderful
 voice to listen to. Now lives in California. He's an amazing teacher, amazing prophet,
 full of wisdom, full of revelation. He was with us five years ago at Grace Center.
 And he's humorous. He's just a ball of wisdom. We love Graham to pieces, and so we're really
 excited he's going to be back. But it's going to be a sold-out conference. We would love you
 to get in on the action. If you go to musthavemore.com and are quick, you can get tickets for around
 about $50. But there's only a few of those tickets. After that, the price goes up to
 $60. And after that, the price goes up to $80. So we would love you guys to be in on
 the action. If you live abroad, you listen to podcasts, you don't live in America, you're
 not in the Tennessee area, you will be able to watch the conference online. There's a
 charge there for each of the sessions. I think it's $10 a session. So you can watch
 that as well and we'll make the MP3s available after the conference as well but highly recommend
 that you come.
 It's going to be an amazing time.
 Yeah, for sure.
 So yay.
 So yay, God.
 Amen.
 All right, have a great week, people.
 Bye.
