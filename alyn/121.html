<p> I live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes, sir.<br/>
 You're looking great in your army jacket.
 Thank you.<br/>
 It freaks out the green of my eyes, my army green eyes.
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong><br/>
 I love your khaki eyes.<br/>
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong><br/>
 You sound rather tired.<br/>
 I'm exhausted.<br/>
 Is it because you've just spent a whole weekend away?
 Yes. What was more exhausting the drive there and the drive back?
 All the time there.<br/>
 The drive there and the drive back.<br/>
 Yeah, no, it was.<br/>
 I had a lot of influencers on this trip and describe influencers for people who are
 not fluent in life languages.<br/>
 They like to talk a lot about everything and they're super excited.
 Yes.<br/>
 They want connection at all times.<br/>
 Yes, and they're very sweet.<br/>
 And for the most part, they didn't try and include me in the conversation, which
 nice, because I had very little people juice left to give.
 All your people juice was depleted.<br/>
 Yeah, who was gone?<br/>
 So what do you do in situations like that?
 As a contemplator, who needs time alone to recharge when you're spending five hours in
 a car with high influencers?<br/>
 I played music kind of loudly in the front of the car.
 What's a drama conversation?<br/>
 Like, Kerry and I listened to, and Kerry was being introverted and I was being relatively
 introverted and just singing along and trying to focus on that.
 I have a nice casting headphone for situations like that and a happy place.
 But they wouldn't plug into my new iPhone 7.
 And the Bluetooth headphones aren't out yet.
 No.<br/>
 You want the earpods, don't you?<br/>
 I do.<br/>
 Aren't you worried that you're going to lose the earpods?
 No.<br/>
 How many pairs of sunglasses have you lost?
 Sunglasses are completely different.<br/>
 They go flying off the top of your head.
 Yes.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Earpods are different.<br/>
 Because they're small and could just get them to place easily.
 It'll be fine.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 You had a good weekend?<br/>
 I did have a great weekend.<br/>
 Are you a horse?<br/>
 A little bit.<br/>
 I started sneezing like half an hour outside of Nashville.
 I'm like, "Oh, we're back in allergy zone."
 Yeah.<br/>
 I was a great weekend.<br/>
 I love the ladies of Southgate.<br/>
 They're fantastic.<br/>
 When you were in Tulsa?<br/>
 No.<br/>
 Close?<br/>
 St. Louis.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And no, actually, St. Louis and Tulsa are not close at all.
 No, but St. Louis in Kansas City are close.
 Yes.<br/>
 More so than Tulsa.<br/>
 Well, I just like to just flex my geography skills from time and time.
 Well done.<br/>
 Well done.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 At least they're real places in America and I'm not just making up names.
 It's true.<br/>
 I mean, this is advanced to you.<br/>
 I often get confused between states and cities.
 I've noticed that before.<br/>
 Let's move on.<br/>
 When Abigail starts studying geography, I'll do that part.
 Yeah.<br/>
 So this week, my dad was here.<br/>
 Yes, he was.<br/>
 I took him on a tour of the most important things in life.
 Donuts, juice bars, barbecue.<br/>
 He's so easy to look after, really.<br/>
 You just feed him.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Insert donut, sit back.<br/>
 Mm-hmm.<br/>
 And I got the best photos of him all over Nashville.
 Yeah, you totally did.<br/>
 He's lovely and very low maintenance.<br/>
 I tried to get him back here for Christmas, but he wasn't biting.
 I think that would be awesome.<br/>
 Don't be so fine. The girls would love that.
 Speaking of the girls, they started ballet classes week.
 They did.<br/>
 Do you want to talk about that?<br/>
 Yeah, we entered them into ballet classes with his town dance studio, so we're super stoked.
 What's really sweet is at that age you don't have enough self-awareness to know what you need to learn.
 Yeah, I mean, I think because Tia's been watching YouTube videos of ballet and practicing on
 her own upstairs, she thinks she's pretty good to go.
 They're super cute.<br/>
 I took so many videos of them all.<br/>
 The age looks similar, like all the kids in that class, even though Tia's just joined
 it and the other kids have got like, you know, three weeks on her or whatever, they're all
 pretty, pretty similar.<br/>
 don't maybe think, oh, it's part of the age as well.
</p><ul>
  <li>Well, what was interesting was MJ's disappointment
 that he couldn't do ballet.
  </li><li>Yes, he really wanted to go.
  </li><li>I don't think he knows what ballet is.
 I think he just sees his sister doing things.
 Like it's been funny because we've been renovating
 their rooms and before we even moved to
 to clear it as she wanted to chandelier.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And then, well, because Tia wanted to chandelier,
 then Abigail wanted to chandelier.
 And now MJ wants to chandelier just because the girls
 go to chandeliers. I've been trying to steer him away from chandeliers ballet class.
 Oh dear. Did I tell you who went to?
 We should probably put him in baseball or something just so that we can turn this tide around.
 I can do one better. I tell you that I took him to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
 I'm sorry. Me and MJ went to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu class.
 And when did you do that exactly? About two weeks ago. I mean, we didn't actually go to a class.
 We went to the place and inquired about how much they would be.
 i'm sorry and i'm just hearing about this now live on air also we got tears here
 is your line and a belly button and belly button actually asked her as it
 mom's away do you want to get your ears pierced and she's like dad
 i said well okay what about your nose she's like dad i thought what about your
 belly button she's like i'm not old enough to get my belly button
 here at least somebody has a nice comment
  </li><li>Picking news of the week, I got my iPhone.
  </li><li>You did.
  </li><li>In a really nice turn of events, Apple emailed me.
 So here's what happened.
 We're part of the iPhone upgrade program.
 And when I woke up at 1201 Pacific time,
 which was 201 Central Standard Time,
 all the phones were gone.
  </li><li>Already?
  </li><li>There was no T-Mobile.
 And the reason for that is everybody wants T-Mobile phones
 'cause they come unlocked, carrier unlocked.
 So couldn't get any.
 And so Apple were kind enough to email me and just say, hey, we're sorry.
 We know that you're trying to get a phone and you can't just call this
 number and speak to one of our reps.
 So you called on behalf of me because I was teaching.
 I did.
 And how long did that take?
 I don't know.
 I was teaching.
 It was over an hour.
 It was an hour and 20.
 It was true love right there.
 It was true love.
 Yep.
 And so I couldn't go potty that whole time.
 I was terrified that the second I tried to go potty, it was the guy would come back
 and be like, Mrs. Jones.
 Very blessed love right there.
 And it worked because they just said, well, what is your husband looking for?
 And so you told them.
 And then within six days, they sent me an email saying, hey, we've got one.
 It's not available for public infantry.
 But if you could turn up at this store and ask the people to the manager and show them this email, they'll give you a phone.
 And right now for went and got it.
 And what are you now thinking?
 I'm now thinking about getting the seven plus.
 And this should be interesting because you mocked me relentlessly for getting a six plus two years ago.
 Well, that's true, but now the camera is amazing on the seven plus.
 I've been sending you photos, haven't I?
 You have.
 It was like torture, but great torture, because I wanted to see the kidlets.
 Here's what's amazing.
 So Apple does a great job of their PR.
 And so they're talking about how great the screen is, but there's no way you can
 tell how great the screen is until you've seen how great the screen is because they
 can't take photos of it because most computer monitors, most photos, most prints
 don't have a wide enough color gamut to show you the display of colors.
 You actually have to see them.
 So I took the girls while you were away.
 I was single-dead for the weekend.
 So I took the kids out to their school was doing what do you call it?
 A fair and some of the shining is beautiful.
 And I just use my phone to grab some pictures of them.
 And I was astonished at the quality of the photos.
 Now, do you have to pick between what lens you're using or does it know to do it itself?
 So here's the thing.
 Every time you take a photo, both lenses fire and then the computer automatically
 decides which one is the better photo, but you can also force it to use one or the other.
 Did you force it in all this weekend or did you just take pictures?
 The only thing I forced it in is the new iPhone 7 Plus has an option to do what's
 called portrait mode, which effectively gives you a shallow depth of field.
 So you take a photo and the person in the foreground is in focus and everything in
 the background has what's called a Boca effect.
 So I'm beta testing that feature and use that that you can specifically turn that on.
 It slows down your camera a little bit, but the results are beautiful.
 And when you take a photo of that, it gives you two photos for every photo you take.
 One with the shallow depth of field turned on and one regular off.
 Oh, great.
 I've been so impressed.
 The screen is amazing.
 The camera is fast.
 The picture quality is stunning.
 I'm really enjoying it.
 And now am I on the same correctly that you want to return your small phone and upgrade
 to the big phone?
 I really might.
 I want to actually take your phone and my phone outside maybe tomorrow break and try
 and take pictures of the same thing and just see what the difference is.
 I'm sure we can come to some sort of agreement.
 Okay.
 Visa v rental.
 Mm hmm.
 Okay.
 You also killed it as a domestic god this weekend.
 I mean, it's a do list.
 you killed her to do this almost the only thing I couldn't do was because I needed to go back to
 home people and I couldn't face doing that with three children they were amazing basically I was
 going to take them to the movies and then here's what I realized I was a fool I gave them options
 just don't give three children of different ages options no because they just don't harmonize but
 if you tell them this is what we're going to do they're all excited so we bought the angry birds
 movie. MJ said he loved it. And T loved it. They just kind of giggled out, watched bits
 and pieces of the book, mind you, they just watched that and I fed them and then put them
 to work. And I did a bunch of jobs around the house. You did. I came home to the bathroom,
 master bathroom being totally unpacked and clean and our master closet.
 Yep. Again, it was full of boxes. It's totally unpacked and clean. And the kitchen is gorgeous
 and clean and everything's ready for lunches in the morning.
 And you've done a whole bunch of laundry and then upstairs is everything's clean.
 And then you also hung a the whole closet organizing system in MJ's closet.
 I'm kind of a big deal.
 You are a big deal.
 Well, it's amazing.
 We're shocking.
 When you don't have another adult to say no, you can't throw that out around the house.
 You can just dream line.
 What are you talking about?
 Let's move on.
 You've just literally walked in the house.
 Yeah.
 It's about 10 p.m.
 Yeah.
 You're tired.
 Yeah. We weren't creative enough to come up with a topic. But thankfully, our listeners were kind
 enough to send us a bunch of questions. Oh, good. And they're great questions. Oh, good.
 And so I'm going to read them and you answer them. Okay. Okay. This question is from Neil.
 This is such a great question. He says, "You've been speaking a lot about expectation and blessing
 and how good God is. How do we balance the expectation of blessing with being content in all things?
 I don't feel like they're opposite, but I feel attention between them in my heart.
 Bingo.
 Great question, Neil.
 The answer is, gosh, it really is a great question.
 How do you balance being thankful for what you have with having expectation for more?
 Is that what you mean?
 Yeah.
 While you're thinking about that answer, do I tell you that remember how last week I was at the dentist and they cut my tongue and I got temporary crowns put on the temporary crowns fell off this after.
 So disgusting.
 So I have like tiny stumps.
 They're super sensitive to air.
 Nice.
 But yeah, so there's that.
 So you have to call the dentist in the morning.
 Meanwhile, back to the answer.
 What's the answer?
 Um, gosh, I don't, I don't know.
 Uh, I don't think those two things are at war.
 I mean, I think being thankful is, is, is a position of your heart.
 So I don't think I'm just trying to think about like, do I struggle with that?
 I think I feel constantly thankful for all the different things that God's done or that He's
 given us or that He's allowed us to be a part of that kind of thing.
 But I know that there's always more. So I feel like it's me being faithful to understanding that
 that he's good, that keeps me in expectation,
 as well as thankfulness.
  </li><li>Right.
 I think the reason I've been talking a lot about
 how good God is and blessings from God,
 is because the Lord himself has been coming to me
 and saying, Alan, you have a really dim view of me.
 It's not that I'm stepping into this revelation
 because I'm frustrated,
 I'm living below the glory standard that God has for me.
 I think in some sense,
 I've been living with the ceiling over my life going, you know, no, this is good enough.
 I'm just a worm, you know, I'm just really grateful for salvation, which of course I
 am, but not having an expectation on the goodness of God.
 And the Lord being like, Hey, actually, I'd love to challenge your view of my goodness.
 So I'm kind of caught up in this whirlwind of God's goodness at his behest, it feels
 like.
 And what's challenged me is this notion where I've lived in lack of the goodness of God.
 And so I think if anything, it's the Lord coming to me going,
 "You've made me too small in your eyes, Alan."
 And him just flexing his muscle, so to speak, of his goodness and me being astonished by it.
 but I think it would be a tragedy if we lived with a place of grumbling or complaining.
 And I think that's where that content and all things. Like Paul says, you know,
 I know what it's like to be in need and I know it's like to have abundance. I've learned to be
 content and all things. And I think that's amazing. Like I can't say I've been content and all things,
 but I've tried to posture my heart in that way. And I think of the various seasons I've been
 through in life. And this is the beauty of God. You can always find His goodness at work
 in your life.
 And I've been processing that a bit this week. I was earlier in the week. I was just chatting
 with God and talking to the Lord. And I felt like He said, I was talking to Him about cars,
 because I like cars.
 Of course you do.
 And so I was talking to him, like I was just sort of thinking about, oh, you know, there's
 this particular car that I like.
 And I was like, huh?
 And I felt like the Lord said, well, why don't you ask me for that?
 And I thought, well, because then it feels like, I don't know, it feels ungrateful,
 I suppose, to be asking for a car.
 I mean, we have a car that works, you know, kind of thing.
 And we don't necessarily need a second car and, you know, everything's fine.
 But I still felt like he was saying, but why can't you, why can't you like sort of stretch
 out towards my goodness?
 And I thought, okay, okay.
 So I've been having this conversation, but I have been going back and forth between the,
 then I don't know if I'm explaining it well, like the wanting to expect good things and
 making sure that you're not ungrateful.
 I think the interesting passage that I preached on a while back about,
 it's actually when David sins with Bathsheba and the Lord comes to him and says,
 "You know what? I gave you the wives of your enemy."
 If that had been too little, it's kind of like the Lord is a gas that David took things into his own
 hands and is pointing to his extravagance and his goodness towards David and said,
 And hey, if that hadn't been enough, and that passage really challenged me because I guess
 I'm still uncomfortable with God's goodness.
 I think I still get confused when God does things that delight my heart because I think
 probably in my upbringing, I was taught that anything my heart wanted was worldly.
 I remember the first time I went to John and Carol's house and they have a beautiful
 kitchen. When I went there, I just finished building the house and I walked in and I
 mean the kitchen was gorgeous. And I said, John, you have such a beautiful kitchen.
 And he said something to me that was really funny. And I said, well, you know, I think
 I've had an idol in my heart about nice kitchens. And John was like, why would you have an
 idol about nice kitchens? Like, what bizarre thing to have idolatry in your heart about?
 And I realized that me coming into appreciation of good things from God is understanding another
 facet of his heart, whereas I think I was probably raised to believe that that was worldly and
 that there was something wrong with that.
 So it's been a really interesting season.
 God just wrestling or putting his finger on things in my heart and me wrestling with
 them and then finding out it's him and not my greed nature at work.
 I think it's funny though because we don't think it's greed when tea wants to go to Disney.
 We're like yeah baby it's okay to ask god for that and it's extravagant.
 You know it's a good point but when when we would like something there's this struggle the adult struggles with.
 Well why do I want that and well let me give you an example of if if tea had a bad attitude about not getting i mean so t's want to go to Disney for the last couple of years.
 this year we went but last year if all t did was complain about how we never get to go to Disney,
 how would our hearts be turned towards her would that be a moment where we step in and give her help her with an attitude adjustment it absolutely would but the desire of itself isn't wrong,
 the grumbling and complaining that's not happening as fast as we'd like well i think that's where you get into trouble yeah so i think finding contentment,
 In all things and being thankful is the thing that opens the door to god doing i don't know what makes god do more i think god's nature is just more inherently but.
 I guess we don't have a great answer but you ask a great question i think we're just pondering allowed.
 I'd love to hear your thoughts. Anybody who's listening to this, you just email us or reach out on Twitter and let us know what you think.
 Yeah. Any other thoughts on that?
 I don't know. I mean, I think obviously it can be done to stay in a place of thankfulness and still expect more because we're there.
 But I understand the quandary of it. Like I understand that it's when you sit down and think about it.
 It's like, oh, that seems quite, they seem like opposites. I don't think that they are. But yeah, it's.
 It's hard to manage your heart sometimes.
 So, Neil asked a question about balancing the tension of being content and receiving blessing.
 This is an anonymous question about balancing our own emotions with codependency.
 You ready?
 Okay, I'll try and be ready.
 Hi, Alan, AJ.
 First, I want to say that I love listening to your podcast.
 I love listening to all of your teachings, but especially your teaching on boundaries.
 I recently had a very strange experience, though.
 A few weeks ago I found myself in a rather deep depression and I had no idea why.
 As I started to delve into it I realised that I had experienced a handful of small disappointments
 that on their own wouldn't have fazed me much, but because they all came at the same
 time they were a little overwhelming.
 But the real problem was that I refused to talk to anyone about them because I kept telling
 myself that I am in control of my emotions, they aren't anyone else's responsibility,
 so dealing with them is on me.
 I ended up getting quote unquote separated from the pack because of this line of thinking
 and it got really gross.
 So my question is how do we balance managing our own emotions with the need to be in community?
 How much sharing is healthy and how much is codependent?
 I mean, I think you need to have healthy relationships that you can talk to people and say, hey,
 I'm having a really difficult week or, you know, I've had this disappointment and this
 than this and I need to vent with some. I mean I have that. I have some friends that I could
 call and just be like, "Hey, this week's been really hard. Can I just vent with you?" And they'll
 pray with me or they'll tell me if I'm totally off base or whatever. I think you want to always
 stay in community. I mean, yes, you want to manage your emotions, absolutely, but you need to have
 some people that are safe. I think if you find that everywhere you're going, you're
 eking emotion, that's probably a different level.
 Well, I think the balance, I think the line into codependency gets crossed when I'm like,
 I'm not sharing these things with you for my sake. I'm sharing them with you for your
 sake so you can fix my problems. That's then codependency. There's nothing wrong with me
 calling Jeff and just in Jeff man I need to process a few things and my goal is like
 I'm using you as a sounding board I'm just sharing my heart with you I'd love
 any wisdom you have that's healthy that's healthy quite a different thing when I'm
 like hey Jeff I have these problems please fix them for me right that's
 co-dependency right or a spouse what do you mean or a spouse well I mean if you
 were to say hey AJ I have these problems fix them for me like good luck with that
 Yeah.
 Like, well, this is not going to be healthy for our marriage.
 Yeah.
 So I think, yeah, absolutely.
 I love what Dan Farley from Bethel says when talking about feelings.
 He's like, not everyone needs to know about all of your feelings or treat them
 tenderly all of the time.
 I think if you hold that intention that a real friend will not only listen to you,
 but will also tell you when to stop talking, you know, a good, I think,
 because of people we have in our lives who are just like,
 "Oh, I love you, but please stop talking."
 You sound like a broken record.
 Sometimes you need to hear that message too.
 Like how Alan, it sounds like you just want to complain
 rather than deal with your emotions.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So.
  </li><li>That's the whole thing of friends,
 stab you in the front.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>But again, it comes back to the boundary,
 teaching of there's nothing wrong with me sharing something
 with a trusted friend as long as I understand
 that it's my responsibility to change my climate system
 and not yours.
  </li><li>And if actually that friend has codependent tendencies,
 That's probably not the best person to share it with because then they get wrapped up in
 trying to fix you when actually it's something you can probably take to the Lord and get
 him to help you.
 This question is from Chelsea.
 And Chelsea says, "I'm a Christian and I have a dear friend who is an atheist.
 Until recently, this wasn't a problem.
 We conversed freely about deep issues and our friendship seemed to be one of mutual
 respect.
 The other night he started on a tirade about religion and hell and saying, "How dare anyone
 tell me that I'm going to hell?"
 Side note, I hadn't said anything of the sort to him.
 I was mostly silent as he vented his anger, but when he pointedly asked me if I believed
 he was going to hell, all I could think to say was, "I believe the only way to God is
 through Jesus Christ," from John 14 verse 6.
 Although I've only ever treated him with love and kindness, he now doesn't want me in his
 life anymore.
 My question is, how could I have better handled a discussion like this?
 I'm not into the whole one-sided lambasting of my beliefs.
 Does that make sense?
 Lambasting.
 No, we say lambasting here.
 You based lambs?
 I'm just saying that's how it's pronounced in North America.
 I can't wait to hear the podcast discussion on that one.
 I'm not into the whole one-sided lambasting of my beliefs, but is there a way to answer
 atheistic questions like that in a way that does not sound condemning but invites further
 dialogue?
 There's so many things, but before we even talk about lambasting or lambasting?
 I'm pretty sure it's lambasting, but I said lambasting because you thought I should say
 lambasting.
 Lambasting sounds like a cooking technique for preparing to eat lamb cutlets.
 I'm just going to base these lambs.
 You just have to trust me.
 You're in the new world now.
 We say at lamb based.
 I love when you're vicious, especially when you're wearing army colors.
 With my army green eyes.
 Wait, they're going camouflage.
 So the second thing I want to make, and I don't mean to be poking fun here,
 but it's amusing to me that an atheist would get upset about being sent to
 something they believe is a fictional place.
 Like that would be like Abigail coming to me going, daddy,
 I believe that you're going to Nanapupi headland.
 Like, why would that challenge my worldview when I don't believe in Nanapupi headland?
 Well, wow, that's a great example.
 Do you know what I mean?
 So, I'm thinking, I wonder what else is going on there.
 That's a very strong reaction to have about something you don't believe in.
 So I wonder if Chelsea, the reason that your friend is reacting so badly is not that you
 handled things poorly. I mean, from your description, it sounded like you held to your beliefs and
 you weren't caustic about it. You answered their question. I wonder if the Holy Spirit is doing
 a work in their life. Trying to get their attention or if they've had some dreams recently or something
 that's causing them to react like that. One of the prayers I used to pray over my friends,
 I'm not sure if this is going to sound good or not, but my friends who didn't know the Lord,
 I'd ask that the Lord that their hearts would be troubled to know the Lord.
 And I know that sounds mean, and I didn't mean that in a meanness, but just the empty satisfaction
 that's in the heart of an unbeliever is often covered up by the distractions of the world,
 buying things, other relationships, alcohol, whatever. But I'd ask the Lord that none of that stuff
 would work well in their life so that they would be troubled to find true satisfaction.
 And I wonder if that's what's happening in the life of your friend.
 And then the last thought I had is that the cross of Jesus Christ is a stumbling block.
 It is offensive.
 It is foolish to those who are not saved.
 So it sounds like it's on par.
 I'm really sorry that it sounds like right now that there's a relationship with a good
 friend that's broken.
 And I think probably your way forward is just to be consistent and kind.
 Yeah, I'm not really sure what you could have said better or that anything would have actually worked in that particular situation.
 I think what you said was, you know, accurate and it was kind.
 One of my favorite people, I've never met this person, but one of my favorite people to listen to is a gentleman called Ravi Zacharias.
 Yeah.
 who has got this amazing ability to handle questions
 from people of a wide variety of faith
 or non-believing people with such tact,
 with such care and with such genuine affection, love
 and respect that's astonishing,
 that he isn't in dialogue to win an argument.
 He's in a dialogue to represent Jesus well
 to people who don't yet know him.
 And I've long been provoked by Ravi's brilliant way
 of handling people.
 I wish I had half the people skills that he has,
 the way that he did that.
 He's just phenomenal.
 And if you're not familiar with Ravi Zakaray,
 so I really encourage you to just get on YouTube
 and just watch a couple of his videos,
 especially the way he deals.
 I wouldn't watch a long sermon, so to speak.
 I would probably just pick up his question, man, or stuff.
 And that may help.
 But again, I don't think you did anything wrong,
 Chelsea, from your description.
 But we'll be praying for your friend,
 and especially for your relationship.
 I'm sad that currently it's broken,
 but I think it'll be fixed.
 No, in the Lord.
  </li><li>Do you want me to read you the next question, baby?
  </li><li>Please do.
 Read me in your most authoritative army voice.
  </li><li>Alan and AJ, love your podcast.
  </li><li>Okay, I'm scared.
 Just read in your normal voice.
 It says this is from AJ.
 So, A-A-J, it's AJ.
  </li><li>Are you writing to yourself?
  </li><li>I don't think so, I don't remember doing it,
 but it's possible I'm really tired.
  </li><li>Okay, go for it.
  </li><li>So it says Alan and AJ, love your podcast.
 So very much, thank you, that's lovely.
 I have a mashup question, half about dating,
 half about hearing the voice of God.
 I can't wait to read this, this is gonna be very exciting.
 Okay, so, I am a 26 year old female,
 and I have had a series of emotionally intense,
 long relationships all ended somewhat tragically
 except for my last one,
 which was my first healthy God honoring breakup.
 I do not come from the healthiest family.
 My parents are divorced and every man in my life,
 except for my grandfather who is passionately in love
 with Jesus, has cheated on every woman of influence
 in my life.
 Wow.
 Yeah, I usually pick guys who lose interest in me and disappear
 Until I become exhausted making the relationship run all by myself and then break it off for them
 Because it's too painful to keep going
 So over the years it's created a lot of self-esteem issues that I am always seeking more and more healing for
 I've been in counseling and spent a year away
 from dating to really work on my stuff.
 But lately I've considered possibly dating again
 and I am very, very afraid,
 primarily because I do believe I hear the voice
 of the Holy Spirit,
 but there are lots of inconsistencies.
 I also can never hear the voice of the Holy Spirit
 when I'm dating someone.
 It's like there's a weird barricade or a block up.
 So I've developed this unhealthy belief
 that dating is bad or dirty or wrong,
 and the Lord wants me to be alone,
 or I'm just not healthy enough to date
 despite all my hard self-work.
 The trouble is, I have this resentment in my heart
 building up towards the Lord because it's like
 there's this lie that the Lord prefers me to be alone,
 stitched into my being, or maybe it's true.
 Maybe I'm called to be single.
 Honestly, that would be okay with me.
 dating is scary and hard.
 I wish that I could date and invite the Lord into it,
 but I'm hitting a wall.
 It could be indicative of wrong timing
 or maybe just some UGBs, which is ungodly beliefs.
 I would love to know your thoughts on this.
 And if you have any advice about walking into dating
 in a healthy God-honoring way as a mid-20 something.
  </li><li>That is a great question.
 Thank you for sharing a little bit of your story, AJ.
 Certainly sounds very painful.
 I'm really sorry it's been your experience with men
 and really sorry that's been your experience
 with relationships.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>There are probably a whole host of things
 that is contributing to your feelings.
 And of course, without knowing you
 and without being in dialogue with you,
 a lot of the input, AJ and I are gonna give you,
 is more general than specific to your circumstances.
 One of the things I would encourage you to do
 before anything else is to set aside some time
 and set aside some money to do what we call
 restoring the foundations healing week.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>This has got to be one of the best investments
 anybody could make in their life.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>It is where you as a single person will go to
 two counselors to RTF trained counselors,
 typically a husband and wife.
 And you will be with them for three or four days,
 depending on the schedule.
 And they will minister to you in four key areas.
 Like some of the things that instantly grab my attention
 is what you said about your family line,
 that basically your whole family line
 has come from broken relationships.
 So automatically that tells me
 there's something over your family line
 that the enemy really doesn't want great, healthy relationships.
 And you battling that without that getting taken care of,
 it's gonna be like pushing water uphill with a rake.
 It's gonna get real tired really a long time.
 But the good news is Jesus can fix that brilliantly.
 And so going for an RTF week,
 they'll probably instantly go after that.
 The second thing I hear in your questions
 are a whole load of ungodly beliefs.
 Yeah. That are either fully formed or are blossoming.
 Things like, I can't hear the Holy Spirit when I'm in relationships.
 So we'd call that an ungodly belief because that might be true based on the facts of your
 experience, but it's false based on the teaching of the Word of God.
 Because there's nowhere in Scripture that says, I will never leave you.
 I'll never forsake you, except when you're in a relationship or my sheep know my voice.
 They follow me unless they're dating.
 But also it is really hard to hear the learn
 on things that are super close to your heart.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>Especially if you've made it an idol of some sort.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>So it could be more that.
 Like it really could just be.
  </li><li>There could be a number of things
 that are contributing to that.
 But the encouraging thing is on this healing week,
 they'll dismantle anything that's clouding
 your judgment and your ability.
 And I should say when I say that I'm hearing
 on Godly beliefs, I'm not telling you
 you're doing something wrong,
 Nor am I necessarily right in that assessment.
 Again, I'm just going based on my experience of walking with people.
 This is what you usually find.
 So well done on having the self awareness to realize, Oh, this has been a
 parent in my relationships.
 Well done for realizing, Oh, this is where I'm taking responsibility or I can see
 where I've exercised control or, I mean, these are great steps in, in self growth.
 but I would really, really encourage you to seek out some time to reward yourself, to be kind to yourself,
 to do an RTFL, do way more for you than just helping with relationships.
 But I want to encourage you that you are a person that is full of value and well worth investing.
 And before you can have an expectation that other people are going to invest in you,
 I would encourage you in investing in yourself.
 And that's why I think you're healing would be great. What do you think, babe?
 No, I think that's great. I definitely think a healing week would probably help. I think,
 you know, you say at one point in your question, I wonder if God called me to be single. I think
 of God had called you to be single. That's what you'd want to be. And I know at one point you say,
 well, that would be fine because dating is scary, but fear isn't the reason that you want to be
 single. So, you know, I think that if the meditation of your heart is, hey, actually, I'd like to be
 be married. I like to have kids. I'd like to, you know, go through that whole process.
 And that sounds like a horribly clinical way to put it. It's a great process. I've enjoyed
 the process myself. And I would say then God hasn't called you to be single because he
 would, he understands the desires of your heart.
 I wonder if it's not as simple as that though. Okay. I think that that God, of course, does
 work with the desires of your heart. But sometimes we don't know what the desires of
 our horror. But I would agree with you that God is so good at telling you what his desires are.
 He doesn't leave you in murkiness. He doesn't leave you to flounder around and vaguely stumble
 upon his will. He would speak to you. But he's also not going to let fear be your motivator for
 the reason that you choose not to be. No, no, I think your point was brilliant. Your second
 point was brilliant about God's not going to use fear as the motivator for you following him.
 you know, he's going to use life. And anyway, my point rather was, I know lots of people whose
 desire is to be married, but they're not married. And so the desire is there. And it hasn't happened
 for them. So obviously, one of the places their head goes to is, well, maybe God wants me to be
 be single. But again, I doesn't God communicate, God's a much better communicator than just passively
 not answering your will and hoping you figure it out. I think that he would, at least in my experience,
 the things that God wants me to do, he's come and spoken to me like a friend and said, "Hey,
 this is something I'd love you to do." Yeah. And we know people as well that are single,
 that feel like the Lord's talked to them about being single and their content with that. And it's
 not because of being afraid, but simply because they feel like that's what the Lord spoke to them
 about. So, yeah, there's peace when God speaks.
 So advice on entering into dating as a mid-20s, somebody would be, get your heart healed.
 And I'm not saying that because I think you're a mess. I'm saying you're doing a great job in
 heading towards- I mean, you're clearly going after your stuff, which is amazing.
 I'd say invite counsel from people. So, I'd love that you asked us that question,
 but find people who are actually in relationship with you who know you and give them permission to
 speak into that. And maybe pick a person that's different from the people that you've been picking
 in the past. Like you mentioned earlier that I always go for the same type of guy.
 Well, your track record would suggest that's not working for you. So maybe have a different
 thought about that. Yeah, if you have some safe spiritual authority, you know, that are,
 you know safe people and have to sermon and stuff maybe get them involved in the process with you you know like if somebody.
 Says that they want to date you maybe get them to have a pass at that person.
 I'm if your track record has been you know picking the wrong kind of guy.
 Let them know that hey i have this track record i'm trying not to do this again would you would you be part of this scenario with me.
 I don't know if AJ you've listened to our teaching on relationships. We have a teaching
 all about sexual wholeness on our website at alm&amp;ag.com and part of that is a teaching that we do on
 dating. If you've not heard it, you could listen to that. It has a fuller expression on our views
 on dating and hopefully there's something that is helpful. AJ Jones, tell me what we need to know
 before we go.
 The Heaven Declares Conference is coming up late October and we have Life Hatland coming
 in, Jamie Galloway and Andy Squire's leading worship, so we're super excited.
 We can't wait for that.
 No, it's going to be great.
 We're going to post a link in our YouTube.
 If you haven't heard Life Hatland, I'm going to post a link to Randy Clark, who you've probably
 heard of, talking about Life Hatland and we're just so excited to have Life at our church.
 And of course, Jamie is a good friend of ours.
 We're going to be thrilled to have him back.
 Yeah.
 And Andy Squires, I hear great things about, I've never met Andy, but everybody who has
 says he's amazing.
 We were out of town when he came and led worship.
 So we're excited about that.
 I can't wait.
 Hope you guys have an incredible week.
 If you would like one of your questions answered, go to Alan and AJ.com/ask.
