<p> I live in a j's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Jones is a john's were back.
 Yes, we are.<br/>
 I'm back from fighting sickness like a warrior.
 OK, sure.<br/>
 He's sleeping warrior, a bedridden warrior.
 Yeah, I'm sorry.<br/>
 There was no podcast last week.<br/>
 I only miss podcasting and we tried to do something fun with the kids, didn't we?
 We did.<br/>
 But what was the problem?<br/>
 The problem was they're all quite fascinated, which makes sense
 with the sound of their own voice in their ears.
 Right.<br/>
 And so in previous years, what we've done is we've had them in the studio one at a time.
 Oh, really?<br/>
 And then we mixed them all together to make it sound like they're all in the room together.
 You feel the enthusiasm, put all of them in the studio and just hit record.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And then handed it to me like, hey, edit this and make it sound good.
 There's going to be something you can pull out of it.
 There was lots of cute little bits.<br/>
 Weather was, but they weren't facing into the microphone or MJ was just going, hello.
 Over and over again.<br/>
 It's like, fascinated with the sound of his voice.
 He gets so excited after he said hello.
 So it was going to be highly amusing, but it didn't work.
 I'm so sorry.<br/>
 And then I was sick as a dog.<br/>
 I was sick for five days.<br/>
 I think it was more like six days.<br/>
 Were you worried about me at all?<br/>
 No.<br/>
 Why? Just because you knew my resilience.
 No.<br/>
 Why were you not worried?<br/>
 Um, well, because you had no time.<br/>
 I, yeah, I was too busy running around like a headless chicken.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 What was it?<br/>
 You say it was called viral laryngitis.
 Well, I thought it was intense man flu.
 I, I don't, I didn't come up with viral laryngitis.
 My doctor told me that.<br/>
 So I went to see my GP twice.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 The second time, because you thought they didn't do it properly.
 Well, I was advised that there was the potential that you hadn't been swapped
 correctly.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 And so I thought, oh, and because another friend of ours said that their
 uncle had died of strep throat.<br/>
 I was like, oh, maybe you should get swapped again.
 Right.<br/>
 You know that I'm, I am not the type of person who's like, I'll just rough it out.
 The first day that my throat was sore, I was like, because what typically happens
 is I'll be like, oh, no, I'm fine.<br/>
 I'm fine.<br/>
 I'm fine.<br/>
 And then eventually I get an auto on my back.
 and then I go to the doctor. I just thought, "No, I'm going to go straight to the doctor.
 If this is strep throat, we'll just get antibiotics. We'll knock it out. Even though I hate taking
 antibiotics, that's what we'll do." But they swabbed me negative for that. Then they took
 my blood and said, "Let's test it for mono." And I was negative for that. And they just
 said, "I'm sorry, it's just some viral laryngitis, which is a partial way of saying you have a
 sore throat, but it sounds much more cooler if I say." Yeah, it really does.
 Viral laryngitis. Yeah, I had viral laryngitis.
 So I stayed in bed for five days. You did exhausted. And God bless you. You just ran everything. I did the ministry of the house. Yes. Yes.
 I see some of the conference all that stuff. I missed all of the conference. You did. I was so excited about having declares. I got to none of the sessions. I know. I didn't get to meet anybody.
 It's very sad. I was Alan Namates as they would say in Scotland. Alan Namates. Yeah, no friends.
 "Naymates, gotcha."<br/>
 -Just on my toad.<br/>
 -On your toad.<br/>
 -On my own.<br/>
 -That's on your toad.<br/>
 -Nope.<br/>
 -By yourself on a toad stew.<br/>
 [laughter]<br/>
 -That's fantastic.<br/>
 And then I was supposed to be teaching last week at school,
 but still hadn't recovered, so you taught.
 -That's right.<br/>
 You just dropped me right in the middle of it.
 -I did.<br/>
 And then bless you.<br/>
 You weren't sick, but Wednesday morning you woke up,
 and we're just like, I'm not coming to work today.
 And I was like, are you sick?<br/>
 you were like, "No, I think I've just worked
 12 days in a row without a break."
</p><ul>
  <li>Well, I had worked 12 days in a row without a break,
 but I thought I was sick.
 Like I woke up and I literally felt like,
 "Oh my gosh, if I've been hit by a truck,
 "I think I'm not okay.
 "I felt dizzy.
 "I felt just totally wonky."
 So I crawled back into bed and you put the kitties on the bus
 and went about your day and I did not wake up
 until 12, 30 in the afternoon.
  </li><li>Is there any sense in which you think you had
 same thing as me, but because you're a powerful, resilient woman, what took me five, six days
 to recover, took you one day to recover? Is there a subtle undertone?
 Well, technically that would be like four hours, but no, I don't think women can get
 man flu, even intense men flu. Oh, baby. Sorry, I'm just kidding. No, I don't think I had
 the same thing as you.
 That's what I want to hear. Yeah.
 So I bounced back about what Wednesday, Tuesday? No, Tuesday, I went into work.
 Wednesday. I don't even remember Wednesday, Thursday, Wednesday. I stayed home and stayed
 in bed until seven. Thursday, we both worked.
 Yeah, busy, busy, busy, busy. Yeah. Just lots of meetings and things like that.
 We didn't even get to Connectal Friday. And we realized it had been 10 days like ships
 in the night, which produces some interesting fruit in relationships, doesn't it?
 Yeah, I don't think it produces good fruit.
 Oh, produces the sourest of fruit.
 I honestly don't know how marriages survive when the when one of the spouses travels a lot,
 other than they must be very good at communicating.
 Right.
 Because just even being super busy and kind of missing each other and you know,
 you being asleep or me being asleep and all that kind of stuff just felt like by the time we got
 to Friday was like, well, we didn't even have time to catch each other.
 up on the week. Well, there's nothing for me to catch you up on. I was like, "Ah, the
 ceiling is still there." But you had to fill me in on a bunch of stuff at work that we
 just didn't have time to do that because, bless you, you were running around doing everything.
 Yeah. But it was horrible. Reentry back into, "Oh, you're my wife. Do you remember me? I'm
 your husband." That we should probably try eating meals together. So Friday night, we fixed
 all that by having a date. We did. And we didn't look at our cell phones the whole time we were
 on the date. Almost the whole time.
 Well, we looked at our Apple watches to see if it was a babysitter.
 Yeah.
 But it took us a couple of days to reconnect, didn't it?
 It did.
 It did.
 It did feel like a crazy week of just, yeah, no time for us.
 Well, we'll talk about that in the, our main topic for this week is all about catching up on what we've missed in the last two weeks.
 So we'll talk about that a little bit more.
 MJ's birthday party.
 Do you want to talk about that?
 We had it at Monkey Joes and there was lots of squealing, jumping, more squealing.
 Yeah, it was really loud, but it was great because we didn't have it here.
 We didn't have to either tidy it before or afterwards or come up with
 a plan to entertain a bunch of kids for two hours rotating activities every 10 minutes.
 right instead of just getting sugar and put them into bouncy castles.
 That's right.
 It's perfect.
 And then apologize to parents.
 So sorry.
 Run along kids.
 Yeah, so it was good.
 I mean, he loved it.
 I had a thought earlier today.
 Yeah.
 Well, I was raised with three sisters.
 And my father was not a very.
 Outgoing athletic person.
 And I'm not a very outgoing and athletic person, but I wondered what
 kind of boy I would have been if I had a father who loved outdoors and sports and
 and I'm just wondering if MJ is getting enough man. We've often joked that if MJ wants to get into
 sports we're going to need all my friends to coach him in like basketball and baseball and football.
 And then there's others outdoor sporting things. So I know nothing about them but I thought it was
 so funny watching him in his element. I mean of course it was his birthday so he was hyper but
 but he was running around. He was as loud as could be,
 louder than we would let him be in the house.
 I wonder if we're crushing that little emerging noisy boy
 because...
 Do you know what I'm saying?
 Yeah.
 What do you think about that?
 I don't... I mean, I don't know.
 It's not like we're constantly telling him to be quiet.
 He doesn't seem to be that loud.
 Yeah, but I'm wondering if he would be if he wasn't surrounded.
 What would he be like if he had a brother, for example?
 Oh, well, hard to say, but I know that like when he's with the other kids at preschool or whatever, that he's definitely a louder version.
 So parents of other boys, let us know your thoughts on that because we only have one and we're not sure if we're raising him right.
 We're raising him with two girls.
 Yeah.
 Maybe he's just going to be a more sensitive version.
 Who knows?
 Anyways, the first time I thought about it today and I thought, huh, I should probably fall up on that thought.
 All right, let's move from meandering through our week to meandering into what I missed in our week.
 This is the catch up episode mainly for my benefit and everybody else gets to listen in.
 Talk to me about having declares. What did I miss?
 Wow, it was really good. Really enjoyed Andy Squires and him leading worship and just.
 He flows so well with the Holy Spirit and it just was really fun.
 to watch. And yeah, I just really enjoyed him.
 I'm super bummed that he's been here twice and I missed him both
 times. Yeah, it's a bummer. Yeah, it was really good. All right.
 How's life? Hadland? We've heard life before. Yeah, I haven't
 heard him in years. Yeah, I hadn't heard life in probably 10
 years or so. Really? Yeah, I would think so. What was his
 message then? Primarily his message was sonship. You know,
 He spent all weekend referring back to three chairs and saying, you know, there's chair number one,
 chair number two, and chair number three. And chair number three is the world. It's the Muslims,
 the Buddhists, the loss, the searching, the new age, or the, you know, that that's the world. And
 you're, and we as Christians are either going to view them from chair number one, which is sunship,
 or chair number two, which is really more orphan thinking. So, you know, chair number two being
 more threatened by the world, less concerned with helping them, more concerned with judging
 them, that sort of stuff. And chair number one, being fully seated in a sonship, having
 the father's perspective of people that are lost in dying. So, but he, all the way through
 teaching all weekend long kept referring back to sitting in chair number one. And basically
 what we would teach as sonship.
 I just heard amazing things about...
 It was really good.
 It was really, really good.
 And life as a person as well.
 Like people who got the time with him were just saying,
 he's super present, super peaceful.
 I love that.
 He's not trying to impress anyone or, you know,
 you just think, here's a guy who's led a million Muslims
 to the Lord and, you know, like, just has seen astronomical
 things and he's not, he's not downloading his resume to you and he's talking to you.
 You know, he's just in the room.
 And even in moments when it could sound like he's downloading his resume because
 he doesn't have that feel about him.
 It feels more like he's celebrating what God has done through his life than
 celebrating himself.
 Wow.
 So yeah, good.
 And then Jamie Galloway, who we've gone to none the last couple of years.
 Yeah.
 It's just.
 Tremendous fun.
 Yeah.
 I was Jamie.
 Oh, I love Jamie.
 He was good.
 He, you know, he of course spoke.
 He also ministered prophetically and so he'd sort of walk through the room at the beginning
 and pick out a few people and prophesy over them.
 And then at the end of the service, he'd do the same thing.
 He'd walk through and speak over some people and stuff.
 So it just gave some really cool words.
 It was quite fun.
 It was quite fun to watch.
 I mean, a lot of the people, because it's a conference, you don't know everybody.
 Right.
 hard to know like, you know, who's who and is what he's saying is that hitting the mark,
 you know, a couple of the people that he picked out we did know quite well and it was awesome.
 So that was always, it's always fun to watch that, like to watch people get blessed and
 he reminds me a little bit of Gary not necessarily the way he prophesies but in his
 zest for life. Just this child like zeal, child like zeal and pure joy. I mean, he feels like he'd
 be up for anything anytime. Yeah. All was enthusiastic, all was excited. Yeah. And yeah, love that guy.
 And then Emily and the kids were here too, which was really fun. Yeah, I got a little bit of time
 with them. And of course, MJ was thrilled to get time with Benjamin. And so it was good. It was
 really fun. Wow, it looked great. I got to tune in on a couple of times and watch the
 live stream and it looked amazing. I'm just totally bummed I missed it. If if enemies
 listening and they want mp3 from the conference, you can get them at graceinner.us. That just
 sounds like an amazing conference. I'm looking forward to listening to them.
 You then covered for me at the school. Yeah. I was supposed to be teaching on sexual wholeness.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Didn't get to.
  </li><li>No, I mean, you weren't well yet, so.
  </li><li>So instead, you came in and you taught on intimacy.
  </li><li>Yeah, we just swapped weeks.
 I mean, I was scheduled to teach this week,
 so we just brought it forward.
  </li><li>And then you taught from the song Songs.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And so when I went in on Tuesday
 and just kind of cut out with people,
 how was it?
 Apparently, it was amazing.
 Apparently, we had some students
 who were just a mess and tears sobbing.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>I spoke to one student today and they said,
 Aside from the revelation that God is doing miraculous things today,
 I would say the revelation I got from Intimacy Week was the largest revelation I've ever had.
 It's up there with God doing the miraculous, which I didn't know about.
 And so they were just astonished. So talk us through what you do on that week.
 I start by talking about hindrances to pursuing intimacy, so things that would hold us back from
 actually being intimate with the Lord or having that kind of relationship. So even if in our hearts,
 we're saying, gosh, I really want to have this intimate relationship. I want to hear his voice.
 I want to be really close. There's things that we allow or give place to that actually keep that
 from happening. Things like perfectionism or busyness or shame, things like that. We
 go through a bunch of those things and break agreement with them and ask the lawyer to
 come and speak into different areas. Then speak about keys to connection, both horizontal
 and vertical and that sort of thing.
 And then in the afternoon, we spend time just talking about, "Okay, you hear people say
 they spend time with the Lord.
 What does that look like?
 What can it look like?
 What typically do people do when they're having a God time?
 How can you form a regular pattern of having a God time?"
 All that kind of stuff.
 So I just answer a bunch of questions that have actually sitting down a number of years
 ago with a whole bunch of different people and saying, when you spend time with God,
 what does it look like? And there's so much freedom in that.
 Because they were all different. I mean, these are, you know,
 generals of the faith, if you will, and they're all doing different things. I mean,
 some things are consistent, but other things are like, oh, wow, you go for a run and talk to the
 Lord while you're running, you know, or, right. You know, or, you know, so different things
 like that. So I was like, oh, so I just sort of passed along all the information that I
 had gathered in order to bring some freedom and having a relationship with the Lord without
 punching a time clock with God. And then teach them how to pray the Bible, all that kind of stuff.
 And then on Tuesday, we go first. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, you just
 classed over, I teach them how to pray the Bible. What's that about?
 That's actually a teaching from Wesley Campbell in BC.
 He's from BC.
 And-From 
 before Christ.
 British Columbia.
 Oh, I see.
 And it's a teaching where basically it teaches you
 how to pray.
 So it's things like set a time, learn the language, picture,
 God.
 So things like turning to the passages,
 like the Theophanes and that kind of stuff,
 and having an idea of what's actually going on in heaven.
 And then learning the languages, pray scripture, basically.
 And then pray standing or pacing and pray out loud.
 So those are his five keys to learning how to pray.
 So we talk about all those and then we actually do it.
 So I would say I don't do all those.
 I do some of those, but I would say the greatest move forward in my prayer
 life is when I started praying out loud.
 Same.
 Or when I started writing out my prayers, like most of the time when I'm journaling with
 the Lord, when I'm talking to Him, I'm writing down what I'm saying.
 But before I ever learned that, just praying out loud made the world a difference to my
 prayer life.
 So I'll throw that out for free.
 Yeah, it's great.
 And then on the Tuesday, for the whole morning we go verse by verse to the song of Solomon.
 Now you have an interesting history with the song of Solomon.
 I do.
 You once upon a time loathe that book.
 I just despised it. I just.
 That's for the strong language for the word of God.
 But why didn't you like it?
 I know. Well, some of it was the language. Some of it was like there was,
 you know, there were some people I knew that were totally into the Song of Solomon.
 And usually those weren't the same kind of people as me, if that makes sense.
 There were a type of people who would wear wedding dresses for the bride and cries
 coke. Yeah, that kind of stuff. You know, always talking about,
 "Oh, isn't Jesus dreamy?
 Kisses me with the kisses of..."
 And I was just like, "What are you talking about?"
 It just all seemed very...
  </li><li>Art is he farted at her very...
  </li><li>Yes, and I know you like to wear pink and ruffles and stuff,
 but you can have the song of Solomon
 and I'll take anything Paul wrote.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>It's just like...
  </li><li>No judgments.
  </li><li>Of course, a whole bunch of judgments,
 just laden with judgments.
 And then in addition, it's like, you'd read stuff like,
 "Oh, your teeth are like little sheep and your hair is like a flock of goats."
 And I'm like, "Gosh, is that a compliment?"
 Like this, you know, I just didn't get it.
 So yeah.
 But the Lord took you to it one day, didn't he?
 He did.
 Yeah.
 And now it's one of your favorite books.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 And you have a teaching that I have never heard anybody else teach on song songs.
 Yeah.
 And I love when you teach it.
 And not unfortunately, but in order for you to teach it well, you really do teach every single verse of the whole book.
 Yes.
 And then the revelation you bring forth has elicited gasps from your audiences all over the world.
 Yes.
 Which is fun.
 I know.
 I mean, I've been trying to write it into a book and I've started twice and it hasn't been circulated into anything.
 Metriculated?
 Is that a word?
 Did I just make up a word?
 a couple of different.
  </li><li>Metriculate is something you do when you go to university.
 That is a word.
  </li><li>Okay, it hasn't articulated.
  </li><li>I don't know.
 It's not a book yet.
 So I mean, I know I need to restart that.
  </li><li>What's it like taking a room for the people through a book, verse by verse?
  </li><li>It's equally fun and slightly stressful.
 Like it's fun.
 I know the book really well.
 I like the song of Solomon.
 I've read it in every version.
 But it's also probably the most disagreed upon
 book in the entire Bible and scholars argue about it
 and every commentary has something different to say about it.
 So I kind of start by saying,
 "Hey guys, I'm not the sole authority on this.
 "I might be able to answer questions.
 "I might not, I might have opinions that are different
 "than yours, that's fine."
 But let's look at it together.
 'Cause I think that's the only way I can approach it
 with integrity because I think, you know,
 greater people than me have tried to do it.
  </li><li>Well, what I also love,
 I've listened to you teach it many times
 and I love that you don't have an axe to grind.
 So people will often stand up
 and which is what you want in that context
 because you're doing, you know, like a group discussion.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But people will often stand up with like a very strong
 willed like, well, I think this means this.
 And you're like, oh, okay, good.
 You don't feel the need to defend your view of it.
 You're like, oh, there's so many different ways
 of looking at this that's fine.
 Here's why I personally don't think that.
 Or, oh, that's good.
 I'll chew on that.
 And that's really refreshing
 rather than people dogmatically saying,
 this is what it means.
  </li><li>Yeah, and it's quite fun too,
 'cause sometimes people will highlight things
 that actually, even though I've read the song,
 gosh, I don't know how many times at this point,
 hundreds of times,
 I never noticed that.
 So they'll point out something or they'll say, hey, in my Bible and the side section,
 it says that means this or whatever.
 And you just kind of go, oh, well gosh, that's great.
 That makes a lot of sense actually.
 And so just talk about that for a little bit.
 So I find that part really, really fun.
 Well, I heard our students go right.
 Good.
 I've watched grown men run out of the room in tears while you're teaching that because they're
 so moved by God's heart for them. Yeah. That's really where to go.
 Thanks. I think that the end revelation that, of course, we're not talking about because it would
 just take too long to talk about it is just super impacting in terms of what it means for us.
 So I think that there's a lot of freedom that comes from it as well.
 So good.
 So from intimacy to complete disconnection, that's less than interesting segue.
 So while you were away teaching, basically carrying the slack that I'd caused by being sick,
 we were naturally completely disconnected.
 We, I mean, you would get up, get the kids ready.
 I was fast asleep.
 I would sleep all day.
 You would come in at night.
 You would be dog tired.
 You'd just go straight to bed.
 We wouldn't really have any talking time at all.
 And after about a week of this, I'm back up on my feet.
 We're trying to reconnect.
 I don't think we were ready for how disconnected we felt.
 Like relationally, emotionally, physically, it was just like, what's going on?
 Yeah.
 And so we had this interest in revelation, didn't we?
 We did.
 By interest in revelation, I mean, we had a big argument and then we saw it out.
 Yes.
 But this is like how are you going to freeze our interesting revelation because to me,
 I remember it's not in tears, but okay.
 Well, basically the premise is what we realized is our marriage, I think marriage is period
 worked really, really well when it is erased out serving one another.
 Yeah, that's what Chip Judd used to say, isn't it?
 Yeah, make your marriage a game where you see who can out serve one another.
 And I think our marriage is at its best when we're both giving towards it
 sacrificially with joy.
 Yeah.
 It's not that I'm demanding things from you to be sacrificial.
 It's that you're willingly, cheerfully giving towards the marriage
 sacrificially.
 And what I mean by that is, or I'll take it from my side, that I'm doing
 things towards the marriage that's above and beyond what's asked.
 And there's a joy in that.
 You're just like, I just love my wife as Christ.
 love the church and you're making huge allowances for the other person's "weaknesses" and
 now weaknesses, I mean they're doing things the way that you wouldn't do or they're doing
 things slower than the way you would like it or you're going above and beyond the extra
 mile, all that sort of stuff.
 Or they're prioritizing a different order of things than you would or whatever, yeah.
 Or you're serving them in areas you might not be interested in doing.
 And we've talked about that in past podcasts.
 talked about. Actually, if you want more information about the importance of connection,
 episodes 165 and 95, we talked a little bit about this. I won't belabor it. But what we realized
 in order for that to happen, there has to be huge levels of grace. So there has to be a ton of grace
 going. There has to be lots of sleep and eating well and energy. Because if you're hungry, if you're
 angry if you're lonely, if you're tired, basically the grace tends to vanish.
 And that's basically what happened over a week of us not seeing each other, you being
 busy, me being tired.
 We, we, so we ran out of grace for each other, but things that we would normally be cheerful
 and happy about, we were grumpy.
 Well, we weren't clocking any time with one another.
 So there was then nothing to withdraw from, there was no.
 Right.
 Love tanks totally on empty.
 what we realized is when that happens, we move from giving sacrificially to coming into
 agreement with the accuser of the brethren and realizing, "My needs are not being met,"
 and then start demanding that our needs are met.
 Then all you do is like, "Are you kidding me?"
 Yeah, or giving big grudgingly and mumbling and complaining the whole time that you're
 doing anything.
 Right.
 Which is not produced great fruit at all.
 and on a negativity fast it's hard to get away with that.
 Totally.
 Yeah.
 And so what we realized is like, oh, oh, we're totally disconnected from one another.
 Yeah.
 Oh, we've had no quality time whatsoever together.
 Yeah.
 We're just not even on the same page.
 Yeah.
 And so, because we were in this heat discussion and then suddenly the heat,
 the heat vanished and it felt like we had clarity.
 Do you remember why that was?
 I don't.
 Neither do I.
 It's just Jesus.
 But probably.
 Well, I think what we realized is that both our frustrations stem from the same point, but from different sides.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And we both realized, oh, actually, we're both quite good at loving each other.
 And we've just momentarily forgotten that.
 Yeah.
 I'm not sure what our point was other than.
 Yeah.
 It was that kind of a day.
 It was that kind of a day.
 It was, but that was short lived and so it was fine.
 Yeah, that was what happened our other day.
 Yeah, I didn't like that half an hour.
 No, it wasn't a great half an hour.
 But my eyes were puffy this morning.
 Oh, from crying?
 Yeah.
 Yesterday?
 Yeah.
 Yeah, but look how good you feel now.
 I do, and my eyes are not puffy anymore.
 So there you go.
 That's our catch up for the week.
 I hope somebody got something out of that.
 One can only hope.
 Well, I feel like I'm caught up on the conference.
 Oh, my shoulder had healed this morning.
 Oh, talk about that.
 Well, Jeff, while he was speaking during second service, he, during worship said, "Oh, I have
 this picture of everybody standing inside the sanctuary with their backs to the walls,
 those people that need any kind of healing."
 And I was like, "Oh, okay, cool."
 He's like, "So we're probably going to do that.
 Am I cool?"
 And then Becky had a picture of oil running down the walls of the sanctuary.
 And so...
 that all the time in our church. All the time. Oil's running down there. All that's passing.
 And then, so Jeff, you know, he read some scripture verses and stuff like that. It was
 really encouraging people to connect with the Lord. And then he was like, you know, if you need
 healing your body, why don't you stand around the outside? And I wasn't going to go. Like,
 I was just sort of like, well, you know, I can, I can handle most of what I have to deal with in
 terms of what I'd like healed from. I'm not, I'm not desperately sick with anything. I just have
 some areas of pain. And then I thought, you know what? No, I'm I'm going to go. Like I'm going to go
 standing at the wall. And so I stood against the wall and I guess a couple different people prayed
 for me still don't I don't you know, I have my eyes shut. I don't know who prayed for me. And
 then I thought, I felt like the Lord said, Hey, try out your shoulder. Well, I so I went out in the
 hallway to do that because I'd have to wave my arms around like a maniac. Right. And I have
 what feels like almost full range of motion in my right shoulder now, which I didn't have.
 That's incredible. Yeah. So there's one, I still have full range of motion. There's one
 movement that I can't do with getting my arm fully behind my back like I used to be able to do.
 But other than that, it's, and it doesn't even feel stiff. Like it's the best it has felt in
 probably a year and a half or two years. You need Jesus. Yeah. So I heard a bunch of
 test means of people can heal this morning.
 Yeah, it was really great.
 I'll tell you what was also really great.
 It was worship this morning.
 Yeah, it was fantastic.
 Oh my gosh.
 It was incredible.
 The whole time in worship was just amazing.
 Yeah, live stream worship from November 6th.
 I'll put a link in the show notes.
 The worship was just absolutely incredible.
 Way to go Hope's troop.
 So good.
 Not at the park.
 Yeah.
 It was incredible.
 Yeah.
 And you know what?
 Another thing is our tech team led by Marcus Hendrix
 do a phenomenal job. Yeah, they do. Like this, the mix this morning was absolutely unbelievable.
 Yeah. I was just like, come on. That's ridiculous. All right, you ready for a listening question?
 Yep. This is from Jill. Mm-hmm. This is straight up your street. I'm expecting a brilliant answer
 for you. Oh, okay, the pressure. Okay. My husband and I have been married two years and are nine
 weeks out from welcoming our first baby into the world. Congratulations. And of course,
 are so excited. It's a whole new adventure. We also realize that we will face many changes
 in the days to come. I would love to hear your thoughts on how kids change your marriage
 and how to keep your marriage in a healthy place when raising your family in addition to
 balancing work and being pastors on top of that. We know our marriage will change but we want to
 see it grow stronger and stay in love with each other instead of seeing distance grow between us
 as we've seen so many others experience. Thank you so much for your insight. We thank you guys
 of the best.
 Thank you.
 Well, gosh, I think there's a couple different things you can do.
 One, prioritizing your marriage looks like something.
 So there's practical things that you can do to help that desire be a reality going forward.
 So even things like if you can pick a regular night of the week, that is your date night,
 that is, doesn't get booked over top of or whatever.
 which that sounds so cliche-ed in Christian,
 but it's absolutely fantastic.
  </li><li>It is fantastic.
 You know, my aunt and uncle,
 I don't know how long they've been married for at this point,
 gotta be 40 or 50 years.
 I'm trying to think,
 I guess they probably closer to 40 years
 that they've been married.
 They have date night every Tuesday night.
 They have eight children,
 and they've been married for decades,
 and they still have a date night every single Tuesday night.
 And I think that's probably why they're married 40 years later, you know, because they're even
 with eight kids, this was something they were going to prioritize.
 I'm surprised that the first thing that you said was prioritizing the marriage and not
 baby wise.
 Well, I was going to say baby wise next because the question seemed to be more about prioritizing
 your marriage.
 But the thing is, is I think baby wise helps you do that.
 In order to prioritize your marriage, you have to be a normal functioning human.
 You have to be able to sleep.
 In order to be a functioning human, you have to have sleep.
 In order to be able to sleep, we highly recommend baby wise.
 Baby wise, yeah.
 That may be controversial to some people.
 I'm sure it is.
 But baby wise made it possible for us to have kids and to stay happy, I think.
 And stay sane.
 And stay sane.
 Like we, you know, whether it was, you know, Abigail with our first or, you know, like
 Abby, we flew all over the world with her.
 And because of baby-wise, because of having her on a schedule and because of, you know...
 Well, explain what baby-wise is.
 So, baby-wise is a book that's called "On Becoming Baby-Wise."
 I think the author is, his last name is Enzo.
 There's two authors.
 There's a link in the show notes.
 They're a Christian pediatrician and a Christian child psychologist who wrote it.
 And so they talk about a number of different things.
 their first chapter in the book is about the importance of your marriage and why your marriage
 sets the best healthy marriage sets the best backdrop for any child growing up, which I totally
 dream. And then it talks a lot about the physical end of a baby. What is a baby experiencing?
 Which end of the baby? All ends of the baby. Both the smelly end and the cute smiley end.
  </li><li>It's the noisy end.
  </li><li>The noisy end, yeah.
 So it talks about scheduling.
 Basically it's talking about how to get your child
 on a schedule.
 And there's a bunch of reasons for that.
 One, if your child is on a regular sleeping schedule,
 they'll be on a regular eating schedule.
 And first of all, they start sleeping through the night
 a lot faster, but they're also happy.
 Like kids that get enough sleep are happy.
 And when they don't get enough sleep,
 They're crying and I don't think enough sleep are happier than adults that don't get enough
 sleep.
 Right.
 But I think most people, where a lot of people don't realize just how much sleep little tiny
 kids need.
 Right.
 They need a lot of sleep.
 Or grown men with viral laryngeitis.
 Right.
 I mean, I mean, that's even worse right there.
 So the book talks about both like the physical stuff that happens and why scheduling is better
 for their body, physically speaking from a medical perspective, but also talks about
 the psychology of all of that kind of stuff.
 So it is great.
 It's not Dr. Spock's stuff.
 It's not detached from your child and don't care about them.
 The idea is youWhich 
 there's a whole of fear mongering that it is.
 Yeah, I know.
 Having done it with all three of our children.
 Right.
 Our children are far from the tech.
 I mean, I've read websites about baby wise and I'm thinking,
 did you read the book?
 Right.
 You know, because you, what you're describing here,
 you didn't read the book.
 Cause that's not what they tell you to do.
 Yeah.
 And you're not doing baby wise.
 Right.
 We also have some, you know, we've recommended this over the years to friends.
 And some people say, well, baby wise doesn't work for me.
 And we say, well, what are you doing?
 We're like, Oh no, that's not baby wise.
 That's you inconsistently trying baby wise, but not sticking with.
 Baby wise is kind of an all in thing.
 You either do it or you don't do it.
 You can't do your own version of it
 because then you end up with, you know,
 well, it didn't work for me.
 Well, it didn't work for you
 'cause you didn't actually do it.
 So--
  </li><li>I just love that I'm black and white we are
 about when it comes to baby wise.
  </li><li>Because I see for me, what happened with us
 was when we were pregnant with Abigail,
 we sort of looked around it.
 A lot of the people that we knew that had babies,
 had little kids were further down the line from us.
 And I literally, for the kids that I actually enjoy
 being around, which probably sounds horrible,
 but that were well behaved,
 they weren't grumpy all the time.
 You know, they were normal kids, but you know.
  </li><li>For the parents, they wanted to turn to alcohol
 for the rest of the life.
  </li><li>Right, like they were, you know, the parents
 that looked like they still loved being married,
 they were happy that they had kids,
 They were willing to have three, four, or five kids
 as opposed to, oh, I had one and I can't take it anymore.
 You know that kind of thing.
 Every single one that I was around did baby-wise.
 And the ones, the parents or friends or whatever
 that I had access to that were like, no, one and that's it.
 Or, you know, it was overwhelming,
 it was difficult, but all of them hadn't done it.
 So to me, I'm like, okay, market research.
 I'm gonna try baby-wise.
 Now, in addition to just doing baby wise, when we started traveling, it enabled us because
 of the way baby wise works, because you are the parent deciding when the child is going
 to sleep, because you're the actual adult in the situation.
 I could actually use the schedule and the timing of things to help Abby have absolutely
 no jet lag, even going to Australia.
 We went to Australia and New Zealand three times with her before she turned one, and
 she had no jet lag whatsoever.
 She was on 110 flights, wasn't she?
 She was on 106 flights before she was a year old.
 I exaggerate. I beg your pardon?
 Well, you know, I just want it to be specific.
 But she'd been an 18 nation. She'd been Iceland several times, you know, and
 she just switched over really, really well because she was used to sleeping on a schedule and you can
 make that work for her body in order to help her switch.
 i think the most encouraging advice we got given jail was from some friends of ours john and patrisia buttsma who have like five six kids five or six i can't remember i think maybe when we when a james pregnant with our first child and you don't know anything before you have a kid you really don't.
 I don't mean that a path rising way we just didn't but i remember patricia coming up and patricia just said guys don't listen to anybody with fearful things to say about having kids kids will fit into the life that you have.
 Yeah i thought that's such an encouraging thing to say yeah and i found out to be totally true that kids really do fit into the life that you have.
 And so Jill my encouragement to you and your husband congratulations you've been married for two years.
 You may have even already had the baby if you have that's fantastic let us know give us an address reach out to the email would love to send your baby something congratulations on that but in all honesty your baby will fit into your life just prioritize your life in the baby will follow.
 Yeah. And also read baby wise. Please read baby wise. It's going to help you a lot.
 Yeah, it's kind of funny because obviously, I mean, I love baby wise. I love helping people with
 infants and help, you know, how old was Abby before she started sleeping through the night?
 Well, Abby was six and a half weeks premature.
 And she started sleeping through the night at nine weeks.
 nine weeks, ladies and gentlemen, nine weeks, she started sleeping through the night.
 Yeah. And that's eight hours or more at nine weeks.
 And when did they start going 12 hours a night? Like we'd put them down at seven and they would
 wake up by three months. So by a month later, we'd put them down at seven, sleep, feet around 10,
 and they'd wake up at seven. And to this day, they still sleep seven to seven. Yeah, 12 hours a night.
 Our kids go down at seven. It takes us approximately five minutes to put them to bed.
 Yeah. And that's just making sure that we clean the teeth. Yeah. In the pajamas. Like,
 there's no fuss. There's no trauma. There's no arguments. Today at one thirty, we had guests
 coming over with all the small group leaders over to our house for lunch. And I said to
 MG before everybody arrived, MG has time for your nap. I said, can you just go upstairs,
 get ready for your nap, dial up stairs and saying to give you a kiss, I'm just going to
 sweep the floor. So I go upstairs about five minutes later. He's already gotten self in bed,
 had pulled a duvet over himself.
 And he was just smiling waiting for me to come in and kiss him.
 Yeah.
 I literally walk in and kiss him.
 Good night.
 Turn off the light.
 That was me putting him for his nap.
 And he had to her nap.
 Yeah.
 And he also sleeps 12 hours at night.
 Yeah.
 And I think-I 
 mean, we get lots of sweet comments about our kids.
 And obviously, everybody thinks their kids are awesome.
 And we think our kids are awesome.
 But we get lots of sweet comments about their disposition.
 I think a lot of it is just they get enough sleep.
 I think I think tired kids are miserable kids because when my kids get two hours less sleep because we decided
 that we didn't have to honor, you know, we weren't going to honor the seven o'clock schedule.
 We need to go and do something or hey, let's let them stay up late tonight for fun.
 We pay for it the next day, right?
 You know, so I think they're friendly because they get enough sleep.
 All right. Let's wrap up this bad boy.
 Yeah.
 The school supernatural life applications are open.
 It's open.
 We changed things this year. Normally we don't open up our applications till January,
 but we thought there's no real reason for that. And so they're currently open. So if you would like
 to come and spend eight months with us, and we'd love you to starting next September,
 the applications for the school of supernatural life are now open. Head over to graceenter.us/school
 to find out all about the school, how much it costs, when it starts, all that sort of stuff.
 And more importantly, to start your application, because we'd love to have you join us for eight
 Yeah, come on and be great. We are also super excited because Grace Center is getting ready
 to do something called Project Wow, which is essentially we are redoing the children's
 ministry wing or we're redoing a wing of our building and making it the new children's
 ministry wing. Right. We're renovating how many thousand square feet?
 16,000 square feet just for children. Just for children. And it's going to be themed
 and there's going to be a playroom and all this stuff. It's going to be awesome. It is
 a half a million dollar investment into the next generation. And we would love you to be a part of
 it. I think it would be amazing for all the spirits out there, even if you don't come to Grace Center,
 I would encourage you to consider investing, sewing where you want to go. We as a church have spent
 years giving away money to other churches, to other ministries to bless them. And there's
 something wonderful about investing into the kingdom that isn't in your backyard. I just love that we've
 sewn trees all around the world and now we're expecting our own orchard in our own house.
 If you would like to give towards Project WOW, go online at greycenter.us/give. If you'd like to
 learn more about Project WOW, there's a link in the show notes to my gorgeous hot smoking wife
 introducing the whole topic, talking through plans, giving you an idea of what we're doing.
 But we'd love you to come and pray with us and give if you feel led and we're super excited about
 it. Yeah, we're so excited. So for show notes, go ahead and head over to islandanaj.com/127.
 If you are interested in any of the details of stuff that we were talking about, you can
 find all the links there.
 And otherwise, have a wonderful week.
