 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Hey guys, well as you listen to this,
 we are all enjoying summer
 and just basically family vacation.
 So we're down in Florida
 enjoying some much needed R&amp;R with our family
 and our friends, but before we went,
 Alan did an interview with some very special guests.
 Yeah, a few weeks ago, I got to interview two guys, Corey, Westerhold and Aaron Martin.
 Both of them are living in Silicon Valley in California.
 They both work for some very interesting companies like Twitter, Yahoo, Facebook and Apple, but
 I didn't interview them because they've worked for companies I like.
 I interviewed them because they make one of my very favorite apps for iPhone and iPad.
 This is a little departure from our normal podcast format, but I think you're going to
 love the conversation I had with them.
 covers the Bible, Apple products, design, excellence, fonts, topography. If you
 already used a wrap, I'm sure you've appreciated the care they put into
 building it and you probably gonna be interested in the details of the
 behind the scenes. If you haven't used a wrap, I bet you're gonna want to after
 this. So without further ado, here's an interview I recorded with Corey and Aaron
 the geniuses behind my favorite Bible app, New Bible.
 Now, the first thing I wanna ask you guys is,
 am I pronouncing the name of your app correctly?
  </li><li>It's Nue Bueble.
 (laughing)
 No, you're...
  </li><li>No, yeah, New Bible's correct.
  </li><li>Well, here's the thing, you know, Helvetica New
 is the way I pronounce it, but I heard some people call it
 Helvetica New A, and I was like, is it New A Bible?
 So I didn't know what the story was by the name.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think I've heard Helvetica Noia,
 which I believe is what the Germans will say.
  </li><li>All the insufferable designers that we know
 call it Helvetica Noia.
  </li><li>Yeah, so I like to not be insufferable.
 So I'm just gonna say new.
  </li><li>Yeah, all right.
  </li><li>Depends on the crowd that I'm talking about it with.
  </li><li>Exactly, you'll adjust your parlamps
 to the level of designeriness in your audience.
 So I just realized I didn't even introduce yourself.
 So please introduce yourself to our audience.
  </li><li>Cool, my name is Corey Westerhold.
 I am a co-creator of New Bible without Silicon Valley.
 We're in Palo Alto right now.
 I'm Aaron Martin, the other co-creator of New Bible.
 I also live out here in California.
 Well, we're just thrilled to have you on the show.
 Thanks for coming on and talk to us.
 Thanks for having us.
 I guess my first question that I'm itching to know is,
 how did you end up deciding to make a Bible app?
 Talk to me about the process of why you wanted to do this.
 I guess it started for me probably
 the narrative of kind of been like throwing out there
 has been, oh, it was like just a few years ago
 after we moved to California,
 but honestly it was much longer ago than that.
 I lived in New York City for several years before,
 my wife and I moved out of California.
 And I remember the big thing for me was the iPad,
 and I remember when the iPad came out,
 I think it was the ESV released their version.
 They had at the time, like I think made
 like the most beautiful Bible out for the phone
 and it had this really nice navigation
 where you hit like kind of the book.
 You know, the book list and it kind of like was this
 like dark, you know, scrim that lived over the top
 of the Bible and it was this beautiful, like large,
 thin type and when they moved that over to the iPad,
 I remember using that at the church I was going to
 at the time, it was this church called Trinity Grace
 down in Chelsea and like seeing an iPad and it just being such a great experience.
 And at that time, like remembering like, oh, you know, this is great,
 but there are a few things I would do differently, like as an app designer
 and had this like thought back then, this is probably a, yeah, 2010,
 um, that I, you know, I, it'd be fun to like do a project like this.
 And then that just kind of, you know, like sat there and then some of
 years later ended up moving, you know, out to California and, um,
 we when we moved out here, my wife and I were looking for churches. And at the time, like,
 you know, I remember sitting in one of the churches we were visiting and wondering myself,
 like, Oh man, it'd be great. Like, I didn't have a paper Bible and it'd be great to like use a
 Bible on my phone while we're at church. And because this is the church where I like didn't
 project like the verse, like a lot of like modern churches that like project the verses up onto
 the screen. It's like, a lot of I need to use a Bible. But like this church didn't. So I like,
 I downloaded a bunch of apps.
 I just remember all of them just kind of being subpar and even the ESV, like being very similar
 to the way, very similar to the app that I had used several years prior.
 So at that time I was just like, "Oh man, I need to do this now."
 And so kind of came home one day and just started scratching around and photoshop a
 little bit and seeing what came up and came up with some, I think, pretty good ideas.
 Aaron is a buddy of mine and we know each other actually from a decade ago, I guess,
 back in 2004. Yeah, we both worked at this magazine called Relevant. And at different times,
 he worked right before I did. And right after he left, I came and worked there. But
 yeah, I remember Aaron and I were hanging out one day and I just like, through the idea by him,
 you know, about designing a Bible app and showed him a couple of my kind of like early screens.
 and he was really into it. But at the time, I worked at Apple. I think you were at high
 tail at the time.
 Yeah, I left AOL. That was at high tail.
 And we just weren't in a position to be able to do anything about it. So just kind of like
 sat on the shelf, literally. And then a couple years later, so this was 2014.
 in 2013, maybe.
  </li><li>Checking about Yosemite trip.
  </li><li>Yosemite trip.
  </li><li>2014.
  </li><li>2014, yeah.
 Spring 2014, we were,
 we went on camping trip to Yosemite.
 And when you're camping in Yosemite,
 you just have like a lot of time to talk
 and be alone together.
 That sounded weird.
 But yeah, we were just like, you know, on this road trip,
 it's like a five hour road trip from where we live.
 And just like kind of like chatting about stuff
 and Aaron had brought up to me, he was like,
 "What's going on?"
 He asked me a question,
 "What's going on with the Bible app?"
 And I was like, "I don't know."
 I'd love to do it someday,
 but it just doesn't make sense.
 And he kind of pushed me on it.
 He's like, "Well, what have we just did it?
 "What if we just did it, got it built,
 "just figured out how we got it,
 "we could get it released."
 Because I couldn't, at Apple,
 I couldn't actually release apps.
 You can't be a designer there.
 and I think it can employ you there.
  </li><li>You can't be an employee and release stuff
 to the abstract.
  </li><li>Right, 'cause they'll own it as basically the principal.
 Anything you create, your employer owns.
 That's fairly standard.
  </li><li>Yeah, essentially.
  </li><li>Yeah, essentially.
  </li><li>Even if you do it off to the side.
 And so I was like, well, I can't do it,
 but yeah, Aaron was just like, well,
 we need, it needs to be done.
 Like I hate using the apps that I use.
 I wanna make something that I wanna use.
 And I agree with him.
 And so we just like said, all right, let's do it.
 And uh--
  </li><li>Which was a very easy decision to make
 amongst the zero distractions of being in the wilderness.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like we were free from all of the tech trappings
 of Silicon Valley and looking around and seeing all these.
  </li><li>And you're staring at it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>How to go home.
  </li><li>And you're just looking at all of the wonder
 of God's creation and it was easy to sort of just go,
 let's just do it.
  </li><li>And then the next day we got home.
 (laughing)
 What it really looked like to do something.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 We didn't think about the immense amount of work
 that it was gonna take.
  </li><li>Yeah, so that's kind of that, sorry,
 that was like a long walk for him sandwich,
 but that was essentially like how the idea came about.
  </li><li>It was easy to jump on to the idea,
 just I had, you know, at relevant,
 when I was working there,
 talked to a handful of like publishers,
 and the idea of creating a Bible
 is just like a designer dream.
 I just love it.
 And then the shift, when I moved out here,
 My mind shift was going into church and realizing
 that more people were pulling out their phones
 to look at verses than were physical Bibles.
 So that just cemented the idea and the drive
 that like we have to do this.
  </li><li>One of the things, and I'm gonna spread
 some major love for your app, and it's legitimate.
 Your app lives on my home screen.
 It's my Bible of choice.
  </li><li>Have you gotten the check that we sent you yet?
 (laughs)
 But one of the things that you guys have touched on already,
 and it's the situation I find myself in a law,
 in that your app is meticulously created.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>And what I notice from a lot of people
 is it seems like design is a feature
 that it feels like most people have to be educated to care about.
 Now, not in the circles that you live in, I'm sure,
 but for the average person, like my reaction,
 when I show people any app that I prefer to use over another app,
 but let's talk about Bible apps.
 People will be used to using some of the commonly downloaded
 free Bible apps, and yes, they serve their purpose
 in that you can open them up and you can pick a translation
 and you can find a chat and you can find a verse.
 So utilitarian-wise, it does what it says on the tin,
 but there was something beautiful about opening up
 your app instantly, and then the more you use it,
 You know, you probably read the same people as I do, but Sean Blanc has this, you know,
 wonderful book called Delight is in the Details.
 Mm hmm.
 And there's a delight to using your app because of all these little details.
 And talk to me about some of the, I mean, I'm pleased to hear that you guys
 created the app for you primarily.
 You were like, we're going to build this for us.
 And it sounds like there's enough like-minded people who also fell in love with the app.
 But talk to me about the challenges of caring about design,
 'cause excellence is the sum of a thousand tiny details.
 Did you ever get to the point where like,
 ah, let's not sweat those details?
 Or talk to me about that design process.
  </li><li>I think, you know, when it's 2 a.m.
 And you've been working on something,
 you tend to like wonder if that detail is worth it,
 but I think that's the core of,
 that's the core of like equality design processes.
 Design not in the details, the design is the details.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I don't think, I think we,
 since we were crafting it for ourselves as like the,
 I mean, it wasn't the sole purpose,
 but we definitely wanted to make something
 that we would both enjoy to enjoy using immensely.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And when you're making something for yourself,
 it's very easy to continue on that quest
 for that perfect thing, that perfect interaction.
 We also had, I mean, Corinne, I did a talk,
 a tiny little thing at a church a couple of weeks back
 about design and Christianity.
 And it's just disappointing to see design
 sort of not care about Christianity.
 So I think it was easy for us to care
 about the design decisions and the details
 because we have this immense love and care
 for the product that we're designing and creating for.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I think that's gotten lost in the church lately.
 Design's not just something that you can throw on
 at the end or is not valuable.
 Even though the message is where the power is,
 that doesn't mean we don't have to care
 and craft the best experience we possibly can.
  </li><li>Right.
 It's not to get like churchy with it,
 or to get churchy with it, I mean, it's the podcast.
 But I think it's very similar to faith.
 If you think about your faith,
 and the way you live it out,
 it's not just about the things that you see.
 A lot of people think faith is this outward expression.
 It's things that I do, or things that I say,
 or the way people perceive me,
 but it's so much deeper than that.
 I think design is similar.
 Design isn't just the way something ends up being expressed
 in whether it's a book, or it's an app on a screen,
 So like a website or if you know, it's a fit like getting like film stuff like that like you have to care about these things
 And you have to like we give to walk out your faith every day and it's it's
 Meticulous and you have to be have to consider it every day and all throughout your days and design is the same way like
 When you're thinking about a product like you have to consider every single little part of that product
 and I think in a lot of ways to like
 You know just we're both of us are very fortunate and lucky to get to the jobs that we do
 at the kinds of places that we do out here, you know, at Aaron at Yahoo and we at Facebook.
 And it is a tenant of the products that we work on every day.
 And I think that just pours over into the work, you know.
 And I think this could be a long conversation much longer than a podcast conversation.
 But I think for me, my decision to go from working in the Christian industry,
 I before I was at relevant, I worked at, I was on staff at a church for several years.
 Aaron, this was the same thing. And the decision to go outside of that and be and put ourselves
 into environments that design was held at a higher standard and valued more. I think that
 basically that just like rubs off on you. And I definitely think that's rubbed off on me.
 And so doing that every day and then going to work on a project that happened to be like very
 like faith-centric, something like the Bible, you know, the things that like I'm exposed to every
 day of my day job has I think in a lot of ways just like it wasn't me it was just like the
 result of all the things that I've seen and conversation that I've had like kind of like
 spilling over into the thing that we worked on. You covered a lot of ground there some of which
 I'd love to unpack maybe at a later date. The thing that really interests me is you mentioned
 a talk that you did a couple of weeks ago please tell me that was recorded and is available online
 because I would love to watch and I know a bunch of our listeners who have to watch that.
 And if it is, we'll link in the show notes.
 It was recorded and it was definitely a, it's something that we both care about.
 I think the concept and the idea, and it was more of a first rough draft.
 I think self-aware enough to know that like we had a great idea and I don't think we hit it
 over the fence.
 I want to pick up on what you were talking about a little bit there because it's important to
 to know you guys have full time jobs that don't involve making new Bible.
 Like, you know, you work at Facebook, you work at Yahoo.
 You guys leave busy life.
 So it's important that people realize this is a labor of love.
 You built this app on top of having highly demanding jobs in Silicon Valley.
 Where do you a find the time and be?
 How do you stay motivated?
 Cause I find people have tons of motivation to start projects, but finishing them.
 Boy, that's a different story.
 It's really easy to get a lot of stuff done if you don't want to sleep.
 Sleep is overrated.
 Sleep is incredibly overrated.
 Let's sleep.
 Yeah.
 That's where we got most of our stuff done was after work late into the night.
 It was basically like working two full-time jobs for the most.
 I really feel bad.
 So I had left Apple and ended up getting a job at Twitter while we were building new
 Bible. And a live share of the design work had been done, but we had just started, I think we
 started development late in 2014. I just started my job at Twitter in 2014. And like,
 I definitely regret that in some ways, because I don't like, just being honest, like,
 parents, like, give me a look. Like, I don't think I like performed as well, or was as good an
 an employee is like, I could or should have been at Twitter
 because I was so focused on this.
 So I think like, how do you find the time?
 I don't know if I did find the time.
 I think it could be the expense of my job.
 And granted, like I didn't get,
 I feel like I was able to like course correct
 and like do some really great work
 and not be a complete waste of an employee.
  </li><li>No, I don't think that time was tough.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's definitely tough.
 I mean, I got married and had a baby
 in the midst of all of it.
 I mean, it's the fun thing to say,
 like, oh, we just stayed up late at night
 and pulled like the TV show sitcom,
 like start up together by like sweating
 and like drinking Red Bull
 and like theres a Hades montage.
 But the reality was it was a lot of really hard work.
 Like there's no magic potion to it.
 There was nothing special that we did
 that anyone else probably couldn't do.
 It was just spreading ourself very, very thin.
  </li><li>And how did your wives respond to that?
  </li><li>I still have a wife.
  </li><li>I also still have a wife.
  </li><li>So they responded well enough
 or I bought enough flowers that I made up for it.
  </li><li>Oh my God.
  </li><li>My wife was incredibly supportive.
 And I know Jocelyn has been immensely supportive as well.
 She does, I'm gonna say she does as much
 for new Bible as I do.
 My wife is in PR.
 She's done PR for slight magazine,
 on slight.com for over a decade.
 And she's been like very valuable.
 Like, ask her.
  </li><li>She's been immensely like--
  </li><li>It's not different, like, hey babe,
 can you do the, like she believes,
 I mean, like, I don't know if you know
 this part of the back strip,
 but like we, like, Dubai was like completely bootstrapped.
 So we paid for it completely out of pocket.
 And like, our wives were supportive enough to let us like,
 we're our savings.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And like that's, I mean, you're married,
 I'm sure you know, like that's a hard thing to do
 and to come in terms of what I've done.
 But anyways, yeah, I mean, she has PR and like,
 she was able to like, we had this on launch day.
 It was amazing.
 We were able to get this piece on the front page
 of Fast Company about like what we were doing
 and which was like crazy.
 And it was like, I remember that morning,
 like us all waking up and me and Aaron were texting
 and I was like crying and she was like crying.
 I don't know if Aaron was crying.
 I don't wanna like put that on you.
  </li><li>I don't cry.
 But it was just like, wow, like regardless of like this, where this thing goes, because
 you don't know at the launch or something, we were able to get like fast company, the
 front page of fast company the entire day to like have something about like a couple
 of dudes making a Bible.
 Yeah, which I felt like a big step.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So that was like really, really cool.
 And like I couldn't have done that without her support.
 And I know, because I know, I mean, just being married, like they could have gone a completely
 a different direction. But yeah, I think I'm always been late
 nights as well working on new Bible. It was, it was great to
 have the support. And I don't think if grace, my wife wasn't
 totally on board, I don't think I would have been able to hang
 on. It would have fizzled out for sure.
 Let me ask you this, because I'm fascinated in the behind the
 scenes details of how does one get rights to use the Bible?
 Because probably a lot of people don't realize the Bible and
 all its different versions are copyrighted works of many, many people.
 So, Zondervin just send you a text file or, I mean, talk me through how literally you turn a,
 I'm imagining just a raw text file that they send you into what we see on our screens in New Bible.
 How do you do that?
 Did you have to format and lay everything out and strip out footnotes?
 Tell me those nerdy little details.
 I'll let Aaron talk this.
 I can talk more about the like securing the right side of things.
 Yeah.
 Just from a pure implementation standpoint, Aaron and dealt with most of that with our dev
 team.
 But so, let's see, try to figure out how to say this.
 There's no good digital Bible text file.
 is just whatever each of these companies has decided to put together.
 So some of them we got an ebook file, like a dot ebook that we had to HTML file.
 We got one of the translations was 60 plus HTML files.
 And I'm not saying that because I don't know how many books of the Bible there are, but
 because it was just random, some books were split into.
 And some XML files, we got one that was just a single text file with some weird sort of
 like XML type tags and languaging inside of it.
 The short answer is there is no single good way.
 And I would absolutely love to spearhead a real way of normalizing.
 Normalizing how you show what a chapter is, how you show what a versus, how you show
 what a footnote is.
 Which is funny, it really makes you empathize with all of the different developers out there,
 whether it be the Life Church guys or the logo guys.
 I feel like I've heard that there is an effort underway, this service is basically unifying
 formats.
 I would love for that to happen.
 The reality is right now there is no single way that we got any of these translations
 together.
 Even if we got two XML files that were both just, that's the file type, the formatting
 and how they label all of the parents and children inside of these files is completely
 different.
 So we ended up having to build a localized sort of parsing engine that resides inside
 of.
 Yeah.
 new Bible, there's a, we read each of these things, parse it out individually, build our
 own database and archive files, which is why our search and our navigation is so lightning
 quick. We've had some speed issues with some of the older devices. What we did was very,
 very smart. And that's all on the dev team.
 Aaron's patting himself on the back right now.
 Yeah, it's just going to show.
 Go Aaron.
 I had nothing to do with that. The developers who built it, like came up with a great
 solution.
 And what's crazy, like so we just more behind the scenes I guess.
 So both Aaron and I are designers.
 Aaron is like much more technically savvy and Dev savvy I guess.
 I'm not even saying it right.
 You can tell us.
 I can speak their language.
 You can speak the language.
 And I'm just like not like I know like some you know like I can do it when I can build
 a website but like when it comes to some of this stuff I'm just like completely out
 on the dark and the guys that we,
 so we actually hired a development shot called HIPAA Labs.
 They were based in Canada and Istanbul.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Where were they in Canada?
  </li><li>Toronto.
  </li><li>Toronto, so Toronto and Istanbul.
 I mean, they weren't believers.
 Like they had no idea about the Bible.
 And like the fact that they were able to like build this thing
 unaware of like what we were having,
 it was funny like on our dev calls with them,
 We were having to, in addition to like talk about like
 implementation details of that, like talk about like,
 well, this is how the Bible works.
  </li><li>Here's what a verse is.
 Here's what a, which is a references.
  </li><li>Pretty, like when I, I guess I've never thought about that,
 like when I think about it, like look back and like,
 I don't know how we got that done.
 Like that's pretty incredible.
  </li><li>It was fascinating to like see them sort of pull
 the solution together.
 But short answer, there's no easy way to do it.
 And after seeing that, I think the greatest amount of respect I gained out of all of this
 was for the development team at LifeChurch, who has gone through something like 300 or
 400 translations.
 Yeah, we're dealing with a handful of translations.
 And we are honestly, like we're only dealing with a handful.
 We get emails like I would say probably multiple times a day.
 Easy.
 asking for all of these additional translations and all these different languages.
 And I think it's hard to say, well, you don't understand how it works, but you don't understand
 how resource-intensive it is. Pull each of these individual translations in. So when I think about
 just this small team, it's me, Aaron, and we have this, our developer right now is this guy named Zach,
 who's based in Kentucky. The three of us being able to do that at any kind of scale, it just
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 It doesn't happen.
 That's the business side of negotiating.
 Yeah, the business side of translations is pretty rough.
 It's tough.
 Yeah.
 And in retrospect, it's been a learning process.
 But I think when it comes to, oh, it's not for a lack of want to do it.
 Yeah.
 It's not like we don't like the NLT.
 But it just-- so we just talk about the technical realities
 of implementing these things.
 but like the business realities
 of like acquiring some of these translations,
 it's hard.
 And I think if we did this full time,
 like if this was our full time gig,
 it would be much easier, you know?
 We were not easier, but it would be more tenable.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>But like the fact that like we're doing these things
 on the side and like, I, you know, like can get to an email
 once maybe every week on the stuff
 wherever, you know, a couple of times a week
 versus like doing that every day,
 It just don't, the time it takes to like kind of facilitate some of these relationships is just tough when you do it on the sides.
 Yeah.
 Before we leave the technical talk, I found a great new use for new Bible that I hadn't thought about before, but I load up on the iPad Pro.
 My wife has an iPad Pro user.
 And so I load up the passage, whatever passage I'm either studying or preparing a sermon on.
 And I mean, obviously it looks beautiful.
 We haven't even got to talk about your choice of typography and all of that, which is gorgeous.
 But so I capture a page with screenshot.
 And then I import that into PDF expert and then I mark up that passage with the pencil.
 And it's an absolutely joy to use.
 It was another way of using your app in a new way other than just reading that.
 I was like, Oh, I love this.
 And I had some people around me watching me do this.
 That's great.
 Oh, that's incredible.
 That's a game change, I'm like, yeah, it really is.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's funny when the iPad Pro case,
 so I am also, is your wife, you choose the 129,
 or the one set?
  </li><li>Yeah, she uses the 129.
  </li><li>Yeah, I have the 129, it's like my favorite
 computer I've ever owned, and when we started,
 so we started working on the iPad,
 I guess back in January of this year.
  </li><li>Like the technical side of it?
  </li><li>Or just the implementation.
 We started on the design side of it,
 late last year.
 And I remember sitting down with some of the initial comps
 and looking at margin, margining the text
 and looking at the margins on the iPad Pro
 and just being like, oh my god, this would be amazing
 just sit here and read and be able to,
 rather than just tap and long press
 and hold and drag to highlight,
 I just wanna highlight with my pencil
 and I wanna leave notes in the margins
 of the iPad Pro with my pencil.
 So yeah, I'm absolutely tracking with you.
 But yeah, when it comes to implementing that thing,
  </li><li>That's a rewrite.
  </li><li>I mean, we haven't even considered it.
  </li><li>Oh, yeah.
  </li><li>I don't know if it's a rewrite.
 I think it's like, how do you do it in a way
 that like makes sense for people?
 'Cause like that'd be awesome to do on the pro,
 but then how does that then carry over
 into the rest of your experience?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Do you use OCR to basically like read those notes
 and like save those as notes in some format?
 Like I haven't gotten into thinking through that flow
 because it's probably beyond what we're capable of
 at this point, but I absolutely track with you
 that that would be an awesome thing to do.
  </li><li>Yeah, that workflow of layout screenshot at Markup,
 it's a joy because the reason I stopped reading--
  </li><li>Oh, that's good. - Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>I hadn't even thought of that.
  </li><li>The reason I stopped using a paper Bible
 is my Bibles would get stolen or I'd lose them
 and with it I would lose all my margin notes
 and my highlighting and minder lighting.
 So now I'm having that digital workflow
 because essentially I'm left with PDFs
 that I can read anywhere of my highly customized versions.
  </li><li>Yeah, so that's cool to hear you say that.
 I definitely use it on my pro and have been like,
 man, that'd be nice.
 If only I knew somebody that could do that.
  </li><li>Let me leave the technical talk for a little bit
 and let me segue into, I'm fascinated to ask you
 about the spiritual climate in Silicon Valley.
 As somebody who has always had a keen interest
 in technology, somebody who has spent some time
 in Silicon Valley and I did my research paper
 in Mountain View back when I was doing my degree.
 And so I fell in love with Palo Alto.
 I remember eating at Yill Finayo
 and just loving that restaurant.
 But I've always had a keen interest
 but looking from the outside in,
 I don't know why but I'd never considered
 there was a huge Christian presence there
 because the whole world revolves around tech.
 Like if you come to Nashville, wherever you wander around,
 you know, where the buckle of the Bible belt,
 there's a Christian influence everywhere.
 I'm not saying that's great.
 When my time spent out in the valley,
 it wasn't a noticeable Christian influence.
 So what is the spiritual climate like there?
 Like do you feel isolated as believers
 working in a tech culture?
 Are you considered peculiar because of your beliefs?
 Or is there an openness for what you believe?
 Talk us about that.
 Give us an insights window on what life is Christians
 and Silicon Valley is like.
  </li><li>It's interesting.
 So I just for background,
 I actually grew up in Birmingham.
 So I grew up in the Bible Belt in the South and lived in that and existed in that until I was 23, I guess, before I left home.
 Or I left Alabama.
 And so it is definitely like different than the South, obviously.
 There is, I think there's a pretty good community of people here.
 Yeah.
 I think what's interesting is like,
 I would almost expect it you to be seeing this peculiar
 out here and I've definitely felt some,
 I mean, just being real, like, you're working at,
 like in these companies, like,
 there's a nervousness to like talk about that stuff.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But I remember just anecdotally, like,
 I remember, so the day that New Biola came out,
 when I was at Twitter, I remember that evening,
 like I was getting rid of work and I,
 parking was under the building,
 I'd gone up to our security office to get my parking
 validated and I got it validated and I'm walking out
 the hallway to the elevators and got stopped by this couple.
 And they're like, "Hey, you're Cory."
 I was like, and I had never met them before.
 And I was like, "Yeah, yeah, how's it going?"
 I didn't say I have no idea who you are.
 But I was like, "Hey, you know, yeah."
 They're like, "Oh man, like we saw about new Bible today,
 that is awesome. That's awesome to see somebody out here who's Christian like just like owning
 it. And it's like, it was this weird, it was this weird moment for me because it's like, I didn't,
 I don't think we did this. I can't speak for you, Aaron. I didn't do this to say like, Hey,
 everybody like, I'm a believer. Look at this thing that I made. I just like, I wanted something,
 Yeah, I wanted a Bible that like didn't sacrifice quality and didn't sacrifice like
 thoughtfulness and design and just made that thing. It wasn't about like being a Christian. It wasn't
 about like sharing my faith. It was just about like doing this thing. But like what happened after
 that was really interesting. So that happened one day. And then I remember like a couple days later,
 a couple of people like during messaging me on Twitter and being like, hey, you know,
 you know, like, I didn't know you were a Christian too.
 Like, we have this thing where we like get together.
 Like there's a few of us believers here
 and like we get together enough coffee once a week
 and we chat and so I started going to that a little bit.
 So that was cool.
 And I think it's just like the whole like,
 everybody out here like does their own thing.
 It was kind of weird.
 Like you would expect to be looked at as a peculiar person.
 But I think because everybody's just like, you do you,
 like it's kind of nice because I think in New York,
 So I lived in New York before that, sorry, I'm long-winded.
 You definitely felt that.
 I definitely felt weird about like talking about
 like the fact that I was a believer.
 And I don't just personally, I don't like walk around
 and say, "Hey, Corey, my name is Corey, I'm a Christian."
 That's not how I believe that you should share your faith.
 But out here, yeah, it's, I don't feel weird about it.
 I mean, there's not a ton, it's not like the Bible about, but--
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I grew up in, I was born and raised in Southern California.
 So I've been in California most of my life.
 So a solid 32, 31 years.
 I've been alive in California, the rest elsewhere.
 One thing I've noticed about California Christians,
 you know, is it's very purposeful.
  </li><li>Sees as we call ourselves.
  </li><li>I lived in Orlando for a bit and church being in the South
 was definitely much more of a cultural experience.
 Like there was that aspect of it.
 Out here, it was less cultural and more purposeful.
 Like you didn't go to church,
 you didn't go to church to, you know,
 hang out with your buddies
 and then go to Panera afterwards.
 There was less of that and there was more
 of like an obvious commitment.
 Maybe I'm projecting, I don't know,
 but that was always sort of my observation.
 And the external view of California
 and its interaction with Christianity,
 definitely I think is,
 it's ratcheted up a little bit
 as opposed to what it actually is.
 I've never told someone I'm a Christian here,
 and then have them push me into the street
 and kick dirt on me.
 I'd say the biggest reaction I've gotten from someone is,
 oh really?
 You're a Christian?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>It's always, the default is, okay,
 Why would you believe that?
  </li><li>Right. - But whatever.
 So that's sort of the life cycle
 of the interactions I get most of the time is,
 oh, I didn't know you're a Christian.
 Okay, that's weird.
 And then that's it.
 And then they move on and then you're back to,
 I don't know, talking about design or go to the movie.
  </li><li>So what was interesting for me,
 like when we had a California was,
 growing up in the South,
 you always hear of California as being
 like the devil's playground.
  </li><li>Yeah. - And it's like this,
 It's gonna fall off into the ocean, it's horrible,
 and it's dark, and San Francisco,
 blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
 I don't get into that.
 And then coming out here and just like realizing
 not only like, is there like a,
 like pretty healthy church communities
 out here, very healthy churches,
 but like just the fact that like Calvary has,
 is pretty good in general,
 is I just felt like people were like lying to me back home.
 You know, like why are you trying,
 are you secretly going there?
 And like doing these things.
 And yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, growing up in church out here,
 we definitely were sort of told that we were
 like the mission field.
 So even being out here in California,
 the church is sort of a point of view
 or their thought was that,
 man, we're in the trenches.
 We're out here in California.
 It's the devil's playground.
 And I'd never really got that.
 It's about as much as the playground of the devil is and the other city.
 Right.
 I mean, it's just it's full of regular people who need Jesus just like they do in Nashville,
 Nashville or Birmingham or, you know, Iowa.
 So a broken person is a broken person.
 Right.
 It doesn't matter how broken.
 Well, I have to say that when I when I saw your app initially, I was
 excited that somebody was tending to the Word of God with such deliberate care and intention.
 And when I opened it up and started to use it, I was like, oh, I am so thrilled to see a truly
 excellent app independent of whether it's the Bible or not. You know, if it was just a, you know,
 an e-reader, just the way that navigation happens, the way that all of the interface
 strips away until you need it. They're really thoughtful gestures. I just loved that this was an
 A-Class app in terms of usability, and then it was a Bible program. I just loved that somebody
 was... I think the difficulty that we have as Christians is we have an awful lot of people with
 more influence than us speaking on behalf of us indirectly. So it's horrendous when we see
 Christians on Twitter or Christians on the news or Christians who have a professing faith in Jesus,
 but then are saying things that are completely contrary to his nature or our values. And then
 we have to go into work and people are like, "Oh, you're one of those," which is probably why you're
 getting surprised. So to take that little dynamic and put it into the microcosm of the world, we used
 where we live in, which is apps, technology, to see somebody represent us well through your craft,
 which is building apps. It was an absolute joy because nothing would be worse than opening up a
 Bible app that's getting a lot of attention and it's set in papyrus or it's just a terrible
 implement. Do you know what I mean? So I think you guys have done a great job.
 Papyrus was on our short list of stuff to use.
 Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah. Just as somebody who lives on the other side of the country, who
 moves in a similar circle as you guys do in terms of the things we appreciate, I was so thrilled
 to see something done with such excellence that represent a thing so well.
 And it genuinely thrilled me that, oh my gosh, there's app developers who
 not only love Jesus, but are fanatical about producing brilliant apps.
 So well done on that.
 Quite apart from the fact I love using your app.
 Thank you.
 I was just encouraged before I even admit you that, you know, there's
 Christians out in Silicon Valley.
 And that sounds ridiculous and very short sight as if there's no Christians in
 California.
 I know that not to be true, but nevertheless, there's a point I'm trying to make
 in there somewhere and I'm not sure how well I'm articulating.
 That's incredibly encouraging.
 We, when we started designing new Bible, we kind of, maybe it sounds a bit too much to say we hit a
 wall, but we were kind of frustrated with a couple of things. And then Corey at one point
 just kind of flipped it. And it was like, we're designing a reading experience. So that's what we
 need to do. So how can we design an excellent reading experience?
 And I think that for us, it just opened things.
  </li><li>Like light bulbs went off.
  </li><li>Yeah, and yeah, I think in a lot of ways
 we started making it for us.
 And I think then we were hitting some of those walls
 and we had to realize,
 oh, it's just about being your experience for reading.
 And I think in a lot of ways, it's like,
 this needs to embody a lot of the just points of view
 we have about interaction design and app design period.
 What would it look like to make an app
 that we think contains all of the best UX thinking and gestures and all of the stuff
 that we would want to see in that period.
 It just so happened to coalesce in an app that we can make the Bible.
 So I'm really excited that you saw that and recognize that.
 That means a lot.
 It's something we talked about in our design in Christianity, Spiel, taking away the fact
 that it was the Bible also helped us to be objective about it and not just rely on the
 fact that it was the word of God and we could get away with not trying to craft the best
 possible experience.
 So taking that away and just trying to be objective about the design quality itself,
 I think helped us push further than we probably would have if we had just stuck with this
 idea of, hey, we're designing a great Bible.
 Well, I think you guys did a great job when you hit the nail on the hat.
 Thank you.
 If you guys have not checked out new Bible, I would really encourage you to do it.
 It's an app that screams of intentionality.
 There's an obvious care for details that just adds up to a brilliant reading experience
 and a great navigating experience.
 You're going to be the envy of everybody sitting to your left or right or behind you
 because people are going to be looking at what app are you using.
 It's available for iPhone and for all sizes of iPad.
 my Bible reading app of choice and I'd highly encourage you to check out.
 Where can people find out more information about you guys and about new Bible?
 How can we find you on Instagram, Twitter, websites?
 Give us all those details.
 Yeah, so if you want to read more about kind of new Bible and all of the details about it
 that you might not see just by using the app, just go to the website, newbible.co.
 I, both Erin and I are pretty active Twitter users, maybe too active.
 Maybe a bit.
 You can find us on Twitter. I'm I'm Corey. I am K O R Y and I am I am Aaron Martin. I am Aaron Martin.
 You can also find us at We Are Dorks. I think I stole that from you when I couldn't just get Corey.
 Yeah, then on Instagram, I'm that everywhere. I'm the same. I'm Aaron Martin on pretty much every social channel you can find.
 My my spaces. I'm Corey
 Friendster God bless my space. I will put links on the show notes for everybody who wanted to follow you guys and they can also can link there
 No problem, but I super appreciate not only your efforts on the app but taking time out this afternoon and talk to me
 Thanks so much for doing that. Yeah, yeah, I enjoyed it. All right. Well, thanks guys. Appreciate it
 Did you have fun recording that babe? Yeah, I loved picking the brains of people who make delightful things
 If you haven't yet checked out their app, please visit our show notes for this episode at allen and aj.com/110
 And we'll post a link to the app and everything else that we talked about in that interview
 Including the links to their social media so you can follow them for now. We're gonna go back to the beach
 We hope you guys are having an amazing week
 Join us next week for another different but brilliant interview while we're still on vacation
