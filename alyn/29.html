<p> Mrs. AJ Jones?<br/>
 Mr. Alan Jones?<br/>
 This is like a scene from Driving Miss Daisy.
 It's very similar. Only you should be in the back seat.
 Or I should be in the back seat and you should be in the front seat.
 Or something.<br/>
 Then in which case it's nothing like driving?
 It's absolutely not. It's more like days of thunder.
 For those of you who haven't guessed and can't tell from the road signs.
 Road signs?<br/>
 If you can see the road signs, you're good.
 You're very good.<br/>
 But those of you who can't tell from the road sounds.
 We're driving back from North Carolina on I-40.
 And I don't know why we waited to record a podcast,
 so we were on the really curvy twisty part.
 It's all curvy twisty.<br/>
 This is actually less curvy twisty than the last bit.
 I wonder if I should be holding a microwave for you.
 The microwave?<br/>
 No, dear God.<br/>
 Perhaps you should.<br/>
 I wasn't aware we were going to microwave things
 and record a podcast and drive.<br/>
 This should be such a long podcast.<br/>
 Maybe I should hold your microphone for you.
 Okay. Do you need to? Well, you're driving one-handed at the moment.
 You're driving no- you're driving no-handed when you smoke your cigarette.
 That's true. Well, when I have my cigarette, you can take the microphone.
 How was your week? It was a good week. We uhThat'
 s because it was a short week. It was a short week. We just- we drove out Wednesday, didn't we?
 No, we only worked Monday and Tuesday. Yep. And then took the rest of the week off for Thanksgiving.
 Went to see my sister and brother-in-law and their family in Charlotte, North Carolina.
 I don't know why it's a dub with an English accent.
 I don't know.<br/>
 But Monday and Tuesday we taught at the school.
 Well, we didn't really teach.<br/>
 We taught one session.<br/>
 We taught a bit, and that's it.<br/>
 And our wonderful Danielle Helson taught the rest of the weekend.
 She did an amazing job.<br/>
 And she organized all the outreach and the treasure hunts.
 And just-- but that's what she does.<br/>
 For those of you who don't know, Danielle,
 Danielle is currently the school administrator
 at the school of supernatural life.<br/>
 But when we first met her, she was a student on the school
 and was one of the shyest people you would ever meet.
</p><ul>
  <li>Well, we met her before she was a student.
  </li><li>I see, I don't even remember meeting her.
  </li><li>Oh, I remember her 'cause she would sort of sit
 near the back at M&amp;A and I remember her
 on both encounters 'cause when she came on the re-encounter
 and there was only 20 people on the re-encounter,
 I remember thinking, wow, this is huge.
 Her and Carrie both came on it.
 And I thought for such shy people, it's amazing.
 Well, what was even more amazing than that was when she was a student on the school.
 We taught a week on supernatural evangelism, how to spread the good news of the Kingdom
 of Jesus through signs and wonders, through healing people and through giving people prophetic
 words and releasing the presence of God.
 And so, not only did we teach it, we made all the students go out.
 And God bless her, she took this huge risk.
 And what do you know, she ends up being now this absolute pioneer for supernatural evangelism.
 So it was a great thrill to watch her teach and she did such an awesome job.
 Oh yeah and she's a brilliant teacher but it's so fun to watch somebody who's so passionate
 about it.
 Share it because that's when people catch it.
 Right.
 If you have, I think we've mentioned this before but if we haven't it's our bad.
 But if you go to her website cultivateboldness.com there you will see videos and read testimonies
 of her going out and actually just doing the stuff and she leads many teams.
 done New York, she's done Atlanta, she's done all over Nashville. She also leads
 our Friday night street evangelism ministry at Grace Center called Friday Night
 Lights but she's amazing but that was a lot of fun to teach that and then like I
 said we jumped in the car on Wednesday and drove eight hours. Yeah with
 breaks it ends up being closer than nine but the kids did great. It's amazing what
 Ben had rolled this. Just kidding. We didn't drag them. I felt like
 I'm like dragging them at one point, but no just kidding.
  </li><li>They just sat in iPads, bless them.
 How was your Thanksgiving?
  </li><li>It was really good.
 It was very peaceful.
  </li><li>I don't remember being peaceful.
 I remember being in a house full of children.
  </li><li>Yeah, but the four older ones all get along great
 and just pretty much played together.
 And it was mostly just muggies that wanted attention.
 Mr. Muggins. - And even then, he was
 content just to one to run the house.
  </li><li>Yes, and he played with Sam a lot,
 and Sam had lots of dinosaurs and trucks.
 And so, really, you know, we were only needed when cuddles were needed.
 And then we jumped in the car this morning and now we're driving back.
 Now being a Sunday.
 Really early we jumped in the car.
 Yeah.
 We've never left this early before.
 We took the day off to drive home.
 And it's been okay.
 It's been great, actually.
 There's been very little traffic.
 And leaving that early, you sort of beat everybody out of the city.
 So it's been great.
 What do we have coming up this week?
 I'm teaching at the school.
 You're teaching at M&amp;A.
 That's right.
 We have like, "Staph Christmas" party, that kind of stuff.
 Yeah we do.
 What are you teaching out at the school?
 Um, intimacy in the song of Solomon.
 I can't wait for the Bratical.
 Haha, but hoh, baby.
 Hahahaha.
 Hahahaha.
 Yup.
 I think I'm blushing.
 I think you are too.
 Hahahaha.
 You know I wanted to talk about this week.
 What did you want to talk about?
 I wanted to talk about celebration.
 Celebrate good times, come on.
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
  </li><li>We don't have copyright released to use that.
  </li><li>How many bars do I have to sign before we need that?
  </li><li>Okay.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I'm pretty sure it's like 12 bars.
 I didn't think that much.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>By the way, that was enough.
 I was thinking this year has been a big year
 for celebration, my 40th year for--
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And it's the birthday.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>With Michael John's birthday.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>With graduation.
  </li><li>Well, we didn't really celebrate Michael John's birthday
 'cause you kept being sick.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But he'll never know, he's only two.
  </li><li>Right.
 But then we all said thanks,
 giving you a Christmas coming up.
 And something has changed this year.
  </li><li>That's true.
  </li><li>We mentioned this on the podcast
 we talked about your birthday,
 but you seem more buoyant and excited about celebration.
 And we were just talking about it
 before we pushed record.
 It seems like America has healed your heart
 in celebration.
 Care to comment on that?
  </li><li>Yeah, I would say it's been
 like a slow progress in the right direction. But for me, I would head into
 more of a dark place coming up to my birthday and just try and survive the holidays.
 And once we get to like January 2nd, I'd be like, "Oh good, we can get back to life and nobody has to pretend that they're happy."
 Okay, so I never got the memo. I don't know. I supposed to pretend to be happy. I was quite happy.
 Why was the holidays so traumatic for you?
 I always try to buy you good presents. It has nothing to do with that. You're very good at buying good presents
 It has everything to do with losing dad and so even that even though it's over 20 years ago, right?
 I think when you lose someone
 Well for me anyway
 Every holiday after that became about him not being there and
 and how much better it would have been if he was there and
 what I'd be doing if he was there and all that kind of stuff.
 So...
 How did moving to America help heal that then?
 I think because you can't live here without picking up on...
 they celebrate everything.
 They being Americans.
 Americans. I mean they're great at celebrating things.
 And to begin with, I would say that I spent the first year probably being annoyed.
 Just like mildly annoyed, but being like seriously folks, do we need to celebrate every
 president seriously?
 You know, and why do we have this day off and then that day off that you just...
 Welcome to this edition of Walking in the Light.
 Well, it's so... because I wasn't good at celebrating, celebration seemed like an inconvenience to
 me.
 Right.
 To have to act like I was having a good time doing something.
 And then they would find reasons to celebrate everything.
  </li><li>Right, and then-- - Like, congratulations.
 You graduated from kindergarten.
  </li><li>Right. - It's not so much a graduation
 as much as you finished.
  </li><li>And they'll do like little pictures and stuff,
 and I'm like, really?
 I mean, really?
 Babe, they do preschool graduations.
  </li><li>I know.
 They all look adorable in their little robes,
 in their little flat board hats, for tassels.
 I loved it.
  </li><li>So it's a diploma from preschool.
  </li><li>I was a bit sort of taken aback,
 and really, it probably wasn't until we'd been here
 maybe two years that the Lord started
 kind of working in my heart about I completely forgotten how to celebrate. I had basically
 shut down the chip in me that knew how to celebrate because it was too painful a thought.
 And my dad was really good at celebrating things and he would get quite excited and
 it was probably the only good memories that I had of him from being a child is, you know,
 Christmas. So, yeah, the Lord started challenging me to allow my heart to get excited, allow
 my heart to enjoy the bits that I can enjoy. And I would say it was slow progress.
 You know the other thing that I noticed that really helps is we are very, very fortunate
 to live in a culture, a church culture, and therefore our working culture lets a culture
 of honor.
 So we do a pretty good job of genuinely celebrating one another.
 And that's been a really big part I think for both of us.
 I don't think I ever really struggled with celebrating.
 I think I probably had trouble celebrating myself or being celebrated.
 So just being in a culture where people love very well and people are super honoring and
 people are very intentional about telling you how much they love you and what they appreciate
 about you does wonders to bring your heart out of incubation and into celebration.
 Yeah.
 I think that's awesome.
 And I remember you spoke on this, didn't you speak at church last year before about
 how to survive the holidays?
 Which I was like, it's kind of a negative topic babe.
 But it turned out you're not the only person who's had trouble celebrating and not the
 only person who finds holidays difficult.
 Yeah, I mean I would say I dreaded holidays so...
 Dread is a strong word.
 Is that why you're always so mean and angry?
 And I just stay in a cupboard.
 Get back in your cupboard.
 Don't come out till January 2nd.
 Who is horrible?
 You turn the holes on me and everything.
 Oh you poor honey.
 You know, it's one of my favorite verses and possibly one of the most obscure one of the most obscure verses in scripture
 Zephaniah 3 17
 This this verse shifted for me about how God celebrates me
 And us says this the Lord your God is in your midst
 The mighty one will save he will rejoice over you with gladness and he will quiet you with his love
 He will rejoice over you with singing and I remember hearing that verse in Toronto and just thinking that's an amazing verse
 How did I miss that?
 There's notion that God
 You know because I think you go from a fact that I'm a sinner saved by grace. I'm wretched
 I'm worthless. I'm a worm and if it wasn't for the grace of Jesus and the blood of Jesus
 I couldn't stand in his sight because he's holy and I'm wretched
 You go from that to okay. I'm a I'm a saint. Okay, that's good
 and then you move into this revelation of the Father's love.
 And then you move into understanding that God doesn't just love you,
 but He absolutely celebrates you and rejoices over you and delights in you.
 And that does something for your heart, and that does something for your...
 the way you look at life.
 Yeah, I totally agree.
 But I think also you have to start to value celebrating and then free yourself to be able to celebrate.
 Even the painful moments might be part of it. Does that make sense?
 make sense. I still, you know, I still at my birthday or Christmas, I still think
 about dad, I might, you know, cry for a few minutes or whatever. I mean, granted for
 me, it's been 20 years, but, and that needs to be okay too, but because instead of
 staying in that place, then I climb back out of it because there's so much to be
 thankful for and there's so much to celebrate. So I've almost released my
 heart from being hostage to sadness. If that makes sense.
 It does make sense.
 Yeah.
 Do you have any top tips for people who are dreading the holidays, Christmas, or have
 just come back from Thanksgiving and are thinking, "I'm never going to go stay with my family
 again."
 That was a nightmare.
 I guess for probably different tips for different stages or whatever, but I guess for people
 that have lost a family member this year, I would just say just be kind to yourself,
 give yourself lots of grace.
 the happy moments, you know, the stuff that you can enjoy do that, the stuff that you
 just need to cry through, cry through and have grace for yourself in the midst of that.
 For people that are just like, "Gosh, this is not that somebody's died or anything,
 it's just that family's hard."
 I would say, "Probably get our boundaries teaching."
 nobody else is actually responsible for how you feel or helping you navigate
 your emotions you know so for me with my family and stuff boundaries helped a
 lot because I realized wow you don't actually get to control how I feel I
 can go in positive and come out positive and I can choose not to be part of
 conversations I don't want to be a part of because you know I can set down some
 healthy boundaries. So... Can I share something I saw on Instagram now? Yeah.
 Our friend Krista had posted something by the author of the Shaq
 William Young or WP Young I think is known in the author world and he said
 this no one can tell you about you unless you think they can. Wow that's good.
 That's amazing. No one can tell you about you unless you think they can. That
 idea of actually people can say what they want about you you can't control it but you
 can control whether you're going to choose to receive it or listen to it. I thought
 gosh that's brilliant I wish I'd thought of that. So I think that's the challenge with
 any kind of family holiday like that we have conversations with people that we pastor that
 are you know just saying well you know when I get home it's like I'm not an adult anymore
 and this is how I get talked to and whatever.
 So we end up spending time saying, well, you can actually really nicely say actually, I
 can still honor my parents without being talked down to or being, you know what I mean?
 No, I think that's true.
 I think that you, because you can't control, because you can't change somebody else's
 behavior, you can change yourself so their behavior no longer works on you.
 So I always find, especially if you're around really dysfunctional family members and you
 know perhaps they're abusive verbally, perhaps they are treating you like a 13 year old but
 you're a 33 year old, you can actually realize, okay that's their issue, that's not my issue
 and you can de-escalate the situation by not responding.
 Yeah, not feeding into it.
 Yeah, we're letting it land, you know, that whole, like a water off of a deck.
 But I think also, like, I mean, I had moments with my family just, you know, where after
 learning more about the boundary stuff and you sort of being able to point out where
 things weren't really actually a healthy scenario going on, you know, where I wasn't realizing,
 "Oh, I'm actually being manipulated," or, you know, being able to go, "Actually, that's
 really manipulative so you can either say that a different way or we can talk about something else
 you know and and actually that helped a lot with how things went down at least for on my end
 I didn't leave feeling like I just went through the cheese grater. What about the whole issue of
 forgiving people like you can I think when we get in touch with any deficit we've experienced
 there's a tendency in our heart to hold other people hostage for the deficiency that we experienced.
 Yeah. And I think a much better solution to that is just realize actually
 people generally speaking to the best they can with what they have. Yeah, of course. And so
 releasing people from your, from what you would have liked. Yeah. And what you, or what you think
 it should have looked like or what you think it should look like. Yeah. All of those things
 would probably be real helpful. I used to stop just outside of arriving to my mom's house and
 praying tongues for a while in the car or soak, you know, just so that I could get my attitude
 and expectations in check because I knew that if my expectations were better, my experience
 was better. So I wasn't joining in with the unhealthiness. I was combating it by being
 full. Life is better, lived full. Life is definitely better, lived full. And we can
 say that with all authority because we're just eight at the cheesecake factory. Not like
 You know babe, I think we should do more podcasts on the road. I don't well
 I'm worried the sign quality is gonna be terrible
 It could be that the sound quality is gonna be terrible, but I can't make observations like this
 You know just from sitting in our living room for example
 We just passed an animal that I'm not actually sure
 What it was before it died because I couldn't tell but it was very large
 And all our listeners are all the more edified for that apparently I don't know animal bumps well enough to be able to tell them apart
 or tails. Oh my gosh. I'm not a hunter. I know it wasn't a raccoon though. Sorry.
 I also wonder what all these cars are thinking when we drive by them and
 we're both holding microphones. We should venture hands up and down like we're
 hip-hop artists. Now this this van is pulling up even with us to see what we're
 doing. Yeah they are. I'm gonna put my hat backwards. Should I
 I'll have even to them again. We have to take my shirt off. Do you have any bling put on your bling?
 I don't have any bling. Okay, we're bling less
 completely
 Definitely with that wing
 Hey little blessing quilt shop. Oh
 Let's not go there. No, I want big blessings if I can only get a little blessing by just totally Instagram this
 I just drove fastest by owning a big photograph. I think we quilt
 Well, so look for us in Instagram folks.
  </li><li>Yeah, hopefully for Instagram and not for
  </li><li>Like the police.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>All right, why don't you pray for everybody
 who's anxious about, or has difficulty celebrating
 or is anxious about going home for Christmas
 or has just been home for Thanksgiving
 and is making all sorts of horrible inner vibes
 in their heart.
  </li><li>That sounds like a very good idea.
 Now, would you prefer to keep my eyes open
 while I'm praying?
  </li><li>I'm indifferent.
  </li><li>Really?
 Do you want to steer?
  </li><li>I'm fine.
  </li><li>All right.
  </li><li>Jesus, take the wheel.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>You missed an opportunity to sing right there.
 Anyway, ah, Father, Father, I thank you that you are
 really, really, really, really good
 and you're really big, you're bigger than our circumstances.
 So Lord, I pray for all those people that just
 have a difficult time when they're around family,
 that they find that they revert to someone they don't want to be
 or they end up in situations that they don't want to be in because, you know,
 families tough and there aren't healthy boundaries in place.
 God, I ask that you would give each of those people wisdom on what some good,
 healthy boundaries would be.
 You know, what,
 what some good guidelines would be for a spending time with family and just being
 able to enjoy it instead of entering into it with, with thread.
 And Lord, I ask that for those that could really relate to,
 I've lost and now I don't know how to celebrate.
 It feels just absolutely overwhelming.
 Lord, I ask that you would come
 and you would really wrap your arms around
 every person who suffered loss,
 especially in the last couple of years
 where it just feels so raw.
 Lord, I ask that you are comfort and your love
 and your grace and your mercy would absolutely overwhelm them
 and cover them in this holiday season,
 that they would feel your presence around them
 and they'd feel your strength underneath them carrying them,
 and that they would have those moments of joy
 that just bring love and bring life.
 Father, I thank you that you're good
 and you're faithful, you're always faithful.
 Lord, I ask that for every single listener God,
 that your faithfulness during this season
 would shine through and God that you would help us
 to trust you enough to celebrate,
 or that you would help our hearts go to a place
 where we can trust you, that you are good,
 that you have a great plan and that we can celebrate with you.
 But I thank you that in every place that we are,
 you're there in the midst with us.
 In Jesus' name.
  </li><li>All right, your homework for this week listeners
 is find someone that you genuinely wanna celebrate
 and do an awesome job of celebrating them this week.
  </li><li>That's great homework.
  </li><li>Perfect.
 Alright, we love you.
 Bye!
 That was a little abrupt.
 Say.
 Bye bye.
