<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end an AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Welcome to episode 261 of Keeping Up With The Joneses.
 This week, I have one of my besties in the whole world
 sitting here with me, Sarah Jackson.
 Welcome.
  </li><li>Why, thank you.
 Hi, everybody.
 Normally we do the weekly catch up at the very beginning,
 And so Sarah's actually going to join me for the weekly catch up.
 So normally the guests aren't part of this.
 So I hope you feel very, very privileged.
 Yes.
 It was a big week in the Jones household.
 Um, Sarah came into town.
 I didn't sleep for like two nights beforehand.
 It felt a little bit like Christmas.
 It was very exciting.
 Yes.
 We were counting down the days and getting ready.
 And why is it a big week?
 Eight a.k.
 Well, I am turning 50 this week coming.
 And on the previous Saturday,
 some wonderful friends threw me a 50th birthday party.
 So Sarah flew in early for that.
 And my friends pulled off this amazing event.
 I bald.
 It looked multiple times.
 Multiple times.
 It looked beautiful.
 I kept looking around at the party
 and looking at the people that were there
 and thinking, "I love every single person that's here,
 and I feel so honored to know them."
 And then I would cry again.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>It's true. - It's fine.
 It's fine.
 And so had a wonderful party,
 and then the next day, which was Sunday,
 church was great, and then celebrated MJ's ninth birthday,
 which is actually today, but we celebrated yesterday.
  </li><li>And there were balloons and there was cake,
 and there was little boys running around and screaming
 and having the best time.
  </li><li>Yes, let's talk about the cake for a minute.
 Actually, I think I've washed my hands enough today
 that most of the dye, well, there's a little bit
 of still blue, but we got an ice cream cake
 and they made it look like a blue monster,
 which was really great and had the wow factor.
 And MJ was like, "That's amazing, look at this cake."
 until you try and cut it and touch it.
 And then the blue just didn't come off of my skin.
  </li><li>It didn't come off of anybody's skin, I think.
  </li><li>Yes, and the kids decided to take the blue paint
 and like almost blue man group it, you know,
 like squish it on their faces.
 And this morning, Tia went to school
 with a tinged blue face as did MJ.
  </li><li>Yes, I mean, I think the parents looked away
 for 10 seconds and we turned back and it was...
  </li><li>It was, yes.
  </li><li>It was probably an awesome birthday party for them.
  </li><li>You know, they had a great time, yes.
 And they didn't mind their blue tinge.
  </li><li>I mean, I have questions about what's in the frosting
 when it doesn't come off your skin
 after multiple scrubbing.
  </li><li>And yet they ingested it.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So crushed up permanent markets?
  </li><li>I don't know, I feel pretty great about it though.
 And unfortunately the cake was put in the trash.
 So we can't even--
  </li><li>Oh, no, how did that happen?
  </li><li>We can, yes, no, we did it on purpose.
 We threw it out, it had to go.
 So we've had a great week
 and we're gonna have another wonderful week this week.
 But today, we are talking about dream interpretation.
  </li><li>Yes, so because we're on our five things theme
 that we're doing, we've asked Sarah,
 what are five things that you didn't know
 about dream interpretation before you sort of got into it?
 I don't know if those are like five rules
 or five things, you did whatever,
 however you wanna, this is yours to speak to me.
 Tell me, oh, why's one, you're five things.
  </li><li>Oh my, well, number one,
 really this was the first thing that I learned,
 which I thought was quite a significant one,
 was that God speaks through dreams today.
 And that was really the foundation of my starting journey with dreams, because no one had grown
 up in church, but no one had ever really mentioned that God was speaking through our dreams today
 and that we could expect to hear him, that the outflow of the Holy Spirit, like I talked about in
 Joel and Acts is that pouring out the Spirit would be that we would be dreaming dreams, would be
 sing prophetic visions, you know, we'd be speaking out prophecy. And when I saw that
 scripturally, I'm like, I want in, I want to be hearing God's voice.
 You know, it says in Psalms that he counsels us in the night.
 And, you know, I love that, you know, because, you know, counseling can be expensive.
 So I'm really, you know, I really fall for the additional wisdom.
 So recognizing that God is wanting to speak healing dreams, warning dreams, creative dreams.
 I mean, when you think about it, insulin for diabetics was discovered through a dream,
 the Canadian.
 I didn't know that.
 Yes, Frederick Banting had a dream and through that dream created insulin as a medicine for
 people with diabetes.
 Think about the Titanic.
 There were 19 documented warning dreams that the Titanic was going to sink.
 you like to have been one of those people who got a warning dream and listened to it and said,
 "Oh, I'm going to have a council my ticket." Right.
 And so my number one really is God speaks to us in dreams today in all sorts of ways.
 Healing dreams, solution dreams to your problems. And you know, the Bible says that we have not
 because we ask not. Yeah. So many of us are like, "Well, I don't have any dreams. I'm not. Well,
 Well, have you asked for them?
 Have you been asking God to come and help you
 bring solutions to your job problems,
 to your relationship problems,
 to give you healing in the areas that you have pain?
 And I mean, I don't know if you do this on your podcast,
 but can we pray right now?
  </li><li>Of course.
  </li><li>'Cause I'm-- - We do pray
 on this podcast.
  </li><li>I had a feeling if you did,
 but I just haven't done your five things podcast yet.
 So if you're listening and you're like,
 "Oh yes, I want dreams.
 Why don't you just pray with me right now, really simply,
 Father, thank you that you speak through dreams.
 I want to hear you.
 I want to hear your voice.
 Would you give me God dreams?
 Creative solution dreams, invention dreams,
 warning dreams, message dreams.
 Please speak to me in the night.
 Amen.
  </li><li>Amen.
 I was thinking, you already know I'm a dreamer,
 but you were talking about like to solve problems.
 I remember when we got hugely into Zelda,
 which this is just kind of like funny,
 but sweet of God, I would sometimes get stuck on a puzzle
 and I'd go to sleep and I would dream the solution
 to the puzzle and I would wake up and I'd try that
 and I could do it.
 And I was like, oh, God, do you care like even
 about the little tiny things enough
 to actually give me a dream about solving it,
 which I thought was very sweet.
  </li><li>I think it's awesome.
 I think it's the kindness of God
 and it reveals his relationship with you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>He cares about things we care about.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Number two.
  </li><li>Number two, get ready.
 Timing is really important.
 (gasps)
 Dreams come in the context of our lives.
 You know, Daniel said to Nebuchadnezzar
 that God wants to speak to you
 about the thoughts you've been having in your mind.
 So 95% of the time our dreams will be contextualized
 by our life.
 They will be speaking to us about the experiences
 that we're having, we're about to have.
 They will be revealing the thoughts of a heart.
 They will be maybe bringing a solution to a problem
 that we didn't know that we had.
 And that's really exciting to me
 because it's speaking of God's a really present God,
 present in the moment, present in the midst of our life.
 He's Emmanuel God with us, not like,
 oh, Emmanuel far away, but he's with us.
  </li><li>Yes.
 I think that's super encouraging.
 I think if I'm honest, I think sometimes I've had dreams
 where I'm like, well, because I was pondering that,
 or I'm in the midst of this,
 I kind of write off the dream as like pizza dreams.
 You know what I mean?
 Like, oh yeah, I mean,
 'cause I was thinking about that this week or today
 or whatever.
 And so I discount that God might be actually speaking
 to me about it because of being unaware
 of the dynamic that you're talking about.
  </li><li>Yes, so look for the timing.
 Don't be surprised when God speaks to you
 about something that's happening in your life
 or about to happen.
 I don't know about you, AJ, but I know Ben and I
 have had so many dreams when job opportunities
 have appeared and either have a dream a few days beforehand.
 And it seems like God's really speaking about something,
 a positive new opportunity.
 So we're like, oh, I don't see what this is.
 We're praying and then boom, Ben's boss sits him down
 and says, oh, I have this new role for you.
 And we're like, that's what God was speaking about.
 And it gives us all these details that encourage us
 and give us kind of this big yes in our spirit
 to be able to move ahead with it.
  </li><li>Yeah, well, I mean, you know, we ended up here
 because of a couple of visitations and a couple of dreams.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And even with what we shared on the podcast last week
 about adoption and everything,
 that's all been very much dream led,
 and I've lost count where I'm at 12 or 13 at this point,
 and you know, Allen's at three or four.
 So like, yeah, I mean, that makes a lot of sense to me.
 'Cause it also, I think, I don't wanna like steal any of your,
 I don't know what your things are.
 But I think it gives my heart comfort in the things
 where it's, you know, you're dreaming about it ahead of time
 and you're sort of like, this is all new information,
 but then when that door starts to open,
 whether it's a promotion or whatever to go,
 "Oh God, you took the time to prepare my heart ahead of time."
 So it's not the shock that it would have been
 or I'm ready to give a yes where I might not have been
 if we're paying attention to our dreams.
 Yes, and you know, with all the dreams that you've had,
 I've been, you know, excitingly being able to be
 in that journey with you.
 And just when you'd be like,
 I've had another dream, I could just feel the sizzle
 of the Holy Spirit, like, wow, God's excited.
 He's sort of like, I can't wait, I wanna,
 it stir the anticipation in your heart.
  </li><li>Yeah, so good, love that.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's a good one.
 Okay, oh, number three, dreams break through
 the paradigm of your thinking.
 Now, we all know that we have lots of filters
 and our belief systems and what we think are pretty static.
 And you may not realize that you walk around
 with boxes on your head, but you do.
 Basically things that you're thinking receives or rejects.
 And so dreams break through the paradigm of our thinking
 and land in our heart and enable us to receive them
 in a way that maybe you've had 10 people in your life sit you down and be like, "Hey,
 you know, I just wondered about this in your life." And you've been like, "No, no, no,
 no." And then one day a dream from God confronts you, perhaps with a truth, perhaps with a blind
 spot in your life that you've been pretty resistant to.
 When I think about Pharaoh in the Bible, I think about the Magi. You think about the
 Magi, they've met with Herod, they've found Jesus, and then the Lord warns them in a dream
 to not go back the way they came, but to take a different route to avoid visiting Herod. And I
 think often we're like, "Well, he wasn't too bad. He received us so well." And we might be on a path
 just assuming things are well, and yet God will interrupt us through breaking through those paradigms.
 Right. If we're paying attention.
 If we're paying attention.
 Okay. So when I was first learning to interpret dreams,
 I was also in a big heart process really getting in touch with my feelings and realizing I had
 quite a lot more feelings than I had initially imagined. And I, you know, maybe my background,
 I had made a lot of decisions and I knew I wasn't an angry person. I mean, I didn't get angry.
 I was just the person with the longest fuse you'd ever met.
 And I started having quite a troubling series of dreams
 where in the dream I would be filled with rage and anger
 and often the dream would end with me like screaming with anger at somebody.
 And you know, those are first few dreams.
 You're going to laugh, A.J.
 But the first few dreams I would look at the other person in the dream and think, well, clearly I'm not an angry person.
 So this must be about them?
 It must be about them.
 But you know, probably on the sixth or seventh dream, I began to have a revelation.
 I may be in a slow learner at that point.
 I am too, so I'm with you.
 Okay.
 I say, wait, I want to...
 Could this dream be a bit about me?
 I'm the main person in the dream.
 I'm feeling a lot of intense emotion,
 and this is a bit of a freebie, big feelings in dreams,
 point to, okay, this bit you need to look at.
 Yes.
 So I was like, I won, I mean, it's very odd.
 And so as soon as I began to bring that to God,
 it opened up a floodgate of revelation for me
 that I had been so resistant to before that I would have been so intense about knowing
 that I wasn't an angry person until the Lord revealed it to me and that there was a lot
 of buried anger that he wanted to process with me.
 That's so cool. That's so cool. I love that. And like as you're saying, I haven't had that
 about being angry, but I certainly had that about going into ministry.
 And I've told the story on the podcast before, but I had five major prophets pick me out,
 say about traveling the world and speaking in stadiums and, you know, speaking to groups
 of people and God using my life to restore others.
 And I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
 Like all the way through just like having none of it.
 I think you've all missed it.
 And then I had a dream.
 And it was a dream that shifted my heart to be able to hear what the Lord was saying.
 I can't control my dreams.
 No.
 You know, and so I, and also I woke up with a residue of hope where I was resistant to hearing
 it from man.
 I wasn't resistant to hearing from God.
 So powerful.
 So that makes a lot of sense to me that one.
 I'm like, yep.
 Yep.
 It's been my experience.
 Number four.
 Four I think we're on four.
 Yes.
 Let's call it four.
 Let's talk about nightmares.
 Okay.
 And lots of everybody I've ever met really has had a nightmare, a bad dreamer, you know,
 a night trauma, whatever you want to name.
 Nite terrors.
 Night terrors.
 That was the one I was going for.
 But I used to have.
 Yeah, I agree.
 And nightmares are often the cry of the unhealed heart.
 Well, that would make a lot of sense.
 So really...
 Thank you.
 I got to go.
 heart is in pain and it's kind of waving a hand, maybe two hands, maybe shrieking loudly, saying
 I am in pain. I am afraid there are big things out of control in my life. I've experienced trauma,
 terror, wounding. I need you to take notice. And you know, sometimes as Christians, we can attempt
 to put all night terrors in the box of, oh, that is just, that's just a demonic, it's
 a demonic thing. And, you know, for sure that there can be a demonic night incidents, but
 the vast majority of nightmares and night terrors are actually our hearts in pain,
 trying to communicate with us saying, Hey, I need your help processing these feelings.
 I need your help working through that trauma that happened to me.
 Right.
 And, you know, I have talked to so many people over the years who often are like, "Oh yes,
 I used to have this recurring nightmare that would happen time after time."
 And as we start to look at it with the Holy Spirit, he just unlocks this beautiful healing
 moment because you know we may be 30 years 40 years 50 years removed from that night
 terror and yet there there's still a moment of healing that God wants to do.
 I as a child I had a recurring nightmare that came after I read a book that was probably
 a bit too old for my age.
 An Enid Blighton famous five book which seems so innocuous but there was you know a man
 in a black mask, it was, I think, thieving things, but I started having dreams where I
 would be in a field and a man in a black mask would come and I knew I couldn't get away.
 And I would wake up crying and screaming and, you know, my parents who are just wonderful were
 like, they prayed and then they were sort of like, we are going to take action.
 And I remember being about, I don't know, five or six years old, standing outside around an
 outdoor fire. And my parents are like, "We are going to burn this book in the name of Jesus."
 And you know what? I remember my sister giving me a bit of a glare across the fire because it was
 her book. Oh, oh. But I need to maybe apologize, Steph. Sorry Fiona, if you're watching this.
 I'll buy you another one. And, you know, the dreams, the nightmares stopped. And 20 years later,
 I was actually speaking on dreams and talking about, you know, how God speaks to us and suddenly
 God reminded me. I don't know if you've ever had this experience where you're speaking,
 and then God starts speaking to you. So your mouth is still your...
 Yes. (laughs)
 You're sort of listening, like, what was this?
 And suddenly the Holy Spirit begins speaking to me
 and saying, "Oh, remember last week
 you were sitting with your friend
 and saying, "I feel like men have a back door key
 to my heart and I am powerless to kind of say no
 or do anything about it.
 And I don't know what to do.
 I feel so trapped."
 And so he kind of replays this memory.
 And I'm sort of like, I'm talking about this nightmare.
 And what I'm now experiencing in life
 is the exact same thing.
 And God began speaking to me about that experience,
 that nightmare that I had as a child
 was birthed out of my belief system,
 about a scary experience I'd had
 as a child, a traumatic experience,
 which I had grown into a belief system,
 But then when my parents took action, I felt protected.
  </li><li>Right, okay.
  </li><li>But it lay dormant in life.
  </li><li>Until your parents are not the people standing beside you
 'cause you're older.
  </li><li>Yes.
 And now I begin to live it out as an adult.
 And I forgave, I repented,
 and that dynamic totally stopped in my life.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>And I was like, wow, God, you used a nightmare
 that I had when I was five years old to free me
 from a sort of a cycle of events
 that were happening in my 20s.
  </li><li>Wow, wow.
 So I have some questions based on some things that you said.
 So my first question is,
 how do you know if when you're having night tears,
 is there an easy way of knowing if it is your heart
 trying to get your attention or the Lord trying to get your attention or if it is demonic.
 I'm just trying to think like, I remember when I had, I've had nightmares most of my
 life and I wondered if that's because I'm a dreamer now.
 So scare you off of dreaming.
 Yes.
 You know that kind of thing.
 Definitely.
 So to me that seemed like a sort of easy this plus this means this.
 But when I was younger, I could wake up out of my night terrors.
 But after my dad killed himself, I had a season of about a year and a half probably
 where when I did fall asleep, I couldn't wake up.
 Like I needed my roommate to shake.
 Somebody had to shake me to get me out of the drink and I would scream and scream trying
 to get out.
 So to me, I'm like, those felt pretty demonic.
 Yes, I would agree with that.
 But are there other things like, are there any other things that you can go like, if
 If you notice this, you might want to realize there's probably some demonic at play.
 Is there anything else you would suggest looking for?
 Yes.
 I mean, there's lots of different things, but I would definitely say if people describe
 things like feeling like they are being attacked by demons, seeing dark shadowy figures, attacking
 them in their dreams, those are things that I would look for.
 know, a presence in the room might be something that I would be okay. And so my immediate
 action would be I would be, I'd be putting worship music on in my bedroom. I would be
 praying every night before I go to sleep. I would be asking the Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit,
 is there any reason why the demonic has access to me in this place and at this time, you
 anywhere I go, I pray in the bedroom before I sleep.
 Because there were a lot, especially when you go to hotels
 or I've had a few unfortunate motel experiences.
  </li><li>Yes, I have too.
  </li><li>And forgetting to pray one night before I went to sleep
 really has motivated me since then.
 I had this real encounter experience
 where I could see these eyes looking at me
 sing song voice calling out my name as I was asleep in this motel and it was such a dodgy
 dodgy motel and so I woke up out like this like just and was just like greater is he was in me
 than he is in the world like and it was I mean it was actually encouraging cuz scripture just came
 out of me like all those verses that you like memorize yes they came out of me like a punch you
 you know, and I was just like, wow, and immediately it left.
 And I was like, I did not pray in this room.
 So I'm like, Holy Spirit.
 Number one, I'm really sorry I didn't pray.
 Yeah. Okay.
 Holy Spirit comes and you're angels.
 And, you know, immediately, like God's presence there,
 then I turned over and went back to sleep
 and I wasn't bothered by it.
 The rest of the unfortunate time I had to stay in that room.
 But pray in your room.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>You know, make it a place by God's presence it is.
 And then begin to ask God,
 is there anything that's giving this access to me?
  </li><li>I used to also pray over the screen of my mind,
 like realizing, oh, that's where dreams are gonna,
 you know, play out for, you know.
 So I would literally go to bed each night saying,
 "Lord, I give you control over the screen of my mind."
 And I said, "Nothing's gonna be on that screen
 "that isn't written by you."
 And when I would remember to pray, I wouldn't have the dreams that I would get stuck in when I would
 during that season, when I would fall asleep, I would often get stuck in dreams.
 And then the further we got into the renewal and the more I got of the Holy Spirit,
 it just stopped happening, which was wonderful. But I just thought, you know,
 if people are listening to this and they do have night terrors and they're going,
 oh, well, maybe it's all me speaking or maybe they're thinking, oh, maybe it's all demonic.
 Or there's a combination.
  </li><li>How do we sieve through that
 and get what we're supposed to get?
  </li><li>Yes, I mean, if you're having recurring dreams
 or a recurring theme, that is often,
 I would say the acriety of your heart.
 There's quite a, there will be a strong push
 from your sort of internal life to communicate.
 Your heart is like, I'm part of you, I want to be heard.
 And often for really legitimate reasons,
 We sort of have to put that aside when we're small.
 We don't know how to process our pain and trauma,
 but it needs to be brought into the present
 and into healing.
  </li><li>Right.
 And many of us as adults have been trained to put aside
 our feelings, our hearts, our needs, all of that.
 So that makes a lot of sense to me that if we're trying
 to shove it all down, that eventually it's gonna come up
 and we're not in control of our dreams.
 So to the, yeah.
  </li><li>Oh, hello.
 Yes, and you know, as I don't know about you,
 but as I've grown in life and a maturity
 and all these things,
 I feel like I've got such freedom and such peace.
 Sort of in my sleep and I have such a positive expectation
 about going to sleep and expecting God to speak to me.
  </li><li>Yes, oh, for sure, I do as well.
 And I actually, well,
 I dream fairly differently, mostly,
 like, you know, fairly literally, but when I have other dreams, I actually talked to myself
 in my dream, like I'll be like, Oh, I don't want to dream this anymore.
 And I'll just, I don't know, I don't even know if that's normal, but I'll wake up, roll
 over and dream something different.
 But I just sort of were before I couldn't get out.
 Yeah.
 So yeah.
 Well, I think, you know, you have, you have a, you have a powerful gift within you, AJ.
 And the force is strong with you.
 Any Star Wars reference works for me.
 Yes.
 And let's see.
 I'm just communicating love right now.
 What's your number five?
 I think this is number five.
 We're ready.
 We're ready for number five.
 And number five is interpretation belongs to God.
 And that is what Joseph says.
 In Genesis when he's speaking to Pharaoh, he says, "Does not
 interpretation belong to God. And as Christians, when we, when we have dreams, we are expecting
 the Holy Spirit to speak to us. It's not just our mind, our intellect, our symbolic knowledge,
 but interpretation, true interpretation comes out of relationship with the Holy Spirit.
 It comes out of leaning in and trusting. We have a good, good Father who wants to speak
 to us. And he is the one, his spirit within us that will unlock the interpretation of the dream.
 Not our brilliant knowledge of symbols, not our formula, it is the Holy Spirit.
 And for those of us who may be like to A plus B equals C, that can be a little frustrating.
 That's me and that is a little frustrating.
 Yeah, but yeah.
 Exactly.
 Exactly.
 And I think when you get your dreams, which are fantastic and clear.
 How about because God knows I don't have the patience for flowy.
 I like rules.
 I know you do.
 And I enjoy that about you.
 I was complaining one time to the Lord as one can do about why do I only
 get symbolic dreams. Like why do I just get the most symbolic-y metaphorical, parabolic
 dreams? I was just having a little wine. And the Lord spoke to me so clearly and he said,
 "Sarek, if I gave you very clear dreams, you would have never bothered to learn how
 to interpret dreams. Your symbolic dreams were an invitation." And I was like, "Oh, I love
  </li><li>Oh, that makes sense.
  </li><li>It's an invitation into the heart of God.
 And I love it.
 It excites me.
 I just seeing, you know, we were interpreting dreams
 with your school, the year one and year two today.
 And just this moment when there are these
 and supernatural heavenly encounters
 where people are weeping, cheering, crying,
 God's in the room.
 I'm just, ah.
  </li><li>Oh, you can feel it.
 My office is in the room.
 I can't hear what you're saying.
 I'm having a meeting
 and I'm feeling the Holy Spirit in our little building.
 And I'm like, I don't know what they're doing out there,
 but this is like getting intense in my office
 while I'm having this little meeting.
 But I also think you have fought for your understanding
 and your gift in terms of, you know,
 with dream interpretation.
 And, you know, in addition to that,
 you're an incredibly prophetic person anyway.
 but you're contagious in terms of
 you make people excited about understanding something
 that seems like it can seem overwhelming.
  </li><li>It really can, 'cause most of us are not so conversant
 with speaking symbolic language
 and understanding symbolism and sort of listening
 to the Holy Spirit while someone's talking
 and asking questions.
 I mean, really you talk about curiosity.
 And I think actually developing a heart of curiosity
 is just such a high value if you want to grow
 in understanding and interpreting dreams,
 asking questions, oh, you know,
 what does that person mean to you?
 Oh, what was the strongest emotion in the dream?
 Oh, you know, is there any way in your life
 that the events of this dream resonate with you?
 Is there any way in your life that,
 you know, you're experiencing this emotion right now.
 and just listening for those questions
 and asking them and seeing what the Holy Spirit unlocks
 is very exciting.
  </li><li>Oh, I love it.
 I have a couple of additional questions.
 So the first one is this.
 I'm thinking in terms of the prophetic,
 you know how you build a language with the Lord.
 And so sometimes there's certain pictures that I have
 that the moment I see that picture,
 I know exactly what God is referring to.
 I'm looking for the details inside that picture
 in order to give the prophetic word,
 because, but I know this visual to me always means that.
 Now, I'm always still asking the question, right?
 So I'm still saying, so God, I'm, you know,
 and you're doing it quickly internally
 while you're still probably given the other part
 of your prophetic word.
 I'm seeing this, is it this, is it this, is it this,
 is it this, good?
 And then you, you know, is it like that with dreams?
 Do you build, do you find that you build a language
 with God in terms of, I'm not talking about interpreting
 other people's dreams, but within your own dreams,
 because, so this is me saying,
 you're the dream person, I'm not, okay?
 So inside of your own, I know that like,
 if you were to tell me a dream,
 and you had a dream about a purple elephant,
 it doesn't matter what a purple elephant means to me,
 it matters what it means to you, right?
 So do you ever find that you, like, within yourself,
 you'll dream about the same sort of thing
 and you know what that is because you've built a language
 with the Lord or does it not really work exactly
 like that with dreams?
  </li><li>It's a great question.
 I think some of that is a little more personality dependent.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I feel-- - That's a good idea.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>You do some people are very systematic
 and organized in their thinking
 in a way that enables them to access information
 in a phenomenally fast way.
  </li><li>Ah. (laughs)
  </li><li>Those people, I've talked to several people
 who that it's almost how they store information
 in their mind palace.
  </li><li>Oh, that's interesting.
  </li><li>I often have a sense,
 and I do have perhaps a little lexicon like that,
 but it wouldn't be how I store information internally.
  </li><li>Okay, so that makes sense.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I mean, God knows us.
 We operate so uniquely in other ways.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So.
  </li><li>That's so cool.
  </li><li>Okay.
 You're not alone.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But it that way I've met several others,
 but it's not how I do it.
  </li><li>Oh, that's so cool.
 All right.
 So now to put you on the spot.
 Not to interpret a dream.
 I don't have a fresh one for you.
  </li><li>Although I did dream something recently
 that I wrote down, I thought,
 I must have Sarah about this.
 I remember once years and years ago,
 I'd had this crazy dream,
 and I remember you were sort of just getting
 into dream interpretation, I thought.
 There is no chance that this is anything other than pizza.
 Like, there's not a chance, it was so insane.
 And so I remember coming in and reading you
 the whole dream, and then you started with your,
 I wonder if, and I wonder if, and by the end,
 I'm like bawling, and I was like,
 "Oh, I didn't think that, I wasn't God-ding at all."
 But are there like, can you think of no more than five, but just off the top of your heads, like,
 hey, it's not helpful to do this. When you're interpreting dreams, try not to. Are there any
 try not to? Okay. Yes, for sure. So that might look like when you're interpreting a dream,
 ask questions, try not to put your interpretation sort of, and your understanding and your response
 to symbols on another person. You know, you, you, you, they may have a dream with a dog
 and you're like, dogs, oh, smooshy, whooshy, I love them little puppy puppies. And so you
 might just be like, oh, well, clearly it's this and it's your best friend and the Lord
 is drawing clothes. And they're looking at you with eyes of terror, because their experience
 of dogs is being savaged by dogs or just terrifying. So don't ask questions. Don't assume good.
 another don't would be where we confuse
 we're interpreting a symbolic dream.
 And then there's a little part of the symbolic dream
 that we really quite like.
 So we decide that that's not symbolic.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>So you know, so you're sort of like,
 well, you know, I just dreamt that the person I really like.
 There was a, he was, you know,
 riding on a giant purple elephant.
 And then we arrived at a chapel and we got married.
 And then, and we're like, clearly that means
 We're going to be married and you're like, wait, wait, wait, wait.
 We are purple.
 I wasn't giant purple elephant in your dream.
 And you know, that's not a great example, but we can, we can, we can look at dreams
 with idols in our heart.
 Yeah.
 So good.
 Just like when we, you know, hear God's voice, when we, we look at the interpretation
 and instead of relying on the Holy Spirit, this is kind of a two-parter, don't we, we
 we look at it with our own filter of desire.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And we're like, oh, well, I want that.
 Well, surely that dream means that's the thing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Rather than relying on the Holy Spirit.
  </li><li>Right.
 And then probably with those dreams,
 we don't actually share them around very much
 'cause we don't actually wanna hear a different.
  </li><li>Oh, no, 'cause you don't want your interpretation
 challenged because it is giving you the thing.
  </li><li>Definitely about that thing.
  </li><li>Absolutely, yes.
  </li><li>Yes, cool.
 Is there any other off the top of your heads?
 Don't say those are like the mean.
  </li><li>My, probably my main other one would be
 every interpretation just like any way
 that you hear God's voice always lines up
 with the, with scripture and with the person,
 character and nature of God.
 So there's not, there's not gonna be an interpretation
 to a dream that's like, oh go out and steal.
 Yeah, it's okay to make that choice.
  </li><li>Yes, right.
 that any interpretation that brings you into conflict
 with a scripture or the character and nature of Jesus
 is an interpretation that needs to be discarded.
  </li><li>Oh, so good.
 Well, thank you so much.
  </li><li>Oh, it's a...
 Would you pray for everyone?
 Just for whatever you want, more dreams.
  </li><li>Whatever I want.
  </li><li>I want to catch you.
  </li><li>Well, you know, whatever, you do you.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I trust you.
 I'm gonna receive.
 Shaka-da-pra-as.
 Father, I thank you that you are the creator of dreams.
 You created us to dream, and you are the one who speaks to us in the night seasons.
 And Father, I ask tonight that you would release an incredible impartation of understanding
 that people would operate in the spirit of wisdom and revelation,
 that there would be a deeper understanding of the dreams you've given us.
 There would be a new level that we operate in and God that we would have this boldness
 to tackle dreams, to ask for dreams, to speak up and start interpreting dreams
 and hearing your voice in a new way.
 Father, we ask for that in Jesus' name.
 Amen.
 Amen.
 Well, thank you so much.
 My great pleasure.
 What a joy to be here.
 I, you know, I see you on my screen popping up all the time.
 And now I'm actually here in your studio.
