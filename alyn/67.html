<p> AJ Jones, how the heck are you?<br/>
 Oh, I'm doing wonderful.<br/>
 I have a slight cold.<br/>
 My AJ, what device you have.<br/>
 Just kidding.<br/>
 It's me.<br/>
 Shall we talk about what's happening?<br/>
 I guess so.<br/>
 Welcome to episode 67 of keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones is sick.<br/>
 She took some pain relief medicine last night, had a horribly bad allergic reaction to it
 and has been out for the count.<br/>
 That's why I never take unlabeled drug.
 Sorry.<br/>
 It was just hippie nonsense.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And anyway, I won't go into details about what happened, but she's not good.
 So I asked our good friend Josh Parsons, whose wife Sarah is also sick.
 If he would come over and stand in for AJ.
 I believe you said, bro night on the podcast, I think I could have misread that.
 I could have been a different.<br/>
 Do you know what?<br/>
 It's called a football.<br/>
 Let's just talk college football.<br/>
 Oh, that's right.<br/>
 I love sports teams.<br/>
 Me and you should do this for the podcast or people who don't like.
 Absolutely.<br/>
 I love it.<br/>
 Usually at the start of the week, we catch up on our week.
 So how was your week?<br/>
 I had a good week.<br/>
 It was a a busy week, but good.<br/>
 What was the highlight of your week?<br/>
 OK, I'm going to nerd out about some things, but I've been learning all about
 this program called planning center.<br/>
 And is that like a fertility program?<br/>
 It is.<br/>
 So I have to take these weird pills, which, like I said, I only do the late.
 I'm just kidding.<br/>
 No, it is a.<br/>
 So if we have any worship pastors or worship leaders listening, planning center is your friend.
 It's, uh, it's this basically software program that kind of does your scheduling for you.
 You just input names and, you know, songs and things like that.
 And it just makes it easier.<br/>
 So, you know, it for scheduling, for doing set lists.
 And then there's this other cool thing that goes with planning center that
 allows you to see your set list with your charts and everything on an iPad.
 And you can link the iPads for everyone on stage and switch songs all at the same
 time. That's even if you use charts, but I don't know.
 It's the beginning stages of something cool.
 Am I right in thinking that you never used to be that into computers and technology or is that a judgment?
 No, you're right.<br/>
 I, uh, I had a flip phone till about a few years ago and how, how are we from friends?
 Well, uh, I think you reached out to me as like an evangelistic type thing.
 Right.<br/>
 You were lost.<br/>
 Exactly.<br/>
 And now you have an iPhone and iPad and a Mac and a Mac.
 Yeah.<br/>
 It is to max a 2008 or 2009 Mac.<br/>
 So I'm probably due for an upgrade.<br/>
 You are absolutely good upgrade.<br/>
 Do you want to know the highlight my week was?
 I do.<br/>
 I'd love to know the highlight of your week.
 A highlight of our week.<br/>
 I think I speak for AJ Jones in this particular situations.
 We had dinner with a very wonderful Lyle Nelson Phillips on Tuesday night.
 I love Lyle and Allison.<br/>
 And Lyle's been on our podcast before, but let's imagine we have people who don't know
 who Lyle and Allison are.<br/>
 Describe Lyle and Allison Phillips to us.
 Well, first of all, they're probably probably one of the most beautiful couples
 that the Lord has blessed with his beauty.
 That's that works as a sentence.<br/>
 Um, so Lyle is a pastor.<br/>
 He and Allison are both the pastors at Iris, Iris Nashville,
 church here in town.<br/>
 And somebody told me after Lyle spoke, they're like, even the
 lazy laziest of people could want to go and change the world after listening to
 Lyle.<br/>
 Absolutely.<br/>
 They just have this contagious energy and passion for the Lord and for the lost.
 And I just had baby Isaiah.<br/>
 They did.<br/>
 Who's gorgeous.<br/>
 So cute.<br/>
 Have you noticed the Lyle and me share some physical attributes?
 Absolutely.<br/>
 Cause you guys both do CrossFit, right?
 Well, mine's all natural.<br/>
 Like my physique, athletic build, just natural.
 I mean, seriously, I can just eat Cheetos and I look like this.
 Exactly.<br/>
 Lyle has to just be CrossFit every single day.
 Who's the king of periscope?<br/>
 I would definitely say Lyle.<br/>
 He he is on a periscope, at least once a day, and he's good.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I'm I'm too nervous to use periscope.<br/>
 I agree.<br/>
 I made one video and it was of my dog and I didn't say a word.
 My wife told me if for anyone to watch this, you at least say something like, hi, I'm playing with my dog.
 Check her out.<br/>
 She's cute.<br/>
 Instead, it was just this quiet video of my dog chewing on a stick.
 dick in the yard, I thought, well, this is interesting.
</p><ul>
  <li>I can't believe I missed that.
  </li><li>Well, it was easy to miss.
  </li><li>Yeah, so Lyle and Allison Phillips,
 checking out on Instagram, Periscope, Twitter,
 it's social media takeover really.
 Our, Micah John, our two year old who's gonna be three,
 is gonna preschool this week.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>So this week was going in and filling in
 all the forms and meeting his teacher,
 and he loves it every day, he's asked to go to school,
 which is exciting.
  </li><li>Oh, that's great.
  </li><li>And then I guess the only other two things
 We got up to this week was I spoke twice or I guess three times this week Monday night
 Ammonate on the church and yes this morning on honor. Oh, so good
 But you also played worship both times I spoke I did is there ever something that you haven't played in worship?
 If I'm not there usually I'm not playing but
 Sorry, so no, so well not so much. I mean
 Yeah, the goal isn't to play every time but
 I just enjoy it so much and you really do.
 I can't ask to play.
 So who asked you?
 Because I aren't either worship pastor.
 I am now, but I didn't used to be.
 Yeah, I just would get scheduled by whoever was leading.
 And so that's how it happened a whole lot.
 I've been a great.
 How long have you been a great singer?
 Uh, five years this month.
 And you've been playing on the worship team for four and a half.
 About four and three quarters.
 Right.
 So my question is you guys make it look like it's magic up there.
 I get the okay we're playing a song and we're singing the song I get that right I get that most of our musicians are super talented.
 Can all play by ear right and so they can just play the song the magic that happens is of course doing some bit between songs or when you guys go in the prophetic flow.
 To me about what that's what was that like to begin with because you're an accomplished musician was that easy with just another expression of musical creativity or is it like what is happening.
 I think for me, I think I was fortunate to learn guitar in a way where I learned.
 by ear and less by learning notes on a page and right.
 You know, playing what I see. So I would play what I feel or play what I hear. And there were. So I, you know, used to just practice along to whatever I was listening to at the time when I was in high school, which was not the greatest music, but I did get a few
 Leonard Skinner and Beatles albums, which helped me with my chops.
 Thanks, dad.
 And, uh, but I would just rather than like getting a char or a tab or, uh,
 you know, cord sheet, I would just play along and try to try to learn what I was
 hearing.
 Right.
 And, but I didn't, I kind of thought that everybody else learned that way too.
 And then I would meet musicians, uh, more classical musicians, like somebody who
 played cello.
 And they were asking about playing in worship and they were like, well,
 do you have music printed out?" And I was like, "No, we just play along to the song."
 She's like, "How do you know what to play?" That was the first time I think that I thought,
 "Oh, you don't just like hear something? I'm play along." Right. So, when I first started playing
 guitar at like age 12, my dad was a pastor and he and my mom led worship a lot at our church.
 And as soon as we knew like a few chords, they were like, "Oh, you're going to play with us on Sunday."
 And so they just had us playing along and a lot of times it was ad-libbing a lot of times it was my dad.
 Was I would say now was a very prophetic worship leader.
 I don't know that he ever planned to set.
 I think he maybe would just, you know, back then it was him's so he'd maybe pick two or three.
 But then he would flow in and out of different things too.
 So that all makes sense.
 Everything you've just said makes sense.
 Yeah.
 But that's you.
 Yeah, and there's six or seven other people on the platform.
 So it would make sense if you're just doing a solo and you could just go in and out,
 but seven of you are not communicating and you're all flowing and sometimes
 our prophetic spontaneous songs are 15, 20 minutes long.
 Yeah.
 And they're amazing.
 How do you know what you're doing?
 I think I think it's kind of like if you think of music as a language,
 it's almost like talking.
 Like so if if if worship via music,
 is a form of giving your thanks to the Lord.
 And we're like speaking in tongues.
 I think there's a certain element of you just play.
 And there is a certain order to it.
 Like we'll try and give signals.
 So like if we try to leave space,
 but rather than everybody just play whatever they're feeling all at once,
 we try to have it.
 I mean, sometimes that happens.
 And sometimes it happens that we end up playing the same thing,
 which is good. Other times, if somebody gets something, the rest of the band will kind of support
 what that person has got. Does that make sense? Totally makes sense. I never thought of it like
 that. So if you think of it in terms of like, so if somebody, you know, music in a way,
 everything is context. So there's a context of the key that you're in. There's a context of the
 tempo, there's the context of the feeling in the room, whether in a major key or a minor key.
 And so if there's this really uplifting time in the room, or it just feels like God's presence
 is there and joy is being released or something, you're probably not going to go into some minor
 cord dirge, you know, right?
 We're all just worms in the dirt, you know?
 So there's an element of like that feeling of it.
 And then if music is the language that you have to express that, I don't know,
 you just kind of know.
 That makes a lot of sense.
 So when you said it's like a conversation, like if I go to a dinner
 party and there's seven other people there, I'm not worried about how the
 conversation is going to go.
 I'm not waiting for the script.
 It's like, how did you plan what to say?
 But you just didn't take it in turns and it was something you might say might inspire me to say something different than what I'm going to say exactly.
 I never thought of that.
 I didn't either.
 That must have been the Holy Spirit.
 What do you think it takes?
 Do you think it takes obviously musical ability?
 But but I know musicians who wouldn't be able to move outside the framework of what's on the sheet of paper.
 But so what do you think the key ingredients are in being able to flow like that?
 Sarah and I were just out at worship you at Bethel in July and they were talking about some of
 their core values and stuff. And one of them was excellence. And I forget who said it. I'm so sorry
 if I'm butchering your quote, if you're listening, but it was something along the lines of,
 don't let your lack of skill limit what God wants to do. So on the one hand, there's excellence.
 And then on the other hand, you don't want your skill that you've developed to hinder what God wants to do if he wants to do something outside of what you've learned.
 Right.
 So then the... So there's excellence. And then I think on the other hand, there's risk because stepping out is a risky thing.
 You know, what if it's wrong?
 Yeah, what if it's in the wrong... And I've done that before.
 I've stepped out in the wrong key and wrong time signature and probably in the wrong place.
 Yeah, I would say it takes a certain level of excellence to be able to confidently take that
 risk because I think confidence is the other thing because it's like praying. If you start
 praying and everything you say you feel unsure about or,
 you know, other people will have a hard time
 kind of attaching their faith to your prayer versus
 if you're like, the Lord's given me something
 and I'm gonna step out and play it.
 I don't know.
 Does that make sense?
 It does, totally does.
 So like risk and excellence and then with excellence,
 a certain level of confidence.
 'Cause I've met musicians who are incredibly excellent
 but aren't confident.
 They're confident in certain aspects or certain.
 Uh,
 surroundings, certain atmospheres, like if it's all planned out,
 but if it got to a point where it was like, yeah, just play what you feel.
 They wouldn't know what to do because they've been used to playing what they're
 told or playing with the read or I'm pretty sure you told me this, but I might
 be wrong, but I remember you were talking about the first time, first few times
 you started playing with Alberto and Kimberly Rivera.
 So for people who might not be familiar with Alberto and Kimberly Rivera,
 I'm so sorry that you have not experienced them.
 Stop what you're doing right now.
 Go find some other stuff and iTunes and buy it.
 Truly amazing.
 And so Alberto and Kimberly are incredible musicians,
 like in and of themselves, incredible musicians.
 They also flow in the Holy Spirit, like few other people I've met.
 So just to kind of set that up, you're an incredible musician.
 You also know how to flow with the Holy Spirit.
 But I'm imagining this or did you tell me that when you first started playing with
 them, you suddenly realized I'm at my depth and I might have just used words so you might
 not be comfortable with?
 No, not at all.
 I still feel out of my depth whenever I play with them.
 Like I would say I'm more comfortable now.
 And some of that comes from probably knowing what to expect.
 But the first few times, yeah, like you said, they are just, they're just on a different
 length. And I mean that like in a good way and an honoring way. Like, so if you had a bunch of
 people in a room like speaking in tongues together and it was like, now you're going to respond to
 what they said in tongues, but you're still unsure about like how to do it or what it's for or whatever.
 That's kind of like how I felt the first time I played with Alberto, because he started playing
 something that was almost like a salsa beat. He plays keys. So like this salsa bossa nova movement
 type thing on keys and singing something. I was kind of looking down and looking around
 and thinking, "Where do I fit?" What key are we in?
 For now, I've gotten to the point where I feel like I can keep up
 Alberto challenges me on this a lot. I kind of stay in the parameters of what I know.
 I'm like, oh, I know I can do this.
 Excellently.
 And so I'll try and do that.
 But he's consistently, he's one of those people that is consistently pushing you to.
 He's like, don't think about the music.
 Just play just worship with your instrument.
 I don't know why he sounded like speedy Gonzalez.
 When I said that, but he's yeah.
 When you talk about pushing the envelope, those guys push the envelope.
 Oh, they absolutely do.
 But they're unbelievable, aren't they?
 I don't know.
 Incredible.
 and every like them. I don't know how she can sing like she sings from a sitting down position.
 Yeah. I don't either. I don't know how he can play how he plays without ever looking at his fingers.
 I know that's rudimentary, but he can play in. I mean, he's just got to be one of the most talented piano players ever.
 But every time I look at my, I'm like, at least look at your fingers, at least make it look the slightest bit complex.
 Yeah. Yeah. But they're, they're just incredible.
 So that to me, that would be like, like he speaks Portuguese and English, but he's fluent in music.
 And so he can say anything at any time in music.
 Whereas I might, I'm like, oh, I'm still learning the language.
 So I can say these phrases where he's just like, Oh, no, I'm fluent in this.
 That's a very good way of going to judge.
 You're not going to have the park with this.
 Oh, thank you.
 And I, you know, I'm starting a Twitter with my own quotes.
 It's not really.
 All right, you mentioned you're a worship you a battle.
 Yes.
 Those guys were amazing, aren't they?
 Oh, it's so it.
 Yes.
 All of them are incredible.
 Talk to me about your top and the new your common players.
 So this might send you a statement.
 Top four things that you were personally impacted by top four things.
 Help people understand.
 I'm pretty sure everybody who listens to this podcast knows about battle, but they might
 not be familiar with worship you.
 with what is worship you, what does it look like? Just give us a brief outline.
 So worship you, I heard about it maybe a year or two ago, a couple years ago, and it's always
 intrigued me. But basically, it's a two-week program for anybody who's involved in worship or
 wants to be, whether you play an instrument, whether you're a worship leader, whether you're a pastor,
 whether you're a dancer, you are an artist, like a painter.
 And you basically go for two weeks
 and you spend glorious amounts of time in worship
 with people from Bethel, like Brian and Jen and Amanda Cook
 and Jeremy Riddles, Stephanie Gretzinger,
 like everybody, all of those amazing people.
  </li><li>So they're leading worship over there.
  </li><li>So they're leading worship,
 but then they have guests in,
 like people that are friends of theirs,
 like Leland or John Mark McMillan or Jonathan and Melissa Helser, which of course, you know,
 we love them. So, you know, it's all these incredible people. They're leading worship.
 And then there, a lot of them are speaking on things as well. And they'll speak on topics such as
 walking under authority, growing your team, like everything from the super practical to
 super spiritual, like without a conquer fear and doubt when you're writing, how to, you
 know, just abiding in the Holy Spirit and prophetic worship, things like that.
 And you had classes all day?
 We had classes from, we worship would start around 10 a.m. in the morning.
 And there were, I think, like four classes every day that were required for everyone to
 be there and then the whole afternoon and evening was filled with electives.
 So that's where you would have more specific classes like beginners dance, flag waving,
 painting, guitar parts for Bethel, bass parts for Bethel's song.
 So you can actually go in and sit in classes where the musicians who recorded all those
 parts were sitting there and saying, "Oh, here's how you play that line."
 And you know, here's two guitar players.
 Here's how we write parts to compliment one another.
 And if you have two guitar players on your team, you can do that too.
 You know, wow.
 So just create like basically just stewarding everything that God has given them incredibly
 well and then giving it away, which is it just blows my mind.
 So we, I mean, we went because I wanted to go last year just for fun.
 And then this year, I think we talked about before where we were asked to be the worship
 and creative arts pastors here at the church at Grace Center.
 Surprise!
 Yeah.
 And I thought, gosh, I really don't want to screw this up.
 So I'm going to get as much wisdom as I possibly can from worship you because they do so many
 of these things so well.
 And so back to your original question about like top four things.
 One of the things was their excellence level.
 Someone and I were talking about this the other day.
 You feel like you know a lot about a person when you walk into their house that you see
 what they value.
 So if their house is really nice and they have nice furniture and things are in order,
 they probably don't have to ask you not to put your feet on the table.
 You know what I mean?
 Because you walk in and you see the things that they value in your surroundings.
 So that's how I felt when I went there, like the stage and everything was super well lit
 and just the whole presentation of it.
 Like in terms of life languages, they must have very high producers.
 Because it was just amazing.
 So everything looked amazing and then the sound, the mix was incredible.
 And there was no question of like, oh, do you think they practice?
 like everything, I mean, it wasn't like it was, you know, perfection for the sake of
 perfection. It was perfection because they know that they're presenting something, you
 know what I mean?
 So like people are coming to worship and so they want to present A, their worship to the
 Lord that is excellent and B, allow people to join in something that's excellent. Does
 that make sense?
 Yeah, it does.
 Yeah, the excellence level across the board and just the way everybody, everybody who spoke, everybody who led worship, you know, everybody that was there.
 It didn't seem like there was any question of whether or not they were supposed to be there.
 You know what I mean?
 So that was which kind of leads me to one of the other things that stood out to me was the identity piece.
 Like everybody seemed to have their identity just rooted in the Lord and everything that they did.
 It felt like was just like an outflow of that identity.
 It wasn't like they were trying to like so if a person was speaking, it didn't ever feel like they were having to convince themselves while they were speaking that they should be speaking.
 You know what I mean?
 It was just like, oh, I'm speaking and because the Lord has made me awesome and because he's awesome and he's inside me.
 So therefore I have something valuable to say, you know what I mean?
 And no arrogance about it, but just I just felt like I was listening with such
 I took like over a hundred pages of notes because I was just like, this is so amazing.
 I mean, there was one point where I thought he could have said, it's good to tie your
 shoes every day.
 And I would have written it down thinking, what is this wisdom I have never heard before?
 You know, it was just so good.
 Um, yeah, so those two things were incredible.
 Excellent identity.
 I think one of the other things that I was really impacted by was that so many of
 them, so Brian and Jen and obviously, uh, Bill and Benny Eric, they've all been
 at that church for years.
 So I remember, uh, the first day being in worship and, you know, I've been a worship
 pastor for 12 minutes, I think, when we walked in.
 And so the first day we walk in,
 and I'm just, I feel like super excited, like,
 oh my gosh, Lord, if it was your will to do anything
 like this, you know, the production level, all of that.
 If you wanted to bring any of that back to our church,
 I am willing, you know?
 And their first worship said,
 I just thought there's no way we can do this.
 This is so, this is way too good, you know?
 This is who am I but a worm in the dirt,
 I should not be a worship pastor.
 And I remember it was,
 I don't even know what it was related to,
 but Brian said, man, we've been doing this 15 years now
 and this year just feels amazing.
 And immediately I was like, oh, you've been doing this 15 years.
 I can cut myself some slack.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>A, I can cut myself some slack and B,
 I don't need to feel the pressure to churn out this type of result that is that you've
 been building for 15 years.
 But with that, one of the things that I was so struck by, so I grew up in a church environment
 where if the church didn't like the pastor, they could vote you out.
 So my dad was a pastor and he didn't get voted out a lot.
 Well, he didn't get voted out at all.
 other churches their pastor would like get voted out
 and then my dad would get hired at that church or something.
 Does that make sense?
 So we just moved around a lot when we were little.
 And so I had never,
 kind of thinking about I think this church,
 well, there was one church when I was a kid
 that I was at for like six years,
 but I would say our church now is one of the churches
 I've been at the longest.
 I just thought all churches were like that.
 I thought everybody just moved around
 and churches switched pastors a lot and stuff.
 So when Brian, when Bill was talking about
 how all of them had been there for like 30 years,
 in fact, Danny Silk showed a video of his wedding
 where Chris Valatin was there
 and Bill Johnson and Benny were singing at the wedding
 and stuff and I just thought,
 you guys have all, you guys have so much history.
 So that was, I would say that's the third thing that impacted me so much was just the history that was there.
 It was just amazing.
 And I think for the first time I thought, oh, being a pastor doesn't mean you're going to have to move a lot or you're going to be shipped from place to place kind of thing.
 I don't know.
 This is all the things I'm still working out in now being a pastor.
 So really.
 Let's see.
 fourth thing, everyone was super nice, so nice.
 I got to meet a lot of people, which was great, but they were all so kind.
 That's good to know, isn't it?
 It really, I was really impacted by it, like, oh, you know, and I'd say, oh, I'm from Nashville.
 Oh, we love Nashville.
 You know, just everybody had kind things.
 There was one person that they said, where are you from?
 And I said, I'm from Nashville.
 And they're like, oh, do you think you're better than everyone?
 And I was like, I couldn't tell if they were joking.
 Turns out they were joking,
 but I just didn't get their dry sense of humor.
 And I was so worried that I would offend someone
 that I just was like, no.
 Who told you that?
 No, I don't think.
 And then I realized they were kidding.
 Like, oh, okay.
  </li><li>Dude, I got some listeners questions for you.
  </li><li>Oh, absolutely.
  </li><li>I don't think you can answer the first one,
 but I'm pretty sure you can answer the second one.
 Okay, the first one says this.
 This is from Jordan.
 He says, "Good evening or morning or afternoon.
 My name is Jordan and I'm writing you from the oven that is Dallas Fort Worth.
 Yeah, I don't think we got anything to complain about in Nashville.
 I've been to Dallas.
 It was 94 degrees today high of.
 Yeah.
 I wonder what it was in Dallas, probably harder.
 My wife and I are huge fans of the podcast.
 Thank you so much.
 We really appreciate your ministry and how you communicate the way you do life.
 Alan mentioned a nervous or mental breakdown in his early twenties.
 And I was curious as to whether there's an episode regarding this experience.
 And I missed it.
 Or if you're all planning to do an episode regarding this topic in the future.
 Love you guys keep the good work well Jordan thank you so much for your very kind question.
 My whole breakdown in my early twenties is something I regularly include in a lot of
 the teaching that I do it's like a test that I talk about when I teach but I have never
 really taught in that whole experience per se.
 I did look through all our episodes episode 42 talks about how I got saved and how I met
 the Holy Spirit which is a much better story.
 This is the one you want me to answer.
 Yeah if you go basically Alan's body shut down.
 So yeah, I'm sorry, we don't have a specific episode in that.
 Maybe we'll talk about it some point.
 Maybe that would be helpful for people.
 I have a second question here from Nathan.
 He asked this question.
 He says, "I heard the teachings on the church, part one and two.
 These are the teachings we did at emanate,
 which I found very powerful and encouraging,
 but some questions were raised.
 I bet they were.
 I got lots of questions,
 and I really appreciate the questions that people wrote in.
 I'm going to do my best to get back to you.
 I have no plans to leave my church,
 and I try and pray for my best to submit to Godly authority.
 Yeah, I need wisdom to know when it's healthy or not.
 My questions are, and I wanna hear your answers, Josh.
 Question one and two are pretty much the same,
 but question one is,
 how do you know if the church you're attending
 is abusive in its authority?
 And it may be healthier to leave the church
 for a place of greater health and life.
 And question two is,
 how do I distinguish when I'm not submitting
 to Godly authority or God's process versus,
 is this church potentially derailing me or being abusive?
  </li><li>That is a really good question.
  </li><li>These are the questions I get.
  </li><li>These are the questions I get.
 Can you repeat the question one more time?
 I was thinking about Hebrews 13, 17.
 It says obey your leaders.
 And on face value, that's terrifying for a lot of people.
 But the Greek word used for obey there is "patho,"
 which means allow yourself to be persuaded by.
 So my test is, do your leaders enforce control?
 Or do they give you input and then give you
 the freedom to make your own decisions?
 That's a great point.
 So from my perspective, I have enough trouble managing my own life without
 trying to manage other people's lives.
 And so I'm glad and willing to give input to people
 with the understanding that it's their life and they're seeking me out for
 council. So I'll give you you don't have to follow it.
 Yeah. But I'm privileged that you'd include me in the decision making
 process, but it's not my job to make you do something.
 And, you know, occasionally in the years I've been pastoring, I might turn up the volume on
 on what I'm saying, because I'm either thinking you're not hearing me or you don't realize how
 bad a decision this is going to be. But at the end of the day, I absolutely realize this is your
 decision to make. And it's not my job to control you. And I think that's a good difference.
 And it goes on to say in that same verse, let them do this. So let them lead you. The
 onus is on you to let them do it. So they don't. So I'm fully aware that in the people that I'm
 leading the people that I'm pastoring, it's not my job to tell them what to do. Right. It's their
 job to let me lead them. Right. And so if they don't want to be led by me, in one sense, that's
 that's not my job to to to make that happen. I think something that you said a minute ago about
 I think a good way to know if your leaders are abusive would be, are they enforcing their leadership
 onto you, or are they inviting you to be "governed" by their leadership?
 Because an invitation is much different than a being forced.
 I think that's a good point because as leaders, it's tough because I've been a leader in the
 church for a little while and it's really difficult to want the best for people and sometimes want
 the best for people more than they want it. And so I would say there is an actual struggle sometimes
 to not move into controlling people's decisions like, "Gosh, would you just do this? You can't see
 see it, but I can see how this will help you.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know what I mean?
 So, but you consistently have to hold your hands back
 and say, this is actually your life.
 This isn't my job to control you or decide for you.
 I can only present either information
 or if you ask me for help, I can help you,
 but you have to decide what to do with it.
  </li><li>Right, the good news is I don't think there's a thin line
 between an honoring leader and an ungodly leader.
 I think there's a chasm.
 So a lot of the stories that I've heard from people
 who think, I don't know if my leader's abusive or not,
 as soon as you hear the story, you're like,
 oh dear God, that's absolute abuse.
 You know what people are saying, hey,
 if you don't do this, then you're not
 gonna see gonna lift off your life.
 If you don't do this, you know, God's gonna,
 you're just like, that is so manipulative,
 that's so controlling, that's so clearly
 not the heart of God.
 But sometimes when you're in the midst of it,
 You get caught up in it, which is why it's really, really good to have outside council.
 Exactly.
 And people who are not vested either way.
 Yeah.
 I think that's great.
 All right.
 You ready for question three?
 What does it look like to build a better church when church culture is toxic while still
 being humble, honoring broken people and leaders and in the will of God?
 This is a really great question.
 Super easy to answer to.
 Absolutely.
  </li><li>Honestly, it's something that I thought about a lot
 because I used to play guitar for a living
 and I would travel all over the country
 and play in different churches.
 And so I'd be in a lot of different church environments.
 And like I said before, my dad was a pastor,
 so I grew up in a lot of different church environments
 'cause we moved around a lot.
 I think in all of that, so I've been playing guitar
 about 20 years and I've been traveling,
 like playing guitar for probably 16 years.
 And in all that time, I've not seen a perfect church.
 You know, and you guys have been all over the world.
 I don't think that there is a perfect church.
 I think at some point you have to decide,
 God, are you calling me to this church?
 Is this my home?
 And if so, what's my role here?
 Is it just to submit and go and whatever?
 Great, is it to invest in my community
 and the people around me?
 Great, and I think it's much easier
 to point fingers and criticize than it is
 to actually do something about it.
 And sometimes doing something about it
 is just being a nice person.
 Like, if a person complains that their church,
 that they don't do community well or something,
 well, what if you just always believed the best
 about you and your leaders and the people around you
 and you had people over for dinner once a month.
 And then they did the same.
 After a couple of years,
 your tour is just doing community really well.
 You know what I mean?
 (laughing)
 So I think it's that whole thing
 about being part of a solution
 rather than consistently just pointing at the problem.
 And it's difficult.
 Sometimes it's an uphill climb.
 But I think if you position in your heart
 to just focus on Jesus
 and be a part of the solution,
 and even if it's super small steps,
 like being a nice person
 or inviting people over to dinner
 or just not complaining
 or not giving ear to someone who is complaining
 about something they don't like.
 'Cause gossip and people talking about how unhappy they are,
 That just grows like a poison ivy or something.
  </li><li>That's really good.
 I've been thinking about building about a church a lot.
 The last two weeks of study for teaching in the church
 just got me so excited about the church.
 So thrilled I'm a church leader.
 Like I absolutely love it.
 I just ordered a bunch of books off Amazon.
 I've read my third book this week about churches.
  </li><li>That's amazing.
  </li><li>Oh, I'm just loving it.
 And so I've been thinking a lot about this.
 It's a great question.
 I think whenever you talk about a church being toxic,
 it's probably time to find a new church.
 But before you do that,
 it's probably a good idea to ask yourself,
 who's determined that it's toxic?
  </li><li>Yeah, that's good.
  </li><li>I think probably the key to the question
 you're asking is in or healing.
 I think healed up leaders are in short supply.
 And if you get your leaders healed of things
 like competition and rivalry and jealousy and insecurity
 and control and shame and all those ugly things
 that most Christians try and manage rather than evict.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Then your leaders become healthier
 and then your body becomes healthier.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's a lot like eating healthy,
 which you and I both obviously do and work out.
 You can't keep eating terribly
 and expect different results.
  </li><li>Right.
 I think that might be found under do as we say, not as we do.
 Right, exactly.
 Did you bring the cheetos?
 I did.
 Oh, I'll prepare over here.
 All right, perfect.
 The last question--
 gosh, Nathan, you asked four questions for the Bryce of One.
 This is brilliant.
 He asked, is praying daily for my church
 enough to cause revival and change of a healthy kind
 to happen in church?
 I'll tell you what I once heard John Arnott say it
 passes meeting.
 People would often ask him, why your church?
 Why did Toronto end up in revival?
 And he said he didn't know.
 And people would say, well, are you praying for revival?
 And he said, sure, but we weren't praying for revival
 more than any other church.
 And so I know that prayer for anything is really, really good.
 But I also think you can cultivate revival in your own life
 far easier than you can revival in an organization,
 especially if you're not a leader in that organization.
 So by all means, pray for revival for your church
 and for your nation.
 actually asking the Lord to stir up hunger in your own heart and to, you know, and I don't mean this. This sounds like it's a rebuke.
 I'm absolutely not rebuking you. Just in my own personal experience.
 It's amazing that when you're having your own personal revival that you think everything else is in revival, even if it isn't.
 So sure, go for prayer, but I don't think...
 I don't think the question is the right question. I don't think God measures
 amounts.
 You know what I mean?
 Yeah, like by the time you've you've prayed for revivals 68 times, then it'll hit right?
 I
 Think it's I think it the whole topic of revival. I love it and then I'm also sometimes really confused by it
 so one of the things that
 Bill Johnson talked about when we were at worship you was talking about how
 Your church the way you do worship the length of the sermon all that stuff
 All of that is the wine skin, but his presence is the wine and we can't neglect the wine and favor the wine skin
 right and at the same way
 You can't not take care of your wine skin because it's what supports the wine
 so
 I've been thinking a lot about like
 Revival and just you know, I've had seasons of my life where I just kind of
 Lock myself and my closet and just prayed all the time and stuff which is awesome. Those seasons are incredible
 but I also wonder about like the other part of
 you know what it means to live out the gospel and like helping one another and
 praying for one another and I think there's a certain thing about
 Not not wanting something just for yourself so much that you forget about the people around you
 Does that make sense?
  </li><li>It does.
  </li><li>So sometimes when I think about revival,
 I'm like, what am I actually praying for?
 Am I praying for that stuff would just blow up
 and we'd just be at the church all the time?
 Like, while that would be cool,
 I also am hoping that people's marriages would be great
 and that people get good jobs
 and aren't in debt anymore.
  </li><li>You know what I mean?
  </li><li>So as much as I love revival, sometimes I wonder,
 What exactly do I want to happen to this?
 Is it just 'cause it's exciting
 and it's different from just meeting on Sundays
 or is there, you know?
  </li><li>So much of God that you can't fit them
 into one service.
  </li><li>Right, yeah.
 I love all that.
  </li><li>I think the latter, yeah.
 Well, George Parsons,
 you do a very good AG Jones impersonation.
  </li><li>Oh, thank you.
