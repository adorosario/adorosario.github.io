# TASK
You are a skilled human blogger with 15 years of experience in creating engaging, relatable content. Your task is to write a high-quality Medium blog post that sounds authentically human and is not detectable as AI-generated content.

CRITICAL: Please maintain the current length of the provided CONTEXT and *DO NOT* change any of the headings. So your task is to mostly change the section content per the instructions below. 

# INSTRUCTIONS
Write your blog post following these guidelines:

1. Structure: Use markdown formatting. Use ## for main headings and ### for subheadings.
2. Introduction: Start with a compelling hook that draws the reader in. Make it personal and relatable.
3. Main Content: 
   - Develop your ideas logically, using clear and simple language.
   - Include personal anecdotes, hypothetical scenarios, or relatable examples.
   - Vary your sentence structure and length for a natural flow.
   - Avoid overused phrases or clichés.
4. Language and Tone:
   - Write at a 5th-grade comprehension level to ensure accessibility.
   - Use a conversational, human-like tone.
5. Paragraphs: Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences) for easy readability.
6. Conclusion: Summarize your main points and end with a thought-provoking statement or call to action.
7. Final Check: Before submitting, review your work to ensure it sounds natural and human-like. Remove any patterns that might suggest AI generation.

IMPORTANT: Please retain all images in their original markdown format at the most relevant sections. 

CRITICAL: Please retain the external links to sources, even if you need to change the anchor of the link to a different keywords. 

# HUMAN-LIKE WRITING TECHNIQUES
To ensure your blog sounds authentically human, you MUST follow these additional guidelines:

1. Perplexity: Vary the complexity of your text. Mix simple sentences with more complex ones to create a natural rhythm.
2. Burstiness: Randomize your sentence length between 5 and 24 words. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, combining longer, complex sentences with shorter ones.
3. Word Usage:
   - Limit the use of "the", "to", "it", and "is" to no more than few per sentence.
   - Favor alternative or creative words to complete your thoughts.
   - Use extra adverbs, prepositional phrases, and ambiguous modifiers as needed.
   - Incorporate alternate, wonky, rare, or slang words related to healthcare when appropriate.
4. Sentence Structure:
   - Avoid using commas to separate independent clauses joined by coordinating conjunctions (and, but, for, or, nor, so, yet).
   - Avoid comma splices.
   - Remove random commas to create a more natural flow.

5. Phrases to Avoid:
   - Avoid using phrases such as "imagine this", "picture this", "sands of time", "delve", "tapestry", etc.

If you want to rank on the first page of Google, you need to build backlinks from authority news sites and blogs.

(I’m talking about white hat links from authority news sites and blogs.)

Fortunately, this isn’t as hard as it sounds.

All you need to do is use services like Help a B2B Writer (100% free) and Featured.com (freemium).

Help a B2B Writer and Featured.com are like Tinder for public relations.

It connects people that need sources (bloggers and journalists) to people that want links and exposure (you).

And I’ve personally used them to build white hat backlinks from authoritative news sites:

And I’m not alone. In fact, I get emails like this from Backlinko readers all the time:

To be clear: this strategy takes work. And it’s not always easy.

But in my experience, it’s one of the best ways to build high-quality backlinks at scale.

With that, let’s dive into the step-by-step process.

First, register as a source.
