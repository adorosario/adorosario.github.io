        # CustomGPT.ai Researcher Documentation

A powerful AI Research Agent that conducts deep research and generates a detailed research article in 30 minutes.

## Quick Start

1. Visit [CustomGPT Researcher](https://researcher.customgpt.ai)
2. Enter your research topic or question
3. Wait 30-60 minutes while the agent:
   - Conducts thorough deep research (using Google or your custom knowledge)
   - Analyzes findings and knowledge from different perspectives. 
   - Generates a comprehensive research article with visual images. 

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Research Articles

- Be very specific about your research topic. Example: `Top 10 AI Research Agents : A Comprehensive Study`
- Include your tone, style and voice and any other pertinent information in the "Advanced Settings" [See Example](TONE.txt)
- Imagine you have a research assistant that is spending days on Google researching this topic. 

Examples:
```
✅ "The Impact Of Remote Work On Employee Productivity In Tech Companies Between 2020-2023"
❌ "Research remote work"
```

### Understanding Report Structure

Each research article covers various sections based on different perspectives. The content for the section is sourced from deep Google research that is then ingested into a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) project. 

1. Outline
2. Key Sections
3. Visual Images
4. Sources and Citations
5. FAQ

### Post-Processing Article

The research article will typically be about 6,000 word of deep-research output. Please treat it as a DRAFT that saves you time researching. DO NOT consider it as a finished article (you need to check facts and humanize further if needed -- Claude might be able to help)

You can also convert it into derivatives using Claude (recommended)

1. Blog posts (for SEO) : You can use this [prompt template](FINALIZE-WITH-CLAUDE.txt) to convert it into a 2000 word blog post in your style. 
2. Podcasts : You can use Google NotebookLM to [convert the article into a podcast like this](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5BrufFAH42hYWq4vwETRVy).  
3. Academic Paper: If you want to convert it into a different format, use a [prompt like this](FINALIZE-WITH-CLAUDE.txt) to convert the article. 

### Tips for Optimal Results

1. **Timing**: Allow the full 30-60 minutes for comprehensive research
2. **Scope**: Keep topics focused but not overly narrow
3. **Tone**: Provide tone and style (e.g. should it be academic? Or professional marketer?)

### Limitations

1. The researcher is currently free and limited to 3 articles per day. 
2. Please be mindful of other users (do not spam!)
3. This researcher is based on Google research OR your custom knowledge. It does not have access to private databases. 
4. This is "soft research" based on knowledge. It can't conduct chemical reactions and mathematical simulations at this time. 
5. Sources limited to publicly available information
6. Real-time data may have slight delays (if not available in Google)
7. Some paywalled content may be inaccessible

### Report Formats

Available report formats:
- Markdown
- Word (.docx)

## FAQs

**Q: Can I interrupt the research process?**

A: No. Once kicked off, you can't stop the job (so use your 3/day limit wisely)

**Q: How recent is the research data?**

A: The agent accesses the most current publicly available information at the time of research (so whatever is available on Google)

**Q: Can I save or export reports?**

A: Yes, reports can be downloaded in various formats including PDF and markdown. Just open the .docx in Google Docs and edit away.
