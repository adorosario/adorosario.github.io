Donald Trump is expected to empower the data center industry — figuratively and literally. 

A lack of electrical supply is hampering the construction of data centers that are needed to underpin the growth of AI and to make sure you can keep sneakily streaming the football game at the boring dinner party your spouse dragged you to.

Trump said he’s on it: He will promote the expansion of fossil fuel generation like coal and natural gas, as well as nuclear energy. And he has promised to strip away environmental protections and other regulations he says are preventing or slowing the development of new energy resources required to meet the data center industry’s rapidly growing needs.

“The general attitude is that there's lots of different ways to power data centers, and it feels like the administration that's coming in is going to broaden the scope of what is acceptable,” said Michael Rechtin, a partner in the data center practice at DLA Piper. “The industry is going to be happy about that.”
