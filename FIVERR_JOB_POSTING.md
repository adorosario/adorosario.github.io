## Red Flags (Auto-Reject)

‚ùå "I have experience but can't show my work (NDA)"
‚ùå "I'll need daily check-ins to stay on track"
‚ùå "I don't use GitHub but I'm willing to learn"
‚ùå "I don't have a Reddit account but I can create one"
‚ùå "Can we hop on a call to discuss?"
‚ùå Generic copy-paste proposal
‚ùå No specific examples or proof

---

## Timeline

- **Applications:** Review rolling (first come, first served)
- **Interviews:** Via GitHub issue (no calls)
- **Decision:** 24-48 hours
- **Onboarding:** 1 day (access provisioning)
- **Start:** Immediately
- **Trial:** 30 days
- **Go/No-Go:** Day 30 based on metrics

---

## Upside Potential

### If You Crush This (1,000+ visits in 30 days):
1. **Ongoing work:** $500-1,000/month for this site
2. **Scale to CustomGPT.ai:** Similar projects, higher budgets
3. **Portfolio piece:** "I drove 10,000+ monthly visits to AI-generated content site"
4. **Autonomy:** Continue working with ZERO management
5. **Growth:** Manage multiple sites as we scale

### If You're Just Okay (500-999 visits):
- Maybe continue at reduced hours
- Depends on efficiency and cost per click

### If You Fail (<500 visits):
- We part ways after 30 days
- You still get paid $400 (honor guarantee)

---

## How to Stand Out

### Great Applications Include:
- ‚úÖ Links to your Reddit profile showing expertise
- ‚úÖ Screenshots of traffic you've driven
- ‚úÖ GitHub issues you've managed autonomously
- ‚úÖ Specific, tactical plan for 30 days
- ‚úÖ Understanding of the autonomous work requirement
- ‚úÖ Examples of AI tool usage (Claude, ChatGPT)

### What I'm Looking For:
- Someone who says: "I got this, watch me work"
- Not: "Can you help me understand the requirements?"

---

## Questions? (Read This First!)

### Q: Can we schedule a call to discuss?
**A:** No. If you need a call to understand this, you're not the right fit.

### Q: Do you provide training on X tool?
**A:** No. Documentation is provided. You figure it out using AI/Google.

### Q: What if I get stuck?
**A:** Use Claude Code CLI, Google, YouTube, documentation. Post in GitHub issue if truly blocked.

### Q: How do I communicate with you?
**A:** GitHub issues only. I check every 2-3 days.

### Q: Is this really $5/hour?
**A:** Yes for trial. Scale to $10-15/hour if you crush it + CustomGPT projects.

### Q: What if I don't hit 1,000 visits?
**A:** You still get paid $400. But we don't continue.
