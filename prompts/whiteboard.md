Imagine a panoramic photograph taken with a smartphone, capturing a glass whiteboard in a high-rise office overlooking Boston's iconic Charles River. In the frame, a woman is writing on the board, wearing a t-shirt prominently displaying the CustomGPT.ai logo. Her handwriting appears natural and slightly messy, and the photographer's reflection is subtly visible in the glass.

The whiteboard contains the following text:

**Left Side:**
Why NOT to build your own RAG:
- Complex & costly
- Security nightmares (leaks!)
- Endless maintenance
- Hard to find & keep talent
- High latency issues

**Right Side:**
Better way:
- Buy proven RAG solutions
- Security & compliance built-in
- Focus on your core biz
- Get expert support
- Build only if truly unique!

make sure Boston's iconic Charles River and skyscraper landscape is visible on the right hand side through the window.
