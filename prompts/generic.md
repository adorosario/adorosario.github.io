Imagine a panoramic photograph taken with a smartphone, capturing a glass whiteboard in a high-rise office overlooking Boston's iconic Charles River. In the frame, a woman is writing on the board, wearing a t-shirt prominently displaying the logo for Bing. Her handwriting appears natural and slightly messy, and the photographer's reflection is subtly visible in the glass. The contents of the whiteboard should be based on scribblings related to the following article -- ideally some sort of infographic along with explanations, assuming that this girl is trying to explain the article.

Focus on Bing — Not Google — For AEO, Here Is Why …

A few day ago, I published my article “ChatGPT Clicks Convert 6.8X Higher Than Google Organic” here on Medium, and the #1 question flooding my inbox has been:

How do I optimize my website for AEO (AI Engine Optimization)?

If you haven’t read the data-backed article yet, do that first. The findings are eye-opening.

ChatGPT Clicks Convert 6.8X Higher Than Google Organic
While comparing Google Organic to ChatGPT, I see that ChatGPT brings in just 4% of the traffic, but 22% of the…

But if you want my one-word ADHD response to the AEO question: Bing.

Now, just to be clear — I’m NOT an SEO or AEO specialist. There are far more experienced folks than me in that arena.

But having analyzed the conversion data and seen the writing on the wall, here’s my perspective:

1. Focus on Bing, Not Google
Look, I know this sounds counterintuitive. Google has dominated search for so long that “Google it” became a verb. But here’s the reality:

Bing powers most of the AI answer engines — ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and influences Perplexity too.
Google still holds massive market share, but extracting growth from Google is like trying to juice water from a rock at this point.
While everyone else is battling for tiny gains in the Google ecosystem — all while Google is rapidly changing its algorithm and juicing every dollar from its paid ads — there’s significantly less competition in optimizing for Bing — which now has outsized importance thanks to its role in powering AI responses.


How to Actually Optimize for Bing (Actionable Steps):
Exact Keyword Usage: Unlike Google, Bing places higher emphasis on exact-match keywords. Include your target keywords in titles, H1/H2 tags, meta descriptions, and within the first 100 words of content.
Focus on High-Quality Backlinks: Bing prioritizes quality over quantity. Aim for backlinks from older, established domains and authoritative sites (.edu, .gov) rather than chasing volume.
Optimize for Social Signals: Unlike Google, Bing actually considers social media signals as ranking factors. Promote your content actively across social platforms to improve engagement and visibility. (PS: The one exception : Lately Google seems to love Reddit)
Submit Your Sitemap: Use Bing Webmaster Tools to submit your sitemap directly. This helps Bing crawl and index your content more effectively. (Yeah, I know this sounds basic — but it’s the least you can do)
Consider Meta Keywords: While Google ignores meta keywords, Bing still gives them some weight. Include relevant, targeted keywords in your meta tags.
This isn’t just theory. Our data shows that clicks from ChatGPT (which has ties to Bing’s index) convert at 6.8X the rate of Google organic traffic. That’s not a minor improvement — it’s a major difference for reasons mentioned below.

2. Focus on Conversions, Not Traffic
The old SEO playbook was simple: more traffic = more success. That’s outdated thinking.

In our analysis, ChatGPT drove just 4% of our traffic but accounted for 22% of conversions. Think about that — a traffic source that represents a tiny fraction of visitors but delivers over one-fifth of your business outcomes.


And here is the most scary thing: Answer engines like ChatGPT and Perplexity are just getting started — but growing 44% month-over-month. Most of the world hasn’t even heard about these engines yet. In fact, ChatGPT with free search was introduced just a month ago.

Conversion-Focused Actions to Take Today:
Track AI Source Conversions: ChatGPT uses utm_source=chatgpt.com in its outgoing clicks — start tracking those in your GA4. Perplexity sends the Referer header (here is my conversation with Perplexity cofounder, Johnny Ho)
Optimize Landing Pages for AI Visitors: Create dedicated landing pages that acknowledge the context visitors already have from their AI conversation (e.g., “As you may have discovered in ChatGPT…”). Since ChatGPT sends the utm_source=chatgpt.com param, you could potentially customize the user experience based on that.
Create Content Assets for AI Citations: Develop high-value resources specifically designed to be cited by AI engines — comprehensive guides, original research, and definitive answers to common questions. While answering questions like “How”, “What”, etc is facing a decline in organic Google search, the content from these is what feeds the AI engines. Do a content gap analysis on your website to see what authoritative questions are missing from your website content.
This is the quality vs. quantity debate settled with hard data. I’d rather have 100 highly qualified visitors than 10,000 casual browsers any day.

3. Focus on Chat, Not Pageviews
The conversational nature of AI answer engines fundamentally changes user expectations. When someone clicks through from ChatGPT to your site, they’ve already had a conversation about your topic. They’re primed, informed, and ready to engage.

Why You Need a Custom Chatbot on Your Website:
Today’s visitors are becoming increasingly “AI-first” in their thinking. They’re comfortable with conversational interfaces and often prefer them to traditional page navigation.

Remember: AI is the new UI

Here’s why implementing a custom chatbot on your site is no longer optional:

Match User Expectations: Visitors coming from ChatGPT or similar tools are already in a conversational mindset. A custom chatbot provides continuity in their experience.
Instant Information Access: Traditional website navigation forces users to hunt through page hierarchies. A custom chatbot lets them simply ask for what they need.
Personalized Content Delivery: AI chatbots can tailor responses based on user context, delivering exactly what each visitor needs without overwhelming them.
Enhanced Data Collection: Chatbot conversations provide invaluable insights into what your visitors actually want to know — information you can use to improve your content strategy. The chat logs are a goldmine of information for you to inform your conversion and content strategy.
24/7 Engagement: A well-trained chatbot provides immediate responses at any hour — and any language — keeping potential customers engaged when your team is offline. (Tip: This is doubly true if your customers are more active during off hours — like divorce law or plumbing services)
Tools like ChatGPT or onsite custom chatbots are pre-cooking and pre-selling the user so that they are all ready to buy.

Actionable Steps for Chat Optimization:
Implement a Custom-Trained AI Chatbot: Use no-code platforms to create a custom chatbot specifically trained on your content.
Provide Your Bot with Starter Questions: Use actual customer inquiries to provide your user with starter questions. You can also easily customize your bot in plain English to act in a certain way by providing it with a custom persona.
Create Conversational Paths to Conversion: Design chat flows that naturally guide users toward key conversion points. Using plain English, you can instruct the bot to end responses with a path to your conversion action (e.g. “Signup for our 7-day free trial” or “Contact us and ask about this month’s special offer”)
Monitor and Improve: Regularly review chatbot interactions to identify gaps in knowledge or opportunities for improved response.
Remember: Antiquated page structures and traditional site navigation are increasingly barriers to conversion for AI-native users. A conversational interface removes these friction points.

What This Means for Your Strategy (Actionable Takeaways)
If you’re a digital marketer or business owner right now, consider this a rare opportunity. While your competitors continue throwing resources at saturated Google optimization strategies, you can:

Audit Your Bing Performance Today: Use Bing Webmaster Tools to assess your current visibility and identify quick optimization opportunities.
Structure Content for AI Readability: Implement clear headings, FAQs, structured data, and summary sections to make your content AI-friendly. AND: Answer those questions related to your niche.
Set Up AI Traffic Tracking: Create conversion tracking and custom reports in GA4 to track traffic and conversions from ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other AI sources.
Implement a Custom Chatbot Strategy: Don’t just add a generic antiquated chatbot like Intercom — develop a strategy for how a custom conversational interface can enhance your specific user journey.
Develop a AEO Plan: Work with your SEO team or agency to create a specific strategy that prioritizes AEO alongside (not instead of) Google.
The shift to AI-driven answers isn’t just coming — it’s already here. And based on our data, the conversion potential is too significant to ignore. The websites that adapt fastest will capture disproportionate value in this new ecosystem.

I’d love to hear if you’ve noticed similar patterns with AEO driven conversions or if you’ve implemented any of these strategies. Drop your experiences in the comments!
