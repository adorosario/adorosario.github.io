Imagine a panoramic photograph taken with a smartphone, capturing a glass whiteboard in a high-rise office overlooking Boston's iconic Charles River. In the frame, a woman is writing on the board, wearing a t-shirt prominently displaying the logo for "AI Prompts for Entrepreneurs". Her handwriting appears natural and slightly messy, and the photographer's reflection is subtly visible in the glass.

The whiteboard contains the following text:
